# [EDIT ME: App Name] — Pro Se Case Companion for Michigan

Not a lawyer. Not legal advice. Procedural help + document organization only.

## Purpose
This project pivots the original enterprise forensic OS into a trauma‑informed, pro se companion focused on Michigan civil litigation workflows. It keeps the evidence vault, audit trails, and export integrity, while adding procedural gating, deadline tracking, and filing‑ready packet assembly.

## Core Capabilities
- Evidence vault with hash integrity and audit trails.
- Procedural rule engine for Michigan civil timelines.
- PII scan + MC97 protected list generator before public exports.
- Filing, service, and trial binder packet exports with manifests.
- Case Flow hub with step-gated lifecycle tracking.
- Case Narrative + Forensic Dossier (evidence-anchored).

## Planned / Backlog (In Design)
- CourtProfile overrides (Oakland Circuit + 50th District).
- Pre-file audit gate (format, signature, PII, attachments).
- SCAO form library (MC 01/01b/03/07/07a/11/12/13/19/97).
- Exhibit index + binder auto-generation.
- Advanced Video Forensics Lab (C2PA 2.2, ZKP integrity, sub-frame analysis).
- Dual-track module for wage/retaliation (kept separate from assault flow).

## Quick Start
- Run client + server: `npm run dev`
- Run server tests: `npm test`
