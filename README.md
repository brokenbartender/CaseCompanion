# [EDIT ME: App Name] — Pro Se Case Companion for Michigan

Not a lawyer. Not legal advice. Procedural help + document organization only.

## Purpose
This project pivots the original enterprise forensic OS into a trauma‑informed, pro se companion focused on Michigan civil litigation workflows. It keeps the evidence vault, audit trails, and export integrity, while adding procedural gating, deadline tracking, and filing‑ready packet assembly.

## Core Capabilities
- Evidence vault with hash integrity and audit trails.
- Procedural rule engine for Michigan civil timelines.
- PII scan + MC97 protected list generator before public exports.
- Filing, service, and trial binder packet exports with manifests.

## Quick Start
- Run client + server: `npm run dev`
- Run server tests: `npm test`

## Docs
- Pro se Michigan architecture overview: `docs/pro-se-michigan/README.md`
- Security posture: `SECURITY.md`

## Safety
This tool does not provide legal advice, legal strategy, or court filing automation. Always verify deadlines and local rules with the court.
