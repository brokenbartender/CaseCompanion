# Cold Outreach Templates

## Template A — The Fear
Subject: Liability is the new breach (and standard RAG won’t save you).

Hi {{FirstName}},

Most legal AI tools *sound* confident even when they’re wrong. That’s a liability problem, not a UX quirk. Standard RAG is not legally defensible because it can’t prove that an answer is grounded in evidence.

LexiPro blocks that risk with the **Semantic Adversary** (Patent Pending). Every claim is forced through deterministic citation gating *and* semantic verification. If it can’t be proven, it’s rejected at the API boundary.

If you want to see a live demo, I can show you the chain-of-custody audit and the proof packet in 10 minutes.

Open to a quick walkthrough?

## Template B — The Tech
Subject: Deleted data that stays deleted (Cryptographic Shredding).

Hi {{FirstName}},

We shipped forensic-grade AI with **Cryptographic Shredding**. When a workspace is deleted, its encryption key is destroyed, and the data becomes mathematically unrecoverable — even if a backup leaks.

This isn’t “best effort” security. It’s irreversible deletion by design, built for legal and compliance environments.

I’d love to show you the technical flow if you’re curious.

## Template C — The Acquisition
Subject: Acquiring a fully grounded Legal OS (with a provisional patent package).

Hi {{FirstName}},

We’ve built a forensic-grade Legal OS with grounded AI, cryptographic audit logs, and court-ready proof packaging. It’s designed for acquisition or strategic partnership — not just pilot tests.

The deal includes a **Provisional Patent Package** covering the Hallucination Killer / Semantic Adversary system.

If you’re exploring M&A or strategic buys, we can share the diligence packet and a 15-minute product tour.

Worth a quick conversation?
