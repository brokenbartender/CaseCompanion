# Research and Benchmark Consolidation

This note consolidates the research-only sources already added to the backlog.
Goal: avoid duplicates and keep only US-relevant tools or QA safeguards.

## Consolidated Sources
- OpenContracts / OpenClaw / SSRN AI research
- LegalBench benchmark
- OLAW research framework
- Legal Text Analytics curated list
- Awesome LegalAI Resources list
- LegalNexus RAG architecture

## Outcome
- Keep a short list of US-relevant extraction and QA tools.
- Avoid non-US legal datasets for case guidance.
- Focus on guardrails, retrieval quality, and evidence grounding.
