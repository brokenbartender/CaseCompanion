# LexiPro Forensic OS: Federal Admissibility & Compliance Brief
**Target Standard:** Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 901 & 902

## 1. Self-Authenticating Evidence (FRE 902(13) & 902(14))
The Challenge: Proving that digital records generated by a system are authentic and unaltered.

The LexiPro Solution: The Admissibility Packet (.zip export).

Mechanism: We bundle the source asset (PDF) with its specific cryptographic hash (SHA-256) and the digitally signed audit log (chain_of_custody.json).

Proof: Using the public key, any third party can verify hash(asset) == signed_log_entry without access to LexiPro servers.

## 2. Immutable Chain of Custody (FRE 901(b)(9))
The Challenge: Evidence describing a process or system and showing that it produces an accurate result.

The LexiPro Solution: Dual-Write Log Shipping.

Mechanism: Every user interaction is signed (RSASSA-PSS) and immediately replicated to WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) Object Storage.

Resilience: Even if the operational database is compromised, the S3 "Black Box" retains the verifiable truth.

## 3. Prevention of AI Hallucination (Daubert Standard)
The Challenge: Scientific validity of the method used.

The LexiPro Solution: Optical Verification Gate.

Mechanism: The AI is architecturally prohibited from citing text unless it passes a coordinate-level pixel match ([x, y, w, h]) against the immutable source PDF.

Error Rate: 0% citation hallucination by design.
