# Pro Se Michigan Companion

Not a lawyer. Not legal advice. Procedural help + document organization only.

## Goals
- Provide a Michigan civil litigation workflow engine for pro se users.
- Enforce deadlines, required artifacts, and cure paths without giving legal strategy.
- Maintain evidence integrity, audit logs, and export manifests.

## What This Is Not
- Not an AI lawyer.
- Not court filing automation.
- Not a substitute for local rule verification.

## Modules (Foundational)
- Case Status Dashboard (deadlines + next actions)
- Evidence Vault + Exhibit Builder
- PII Scan + MC97 protected list generator
- Filing Packet export (complaint/summons placeholders + manifest)
- Service Packet + Trial Binder exports
- Service Attempt tracker + signature/PII gates

## Data-Driven Court Profiles
Local rules are modeled as `CourtProfile` overrides rather than hard-coded assumptions. Configure them per court or judge as needed.
