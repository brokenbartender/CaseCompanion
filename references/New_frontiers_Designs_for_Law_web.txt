1. NEW FRONTIERS OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE:
HOW DESIGN PROVOTYPES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
LEGAL CHANGE

Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

Abstract
Legal change is a complex phenomenon. Transplants, imitations, borrowings, as-
similations by chance or for prestige, adoptions and rejections, and cross-fertil-
isation are all dynamic processes, which correspond to the past and the present
of world legal systems—and they are not just a matter of the “sovereign will” of a
state and its sovereign power. Beyond the state, supranational institutions of var-
ious kinds are the global agents responsible for shaping legal order reform. Their
actions are the preserve of a multitude of forces, including transnational epistemic
communities across the globe. What is less explored is how legal change can be
the outcome of individual and collective actions, in an age when, for the first time
in human history, social organisations depend on the use of information and com-
munication technologies (ICTs). This fact radically affects the legal sphere. How do
these collectives and individuals exercise their rights and how are they reminded
of their duties, thus playing a major role in delineating the boundaries of the re-
lationship between themselves, legal institutions, and legal change? What legal
change is implied by the empirical analysis of the social acts involved in what they
do? While legal transplantation theory explicitly deals with how legal change is
produced with reference to national and transnational legal institutions, the rec-
ognition of speculative design practice in the legal domain can raise awareness
of pressing societal issues and bolster individual and collective civic agency over
transformation and legal change, through imagination and critical thinking.

1. Legal Change: Setting the Scene and its Narratives

Legal change can be described through the agents vested with the pow-
er to change the law.

  The following are the main (simplified) narratives aimed at recon-
structing legal change from the modern era to the present day; they
constitute a minimum common ground of shared knowledge between
28  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

jurists and designers, a starting point for contributing to a critical and
speculative reflection on future scenarios about legal change.

  In Western legal tradition, the agents of legal change are judges and
lawmakers, with the former acting through case law, and the latter
through government and parliamentary legislation. Legitimised from
below, as institutions of the Rechtsstaat founded on the archetype of
the will of the people, these agents decide whether to adopt or reject
legal change, controlling it within state borders, with the aim of arriving
at new and more efficient legal solutions for fairer legislative reform.
The Western-style sovereign state therefore assumes that changes in
legal rules are the result of a complex function that is entirely internal
to its organs, in which an independent body of specialist-expert judges,
together with good legislative practice by state officials, can be steered
towards specific policy objectives, such as the recognition of human
rights, democratic values, non-discrimination principles and justice, im-
proved economic performance, greater investments and efficiency (but
also towards diametrically opposed political goals, as was the case with
the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe). It later also assumed that good rules
can be exported to countries transitioning to democracy and the market,
because most legal rules can operate in very different societies from the
one for which they were originally created through the almost surgical
operation of “legal transplants,” to use the fortunate expression coined
by Alan Watson (1974).

  This first narrative of legal change characterised the modern era until
the Second World War. It then came to overlap with a more complex
transnational narrative, which ever since the Bretton Woods agreements
has been guided by economic liberalism and legal functionalism. Private
international financial institutions and corporations regarded the World
Bank’s activities (granting of loans) as complementary to their interests:
public works projects to improve the economic infrastructure could only
be good for private foreign investors, too.

  The fundamental idea is that policy choices and legal rules have a di-
rect effect on the functioning of markets and economic growth, with
spill-over effects on sectors not directly dependent on economic mech-
anisms. In this transnational dimension,1 multiple agents steer legal

change. On these premises, over the last fifty years, the dynamics of
legal change have been based on specific alliances between states, form-
ing more or less cooperative networks that act at different speeds. Such
alliances range from the maximalist political and economic integration
model of the European Union and its Member States, to the minimalist
model of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), created in the
wake of the break-up of the Soviet Union to prevent the sudden disap-
pearance of an alliance system that for seventy years had kept the So-
viet Socialist Republics together; from purely economic cooperation for
the elimination of tariff barriers –operating on a macro or mega-regional
scale, where for macro-areas we have, for instance, the United States–
Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA, formerly NAFTA) in North-Central
America, the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and
Trade Agreement (CETA), the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the Per-
sian Gulf, the ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement in Southeast Asia, or
the MERCOSUR in Latin America; and for mega-areas we have, for ex-
ample, the World Trade Organization (WTO), which deals with the global
rules of trade between nations, and the Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)– to cooperation that
integrates economic aspects into a future framework of political inte-
gration, such as the Andean Community, the Union of South American
Nations (UNASUR), the African Union, the Arab League, and the Council
of Europe, to name but a few. By accommodating these transnational
dynamics, legal change is driven by a range of factors, which can be
simplified in terms of military force, political influence, and economic
power, even once colonialism had ceased. Of these three factors, im-
proving economic performance is perhaps the most visible goal in terms
of joint statements and declarations of intent; however, it is also the
least relevant for the dynamics of legal change, as what usually matters
most in these cases is not the effectiveness of legal reform, but the repu-
tation-based legitimacy acquired by joining a prestigious “club of peers”
or group of “reliable states.”

in general terms, is the law that regulates actions or events that transcend national
borders, including both public and private international law, as well as other rules
that fall outside the national source system (post-Westphalian model)’.
30  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

  Regional or international financial organisations, such as the EBRD in
Europe, the IMF, or the World Bank,2 often fund legal change processes,
but they propose a “one size fits all” approach to be implemented as
quickly as possible, with funding conditional on the adoption by recip-
ient countries of the rule of law and democratic reforms. By proposing
the adoption of economic theories and models that make the effec-
tiveness of legal change dependent on the time needed to evaluate its
effects on markets’ performances, legal systems become market-de-
pendent variables. In this functionalist paradigm, legal rules become a
tool of social engineering, a mere technique of utility in the service of
better economic performance.

  Endorsing this approach and its neo-liberalist version, other players
have joined in the global dissemination of standardised, high-perfor-
mance rules. They include not only public entities, but also private, or
public-private, organizations, foundations, associations, corporations,
professional firms, NGOs from all sectors, standardisation organisations–
such as, for example, the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO), and ICANN, a US-based non-profit corporation with global capi-
tal, which manages the domain name system–, and even big law firms,
that have an exceptional regulatory role and play an important part in
processes of legal change through contractual instruments and property
rights adjudication procedures.3

     ateri and other younger scholars belonging to the Turin school of comparative law
     founded by Rodolfo Sacco, in dialogue with other leading thinkers, from Norber-
     to Bobbio and Sabino Cassese, not only in the field of law— to Duncan Kennedy,

  Non-state regulatory solutions are, de facto, extremely pervasive in
the post-Westphalian environment. Tech giants, with their technologi-
cal management of the Internet, show how technology can transform
the way regulatory and legal functions are performed nowadays, in the
space that Roger Brownsword called “the Law 3.0”.4 Technology is chang-
ing both the idea of existing law as a coherent system of legal rules and
standards, and the way that lawyers, judges, and legislators think about
the law’s role, and about the national and international architecture of
legal and regulatory institutions, including whether A.I. and algorithms
could count as legitimate institutions as well.5

  Our regulatory mind-set needs then to focus on the disruption of the
fundamental assumptions on which traditional legal thinking is built, and
to take up the challenge on the monopoly concentrations of the “atten-
tion merchants”6 and their business models in terms of data access/data
protection. This is our time, the time we live in, where “code” and “ar-
chitecture” can be more important than formal laws, where IT program-
mers, computer scientists and neuroscientist teams have a greater effect
on a risk management approach to law than the legislators. It is, indeed,
the “architecture” that Lawrence Lessig, in his seminal essay, called
“code” 7 that plays the most important role today, in the digital ecosys-
tem in which not only markets, but also our social relations have been
moving for some time. The Internet is more subject to non-state forms
of control than the offline world.8 And it could not be otherwise. The
Internet is (for now) entirely human-made, and it is online that “code” is
the most powerful lever for shaping and regulating our behaviours.

  These continuous transformations of the normative dimension have
led political and economic uncertainty to grow worldwide.

  In such a complex framework, agents of legal change also seek to
measure the effects of their reforms and understand whether time is
still an essential factor for reforms to take root—as it was in the past,
when the control and steering of legal change was firmly in the hands
of the state, and local epistemic communities9 could be swayed to
construct a consensus for a reform. But the quantitative analyses, and
the Law and Finance theory as initiated by La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes,
Shleifer, and Vishny10 appear to be backward-looking reference systems
of knowledge, based on “historical evidence”–as they investigated the
differences between legal origins and their impact on economic perfor-
mance–especially when compared to new ways of understanding com-
plex phenomena, as will be discussed in the following pages.

  What has been said so far also applies to non-Western legal traditions,
although the main drivers for legal change were, and are, other things:
mainly the ideology of the group or party in power, tradition, religion,
chance, and even personal factors. This can be seen in the legal systems
of the Islamic world, the Indian subcontinent, Far East Asia and in sub-Sa-
haran African traditions, where legal change has coincided with the his-
tory of colonisation, coups d’état, and non-pacific revolutions, and with
the international trade routes marked out by the pressures of interest
groups and personal contacts.11 But when looking at non-Western con-
texts, what matters above all is “the process” of legal change; a process
that unfolds shaped by both the supply side of the reforms, which is
generally indifferent to or unaware of the framework in which new legal
rules will be received, and the demand side, which often does not un-
derstand or is indifferent to the specific content of the new legal rules

     level and are dependent on privileges granted by the state see Brook Harrington

(examples of content include redistributive effects, the degree of com-
patibility with pre-existing legal rules in the system, the time required
for adaptation to the local hermeneutic tradition, etc.). The supply/de-
mand division reflects the tension between the legal change and the
framework for its reception—a tension that is more significant where
countries are less homogeneous than, for example, EU Member States
following their European political and economic integration. Thus, at the
root of legal change processes we find a lack of understanding, a net-
work of informational asymmetries, and fallacious simplifications that
are of little help in grasping the various facets of legal change, in particu-
lar of legal transplants shaped by religious factors, personal interests,
chance and prestige.12

  In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and the fears and negative
effects associated with the transnational dynamics of Covid-19, Western
and Global North institutions are fully aware of how legal changes are
complex and non-linear multifactor processes, with no clear boundaries
between what is local (nationalism) and what is global (transnational-
ism/supranationalism).13 Instead they are mutually constitutive dynam-
ics, in which local and global construct each other, becoming “glocal”.
Local customs, practices, and traditions are real elements of all legal sys-
tems, not a cultural invention in response to the neoliberal international
legal order. 14

  What we are therefore experiencing today on a global level is the con-
tradictory coexistence of very different regulatory systems: on the one
hand, customary rules, practices, and traditions that are the effective
components of all legal systems; and on the other, the architecture of
the Internet, and coding techniques, which are equally real elements of

contemporary legal systems. As such, they raise issues of justice, respon-
sibility, sustainability, and solidarity.

2. Legal Change: The Good Practice of Interdisciplinary Research in
Comparative Law

Comparative law, like other domains of study, looks at legal knowledge
from an interdisciplinary point of view. Legal knowledge has porous
boundaries and fault lines. By displaying overarching patterns of differ-
ence and similarity, comparative law has, for some time now, opened
the “black box” of law, revealing its many dimensions and pushing for an
examination of the actual and potential possibilities available when legal
change is necessary or desired.

  The consolidation of interdisciplinary approaches has led comparative
law to tap into a composite and collective knowledge that is methodo-
logically robust and, at the same time, flexible and not self-referential.
After all, stateless issues such as global warming, environmental destruc-
tion, social injustice, poverty, natural disasters, and pandemics are not
inevitable events, or the result of historical determinism, and can only
be addressed by bringing together different disciplines, practising in-
terdisciplinarity, and pursuing wide-scale participatory action—without
which the well-known goals of the UN 2030 Agenda, “a plan of action for
people, planet and prosperity”, as it states in its preamble,15 will remain
a dead letter.

  Interdisciplinary inquiry, for instance, has brought to light the deep
malaise in Western legal and political thought based on the values of civ-
ilised nations.16 The dualistic tendency it shows of identifying bad local
rules based on tradition, implying they are synonymous with backward-
ness, and good global norms of a universal, cosmopolitan, and rational
nature, based on the supposed existence of a natural law (for which one
is against landmines/for the protection of dolphins, against racism/for
equal gender rights, against genocide/for human rights, etc.) has been

15 See <https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda> accessed 12 January 2023.
16 The charter of the International Court of Justice is also based on these principles:

     (1922–2018) (Brill Nijhoff 2020).
New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  35

widely commented on and criticised as a functionalist approach to legal
change based on the so-called “Washington consensus,” leading to the
“Americanisation” of the world17—although the same can be said today
about Europe and the so-called “Brussels effect” beyond European bor-
ders.18

  Interdisciplinary inquiry, furthermore, has provided an alternative ex-
planation in response to the observation that many rules that have been
imitated or transplanted have remained on paper and have not always
produced the legal uniformity hoped for in terms of promoting trade and
better market performance. Scholars usually proceed with a historical
analysis to explain that it is all the fault of the past which conditions the
present, and that legal change is bound to events that happened in the
past, as taught by the path dependency theory. Those past events have
a solid impact on legal culture, which becomes the catch-all factor that is
used to emphasise how and how much the past conditions the present.
But this explanation only partially satisfies us.

  In countries in transition and in the Global South, the ineffectiveness
of legal change is usually associated with the antagonistic relationship
that arises between local institutions and role-occupants (generally
judges, public officials, and Western consultants) sent to carry out re-
forms or provide local training, who treat legal data according to the
principle of the indifference and technical neutrality of the law,19 for
which societies that are different from each other can be governed by
the same rules.20 That same mechanism, however, is also observed in

the legal systems of the Global North, where the failure of legal reforms
carried out according to the functionalist approach is associated with
the dialectical tension between the autonomy of local constituencies
and the central institutions that impose top-down legal reforms. Empiri-
cal observation studies suggest that resistance to change is not linked to
cultural differences, as an exoticising view of non-Western laws might in-
itially seem to suggest.21 Reiterated conclusions as to the ineffectiveness
of legal change when pursued according to the abstract model of legal
transplants and the logic of “one size fits all” have recently prompted le-
gal scholars to explore the deeper relationship between law, considered
the main tool of legal change, and “societal forces”, “different vested
interests,” and “political interests”.22 Thus, it turns out that legal change,
in both the Global South and the Global North, depends on a number
of additional variables, such as the effects of informal processes on the
standardised discourse about the rule of law and democracy, political
choices and ideology, the role of cryptotypes, and customary practices
shaping implementational rules, as well as social practices that shape
the law.23 This implicit dimension of normativity that silently rules the
actions of individuals and communities may in fact be unveiled by ap-
plying the normative variant of Paul Grice’s theory of conversation de-
veloped by Marina Sbisa,24 and Rodolfo Sacco’s theory of cryptotypes:25
the “underlying patterns” can be revealed, or made visible through mi-

cro-comparisons of legal rules among different legal systems. The dis-
covery of a cryptotype is facilitated when, as happens, a legal rule, a
concept, or a principle implicit in one legal system is explicit in another
one. By logical and non-logical inferences of textual information from an
explicit rule, pragmatics tools unveil the connections between what lies
outside the text and what is inside it, what can plausibly be considered
as part of what a statute, a judgment, or a decree communicated when
it was produced, and what can enrich a legal rule without affecting its
truth value.26

  In the background lies the idea that law is a socially valuable practice
of regulation in a given time and place, a practice that reflects the vari-
ability of socio-legal conditions and contexts.27 What thus counts in de-
fining what is legal are particular social settings: law is not only what law
officials do and say they are doing, it is also a reflection of social values,
educational conditioning, ideology and economics.28

  The law then can appear for what it is: an interpretative socially valu-
able practice of formal regulations and customary rules in a given time
and place, made up of embodied subjectivities that find protection un-
der a wider notion of “citizenship” as part of the legal change itself; a
procedural notion of citizenship, understood as the social process of be-
ing engaged that facilitates cohesion, rather than a status, or a goal in
itself (a reward for being integrated) is then needed.

3. Choice is Good, but Community Engagement is Better: Citizenship

The uglier face of globalisation is shown when the law and legal change
processes admit their powerlessness in setting out the moral limits of
markets. One remedy that is often proposed is to lower their level of
complexity and then essentially solve the problem by reducing it to a
matter of self-determination and freedom of choice—because “choice

is good”.29 Such a solution, however, is not altogether convincing. We
believe that the question—or rather, the questions—should be restated:
how can states, markets, and other players involved in legal change—
both in the Global South and in advanced post-industrial, multicultural
countries—come to terms with deeply-rooted social structures that they
cannot change? To what extent does public opinion impact public poli-
cy? What difference does individual behaviour make? How do networks
of higher civil service elites (public administration, public management,
judiciary, etc.) shape legal change? In identifying the institutions that or-
ganise social, economic, and political interaction, can we also say, draw-
ing from cognitive science and ethnology, that the human mind “is the
first institution”, one shared by all human societies? Might the unity of
the human mind—because all humans share important common cogni-
tive frameworks, both with each other and with other hominids30—be a
crucial factor in social organisation and legal change?

  It is at this point that a broad vision of citizenship comes into play.
Based on active community engagement, it is citizenship understood as
a social process in which the greatest possible number of people par-
take;31 and not only humans,32 considering that the general principles of

     Ciacchi, Chantal Mak, Zeeshan Mansoor (eds), Immoral Contracts in Europe (In-
     tersentia 2020).

30 We have an innate ability for the “mental score-keeping of services,” that is, a
     mechanism for social exchange based on reciprocity, as psychological, anthropo-
     logical, and ethnological studies appear to show; see Raffaele Caterina, ‘Compar-

perceptual organisation and the common framework of basic assump-
tions of the world, built on our genetic system, are something we share
with all species, or at least with all vertebrates.

  The citizenship debate first originated from concerns about social co-
hesion and the maintenance of public order in nation-states. It was a
censorious citizenship33 that arose within certain territorial boundaries,
based on a legitimisation of sovereignty of an ascending (from the peo-
ple), and no longer descending (from the divine) kind, referring to the
people, the nation, a singular identity.34 Today, the criteria for becoming
a citizen contained in national legislations have in practice become ob-
stacles to achieving citizenship itself, and to integration.35

  One of the basic principles of liberal states is that all citizens are for-
mally equal to each other and before the law. But as we all know, the
equality of citizens is intersected by many inequalities (by ethnicity, gen-
der, physical and mental disability, income, and so on) and compromised
by the substantial exclusion to the enjoyment of rights for noncitizens
(migrants, asylum seekers, refugees). For if there were no inequalities,
there would indeed be no need for anti-discrimination laws and inclu-
sion practices.

  Today, moreover, there can be no citizenship without taking the digital
dimension into account, just as there can be no “mature citizens” re-
gardless of the digital dimension.36 The point is not only the recognition
of a digital citizenship that has broken through the territorial bounda-
ries of nation-states, expanding to coincide with the concept of “neti-

zenship”—from [Inter]net + [cit]izenship.37 Current research is outlining
the figure of the “happy citizen”38 based on the principle of well-being,
as intangible collective capital, which is expressed in the preservation
and transmission of cultural heritage, collective memory, political par-
ticipation, peace, environmentalism, social equity and the inclusion of
minorities and vulnerable social groups. The idea of happy citizenship is
already at the core of political and regulatory decisions aimed at increas-
ing people’s well-being and life satisfaction, as witnessed by the OECD
projects.39

  The relationship between citizenship and the ideals of happiness
and well-being, integration, and equality is complex. In particular, the
goals of citizenship policies are not well defined, and generally at odds
with those of immigration. Among other things, the differentiation be-
tween citizens and noncitizens sharpens when migrants travel mainly
in South-North and East-West directions.40 This makes it desirable to
have a flexible notion of citizenship, based on solidarity-building mech-
anisms, traceable to the idea of pan-citizenship, to help further active
community engagement41 and greater tolerance of different lifestyles
and values, a notion that embraces social responsibility and aims to re-
duce the number of people with extremely limited rights. That means a
broader definition of citizen to include migrants, refugees, and marginal-
ised people in general, with stronger value placed on active community
engagement. Here, public participation goes beyond the turnout of vot-

4. The Contestability of Decision-Making Processes and the Micro-Di-
mension of Persons as Agents of Legal Change

In thinking about legal change, the focus should therefore be shifted onto
the dialectic between policy-making and the law. It can be observed how
the domestic politics of states and major changes within the national
political arena project outwards and reshape the legal structure of the
global system.45 Law cannot act as a substitute for political choices, as
witnessed by the adjudication process46—a privileged site of interaction
between the legal and the political—and by widely documented policy
transfers.47 While it is true that legal change is based on selective ad-

aptation under the pressure of specific political-economic interests,48 it
is also true that legal change is centred on the “contestability” of deci-
sion-making processes, where contestable means that there are no ma-
jor barriers to change.49

  In this changed epistemological horizon, the theory of legal change
is called on to explore the subjective micro-dimension, on a dual level:
on the one hand, individuals and, on the other, the collective. The key
notion advanced to explore this micro-dimension, proposed by Michele
Graziadei, inspired by psychological studies of the social formation of
the mind,50 is that of “mediated action”. Mediated action denotes action
performed by people through the instrumentality of material objects
and other kinds of artifacts, such as mnemonic techniques, algebraic
symbol systems, works of art, writing, schemes, diagrams, maps, me-
chanical drawings, all sorts of conventional signs, and so on.51

  This brings us to the question of languages, laws, and their design.
Drawing on the intuition that languages are social tools, the approach
we embrace provides the theoretical bases for understanding how le-
gal change processes occur in “places of engagement”, where discourse

turns into action,52 starting from schools and universities, where empha-
sis can be placed on the importance of graphic communication design
in creating not only visual communication, but also in changing people’s
attitudes and capabilities.53

  The reflection on words, terminologies, and “language” in general is
a fruitful and common starting point for the dialogue between law and
graphic communication design. In both areas, a tacit or mute dimen-
sion54 is admitted and represents much of what lies beneath the sur-
face. There are many silent rules, with people often knowing how to put
them into practice, but without being able to formulate them. However,
knowing “how to do” something is different from knowing “what to do”,
just as “knowing that” is distinct from “knowing how”55—a fact and an
awareness that are ultimately shared by both law and design. Knowing
what is the law is not only about the content of detailed legal rules and
the structures and concepts used by doctrine and legal actors, but also
about implicit sources, foundational principles and values underpinning
them; it is just as important as knowing how to go beyond written texts
or spoken words in legal communication, including images, rituals, feel-
ings and public performances as modes of human ruling and interpreta-
tion, 56 since legal texts imply more than they say.

  Continuing along this line of reasoning, it seems worth emphasising
that law and graphic communication design studies share the reflection

56 The reflection on law & language covers a vast spectrum, from the absence of

     written forms to the multiplicity of representations forms: for instance, the perfor-
     mance of an act, or of a duty, acquiescence, or exercise of a right can be implied
     by silent, normative, rules: see Sacco 1995, 2015 (n 25); pictures and images have
     a normativity in themselves: see Anne Wagner and Richard Sherwin (eds), Law,
     Culture and Visual Studies (Springer 2014); Volker Boehme-Neßler, Pictorial Law.

on the relationship between alphabetical writing and visual codes in the
formulation and communication of complex messages.57 While recog-
nising the dominance of verbal language in human communication, at
least in our cultural context, both law and graphic communication design
specifically acknowledge that not all writing is alphabetical (such as in
China) and that not all writing is verbally oriented (such as the graphic
symbols used to represent numbers).

  The fact that all writing is a set of conventional graphic signs used to
represent, preserve, and transmit information by organising language in
physical and digital space58 is another relevant aspect for a promising
dialogue between law and design.

  Furthermore, transformative processes are completed through ideol-
ogies, which are tools that legitimise normativity.59 Ideologies are forms
of action aimed at orienting social beliefs, responding to the need to
build consensus, or resistance, towards legal change. It is in the nature
of ideology, given that its adherents will act in largely the same way in
similar situations, to facilitate the carrying out of joint tasks and contrib-
ute to group cohesion. In this sense, an ideology is essentially an “inter-
face” between individual practice and collective action,60 and interface
is another key word that can unite jurists and designers in contempo-
rary thinking, on which design studies can project their theoretical and
practical knowledge. Ideology has primarily been studied as a tool of

domination, or as an expression of benevolent paternalism—and both,
at certain times and under certain conditions, have been interpreted as
the realisation of ideals of justice.61 However, ideologies are above all
ambiguous and contradictory, and they have a finite temporal horizon.
They change over time, adapt to the context, and tolerate multiple per-
sonal affiliations and subtle variations in personal commitments; they
are forced to make continuous adjustments to accommodate what lives
on the margins, the singularities that animate the collective. As a circu-
lar process, it is the behaviour of the individuals that determines that
of the entire system, and obtaining the desired behaviour depends on
individual incentives and the individual framing of information.62 At the
same time, the behaviour of the system is deduced from that of the col-
lective. Thus rebound and other second-order effects, which refer to be-
havioural or other systemic responses after the implementation of new
laws, are important as well for legal change.63 The expected effects are
not equivalent to an engineering estimate, because of systemic and be-
havioural adjustments; habits and lifestyles are also factors that lead to
the mitigation or, more frequently, amplification of the rebound effect.
If we accept the shortcomings of a positivistic research paradigm, then
there is room to understand the indirect and society-wide rebound ef-
fects from a qualitative and theoretical perspective.

  Our micro-dimension starting point is therefore a stimulus for inves-
tigating legal change from the perspective of the well-being of the fi-
nal recipients of the normative message, of different subjectivities and
their positions in respect to the collective. But that is not all. What drives

63 It is worth noting that the literature regarding the rebound effect does not dis-
     tinguish between policy-driven rebound and “autonomous” rebound. It suggests
     that rebound effects are plural because a number of mechanisms are involved:

us to adopt this analytical and subjective perspective is the recognition
that the so-called Fourth Revolution,64 based on information and com-
munication technologies (ICT), has changed our understanding of the
world in the Internet and social media age, highlighting our nature as
“permanently interconnected informational organisms”.65 This nature of
ours is shared with both other biological organisms and artificial agents
(A.I.) within an ecosystem of information and message communication.66
Breaking free from human exclusivity in law and approaching a post-an-
thropocentric legality is an ontological turn that we can accomplish with
legal design.67 The more the ICT-dependency of contemporary societies
consolidates, the more important it becomes to delve into the issue of
regulatory profiles of digital technologies and the more important the
role played by post-human-centred design becomes in designing the ob-
jects and environments in which we live, interact, and socialise,68 espe-
cially considering the fact that we have all become “infomaniacs” and
“phono sapiens”.69

legal change from analyses based on backward-looking reference sys-

legal change led by collective practices and individual actions based on
speculative design and storytelling as tools for legal and policy change:
what we have named forward-looking reference systems.

  Engaging with design is only a recent topic of interest for jurists and
lawyers,71 in which design is generally treated as a skill that can be picked
up along the way, while the true experts in the room remain the jurists.
This has much to do with the mythical “lawyers’ mindset”72 that would
appear to be an insurmountable hurdle to the empathy that is central
to design—a mindset in which a jurist’s value is determined by their as-
sumed knowledge, made up of words and by the manipulation of words,
where failure must be avoided at all costs, the group of experts must
contain the least possible cognitive diversity, creating a situation of ho-
mophily, and the problem-solver is the leading role they can play.73 Be-
low, we will capture the opposite dynamic, when designers engage with
law, and in which design is applied to a legal context, to achieve that
“well-being of law as a practical idea”, a duty that we all have, as Roger
Cotterrell suggests74—what we might call service design, or systemic de-
sign (we will not linger here on the issues that certain taxonomies raise).
By relating the story of some practices carried out at our university, we
would like to stress the naivety of the assumption that a jurist or a law-
yer can turn their hand to being a service designer, or a graphic commu-

nication, or information designer. The training, aptitude, and experience
required to be skilled in design practices is relevant. The relationship
between jurists and designers ought to be mutually constructive. De-
sign methods draw on humanistic and technical knowledge and their
experience can break through the legacy of formal thinking,75 opening
up the legal setting to empathy, fictitious descriptions of users, visualis-
ations, peripheral information, and the experiences of others, while the
legal experience that designers require can be provided in co-design pro-
cesses, through the participation of jurists and the community at large,
and in speculative design practices. These practices76 do not run the risk
of distraction or self-indulgence: on the contrary, the vision of multiple
possible, or probable futures trains our serendipity, our ability to notice
the unexpected and make it constructive for change, our ability to de-
tect, interpret and connect accidental data or random phenomena from
the existing. Thus, in planning legal change for the benefit of society as
a whole, and for the individuals who interact under the law’s protection,
we may be able to move from where we are now to where we would like
to be.

6. Speculative Design for Legal Change in Public Services

Law and design are not knowledge for themselves, but knowledge for
action. They are social practices and poietic disciplines that can build
change in the future, starting from the observation of the present. By ex-
ploring alternative hypotheses to the question about people’s real needs
in a post-anthropocentric view that assumes a new relationship with na-
ture and for nature, they enable us to see the future possibilities for
what seems inadequate, ineffective, or unjust in the present (enabling
capacity of speculative design).

  Our hypothesis is that legal change can be successfully experimented
within the interdisciplinary space where law and design meet. Our ex-

perimental work focuses, in particular, on design strategies that specu-
late on the future and are implemented through participatory and social
interaction practices in the public services sector.77

  Public services are the sector that has attracted the most social in-
novation, involving the direct engagement of citizens.78 An exemplary
case is the UK Gov design team,79 which has had similar experiences in

few examples. In these cases, co-design activities focus on including user
needs in the actual design process of digital services.85 The degree of
community engagement varies from citizens as “co-implementers” of
services and activities formerly carried out by the government, to citi-
zens as “co-designers”, involved in designing the content and delivery
process of the services, to citizens as “initiators” of the design of specific
services.86 In general terms, some suggest using “co-production” “as an

     of government to reuse developed tools: developers, suppliers, civil servants, and

     vices using open-source architecture.

82 The Spanish Central Administration, via its Secretary General for Digital Transfor-
     mation, since the program “2017 Digital Strategy for an Intelligent Spain”, has used
     co-assessment ex-ante and ex-post evaluation for digital public services, where
     stakeholders are essential to measure the economic and social impact. A success
     case of co-assessment has been in the selection of the non-working days for noti-
     fications at the Tax Agency, based on a massive evaluation feedback from all stake-
     holders.

     includes stakeholders in order to define user needs as the basis for any kind of

umbrella concept that captures a wide variety of activities that can occur
in any phase of the public service cycle and in which state actors and
lay actors work together to produce benefits”.87 With co-production, the
commissioning of services—seen as a “core public sector task [to be] un-
dertaken by politicians and top managers”88—is generally done by state
institutions and lay actors working together. This practice of “co-commis-
sioning”, used by digital government service teams in several European
countries, is prospective in nature, in that it is oriented towards the fu-
ture (a near future) and concerned with activities that may take place at
a later (but not too far) date.

  While this is the starting point for service design for public sector, in-
volving designers at multiple levels—in user consultation, service design
labs, customer journey mapping, neighbourhood and community regen-
eration forums, ethnographic research, participatory research, and so
on to redesign, for example, the websites for health care services, public
education, and senior citizens creating opportunities for interdepend-
ent living— our experimental practices draw more on speculative design
and design fiction as disrupting, visionary, imaginative, and provocative
methods89 that can fuel active participation by multiple actors with dif-
ferent interests and have a strong impact on legal change.

  The influence of future studies on design is not new; however, interest
has been growing especially late in design schools, and it seems to ree-
merge in times of crisis, when the need to think about alternative futures
becomes pressing. Nevertheless, future-oriented research methods and
interdisciplinary studies are currently only included in curricula at the in-
itiative of individual lecturers. Interest in future studies in the field of law
instead lags behind. Although in some cases the expression “future stud-
ies and law” appears to indicate an interest in exploring critical issues in
law, emerging technologies, and society, future studies have yet to be in-

corporated into regulatory processes and legal reforms—processes that
continue to be non-speculative and non-participatory, failing to engage
people and the community in the creation, planning, and organisation of
services, which in some sectors are crucial for their well-being (such as
environment, education, infrastructure, energy, and others).

  The tertiary education system and public institutions have a respon-
sibility to identify ways of engaging design students in the design of
public services, in the knowledge that only the active engagement of
designers in new interdisciplinary contexts can ensure the development
of the public services sector. At the same time, universities have a similar
responsibility towards law students, who are called upon to abandon
their traditional isolation, uniqueness, and specialness, and participate
in non-lawyer-dominated but rather interdisciplinary design activities.
Collaboration as a mode of dialogue between jurists and designers and,
indeed, as a wider template for social and political life, is the way for-
ward:90 legal change is embedded in the collaborative framework.

7. Storytelling and Design Fiction as Tools for Legal Change

The speculative design approach does not begin with product design
but “with laws, ethics, political systems, social beliefs, values, fears, and
hopes, and how these can be translated into material expressions”.91
That enables designers co-designing with legal experts and end-users,
i.e., the people to whom the legal regulations are addressed, to antici-
pate and imagine the future and concretely represent, through various
artifacts, the implications of legal choices made in the present.92

  Design fiction is the practice of creating artifacts that are not intended
to meet market needs, but rather to stimulate public debate and re-
flection through the construction of a narrative context. These artifacts
are effectively “thinking objects”—sometimes provocative in nature, so

called provotypes—that encourage critical discourse about changing the
status quo.93 Narrative, on the other hand, is an effective tool for over-
coming resistance to legal change by using empathetic language rather
than solely informative language. As all research on human cognitive
biases has widely shown,94 an abundance of information can lead to
greater resistance, rather than to a better understanding of the context.95
This is the so-called “backfire effect,” an expression coined to denote the
apparent impossibility of rationally correcting deeply ingrained beliefs.96
By raising public awareness of specific themes, narrative media, such as
cinema and literature, have demonstrated their ability to exert a direct
influence on the orientation of government policy in the United States,
for example, in the reorganisation of the psychiatric system, in building
consensus on massive investments in space exploration, in the overhaul
and modification of the administrative-bureaucratic apparatus, and in
the reorganisation of the health care system.97

  Starting in the designer’s educational career, design fiction can com-
bine law and politics, foresight and civic participation, within a conscious
and ethical narrative framework.98 This is not a mere exercise in futur-

ology. Rather, speculative design in general can help address the short-
comings of our current understanding of how legal change takes place
and broaden our understanding of key aspects of the law.99

  One of the crucial aspects that design fiction can help clarify in the
contemporary debate is the relationship between law and power, delving
into the question of whether the law is a product of power, as Norberto
Bobbio held.100 This assertion raises questions of justice, as power—be-
ing a flexible concept, understood as the authority to act for personal
or collective purposes, either through orders or through freedom—of-
fers only to those who hold it “a large space for the self”.101 Conversely,
the space for social participation is very limited. Whenever we lack the
right to participate on an equal footing, justice is called into question.
Including the needs of the individuals and collective through speculation
on the future in the actual process of designing public services and in
the regulations that govern them is a step towards an effective right to
participate. Furthermore, speculative design helps to develop tools that
are applicable to public policies and regulations, placing the necessary
emphasis on ethical concerns, as it has a counterfactual dimension and
provokes us to imagine a different reality from the one we are immersed
in, exploring it with awareness using scientific, technological, political,
and social knowledge to represent desirable futures.

  As argued in the previous Sections, our reflections offer a particularly
stimulating opportunity to critically engage in a discourse—in the spirit
of speculative design and storytelling—on legal change from a perspec-
tive of sustainability and equity.

  The complexity of the implications of such speculation can be ad-
dressed by drawing on interdisciplinary skills.

  Legal design is one such example,102 with the potential it has to change
and improve the status quo in the legal domain by using critical discur-
sive and fictional tools and exploring alternative regulatory approaches.

  Policy design is another example, as the dynamics of legal change
make it clear that the law is closely linked to politics. Hence, with the
general term policy design, we describe the action of defining the goals
of policies and the interdisciplinary design tools necessary to achieve
them.103

  Often the definition of a public policy constitutes a “wicked problem”,104
one of those problems whose cause can derive from bureaucratic, nor-
mative, technological, organisational constraints, or from political con-
ditions or a combination of all of these. In such cases, the solution to a
single problem, isolated from an overall vision, fatally risks exacerbating
the criticalities, rather than contributing to their resolution.

  The characteristics of a systemic design, which places relationships
and their sustainability at the centre, can therefore be particularly useful
in policy and legal design. The goals can be of various types: to modify
the policy-making practices, to allow the necessary institutional change,

102 Here we do not enter the discussion of whether legal design is or should be seen as
     a distinct discipline within design and/or law, or a post-disciplinary movement, or a
     nomadic practice, or a broad array of practices and studies: for a summary Ducato
     and Strowel (n 71), Allbon and Perry-Kessaris (n 98), Jackson and others (n 71),
     Santuber and Krawietz (n 32). See also Phoebe Walton, ‘James v Birnmann: The po-
     tential of critical design for examining legal issues’ in Lockton, Lenzi, Hekkert, Oak,

104 According to the definition by Horts Rittel, a mathematician, designer, and former
     teacher at the Hochschule fur Gestaltung (HfG) Ulm: “wicked problems are a class
     of social system problems which are ill-formulated, where the information is con-
     fusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with conflicting values,
     and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing”. This
     approach suggests that there is a fundamental indeterminacy (in the sense that
     there are no definitive conditions or limits to design problem) in all but the most
     trivial design problems. See Richard Buchanan, ‘Wicked Problems in Design Think-
     ing’ (1992) 8 Design Issues 5, 15-16.

or to build the capacity to co-design and implement systemic strategies
that can lead to potentially transformative policies and actions; and
the methods can be of diverse inspiration too: for example, the Polak
Game, where persons are asked to indicate their position with respect
to the experience of change (things are getting better/worse) and their
own contribution to change (I can do little/I can do a lot),105 the Futures
Wheel, a visual representation in which future repercussions are hypoth-
esised in various categories of thought—social, economic, philosophical,
religious, health, legal, ethical, and environmental,106 the Futures Cone,
with the representation of the alternatives of probable, plausible or pos-
sible futures among which to identify, by untangling the contingencies
represented by the wild cards, the preferable future,107 and the reverse
archaeology of the game The Thing from the Future, where participants
create a story from a set of random premises—temporal location, trend,
reference context, object type, and state of mind.108

  Instead of limiting ourselves to thinking about concrete answers and
solutions in terms of legal change or transformative policies, what is
even more interesting is that speculative design emphasises the impli-
cations rather than the applications; this means that it entrusts design-
ers—and their expertise drawing from different disciplines—with the
task of asking the right questions and no longer providing only answers
as problem-solvers. From this perspective, speculative design can make
a significant contribution to the formation of aware, informed, and em-
powered “citizens” (above Section 3) capable of rising to the challenges
of our present (design as world making).109

New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  57

  The use of narrative fiction does not compromise the concreteness of
co-designing legal change. This is evident if one considers the extent to
which imaginary scenarios are fundamental for the construction of the
social system. Narrative is indeed at the core of our ability to organise
extended and remote collaborative networks. The search for alternative
and ethically sustainable futures cannot, therefore, avoid questioning
the dominant narrative. Design fiction thus has the unique potential to
tackle the structural problems of our society, creating narratives of pos-
sible futures that help us question the reasons for the present. As said,
the goal of design fiction is to focus on a plurality of futures—probable,
plausible, and possible110—so as to steer reality towards those consid-
ered preferable, but in the awareness that the future, like any chaotic
system, contains all those forms of discontinuity and variability (“wild-
cards”) that, far from the classical deterministic view, make it unpredict-
able and not predetermined. Design fiction is also a tool for innovating
social practices because it presupposes broad participation in those
practices. Ultimately, this relationship between law, politics, and design
is the essence of the “design hope” invoked by Tomás Maldonado: “Po-
litically speaking, the revolutionary sense of dissent is really only attain-
able through design. Dissent that rejects hope in design is nothing but a
subtle form of consent.”111

8. Working with Futures: Some Examples

At a series of design communication workshops organised as of 2016 for
masters’ students at the University of the Republic of San Marino and at
the University Iuav of Venice,112 we experimented with the potential of
storytelling and design fiction to bring students to reflect on the impli-
cations of public service design and legal change—topics generally not
present in traditional design (nor in legal) curricula. The experience led
to the development of design communication workshops at the Univer-

     in Alessandra Bosco and Silvia Gasparotto (eds), Updating Values. Perspectives on
     Design Education (Quodlibet 2020); Sinni (n 92); Pasa and Sinni (n 77).

sity Iuav of Venice in collaboration with different institutions and, for
the last two years, with the Italian Government Department for Digital
Transformation.113 In the workshops, students were encouraged to map
the ecosystems, archetypes, and touchpoints of the main public admin-
istration services such as land management, mobility, health, education,
and culture, with the aim of tackling complex projects on the future of
the public services sector, playing with heterogeneous and hybrid visual
languages. 114

  The results of the projects, some of which are illustrated below
through the synopses developed by the students themselves, can help
highlight the dual function inherent to this learning approach: on the
one hand, building a common ground between future designers and
public decision-makers; and, on the other hand, transporting the project
into a critical and sometimes antagonistic dimension. Speculative design
frees the mind from the constraints of dominant thinking and allows us
to question even those socio-economic assumptions that, like cognitive
biases, prevent us from fully grasping the real opportunities for change.
Here, in the speculative narrative’s immersive space, it seems entirely
reasonable to propose radical legal change, such as, to cite just some of
the projects developed in the workshops: the end of the consumer sys-
tem and private property through a widespread goods sharing service;
demanding the disposal of one’s biometric data upon reaching legal age;
using a highly connected IoT network to do away with the prison system
through social control (utopia or dystopia? The choice is yours); or even
the design of a direct democracy system for guiding human communities
living in the hostile Martian environment.

Synopsis: By 2030, web platforms will all be connected to each other,
becoming the place where people constantly share information and per-
sonal data. The increasingly detailed info-trail they leave of themselves
online, however, will also be increasingly difficult to erase. Simply de-
leting one’s profile will not be enough, as the information entered over
time remains recorded and available to everyone. As such, the govern-
ment will provide a service that helps citizens understand the weight of
their shared information, offering the possibility to reset the data as they
feel is appropriate. That solution will be delete.me, an application that
communicates with social networks. People will be able to manage their
online image by deciding which content to obscure and, if necessary,
restore later, or delete permanently. In addition, they will have the pos-
sibility, through 3D scanning, facial recognition, and voice and text rec-
ognition to track down content, uploaded by others, that depicts them.
Such content will automatically come under a person’s control when
60  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

they reach the age of eighteen, as they contain their image and data.
Finally, the app will provide a documentation section that explains the
steps to take to eliminate one’s online presence.

8.2. OP!

 design lab 3, led by Gianni Sinni with Irene Sgarro. Bachelor’s degree program in

     design, University Iuav of Venice, 2020/2021. Licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0

Synopsis: Year 2040. After decades of crisis, the country is finally recover-
ing. The digitisation of services and public administration, initiated at the
beginning of the 21st century, will now be a reality. OP! is an institutional
monitoring and public participatory planning application. By accessing
the service with their digital identity, people will be able to monitor pub-
lic activities and view active projects in their residential area, as well as
national projects of interest. They will be able to actively contribute to
projects with appraisals, advice, and criticism. They will also be able to
propose original projects and see them implemented with community
New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  61

support. This service will involve citizens in collective interest projects
and optimise public spending.

8.3. Independent Theater

                         2020/2021. Licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0

Synopsis: In 2050, the world is in crisis. The environment, the economy,
and the demographic crisis are pressing problems. Complexity, unpre-
dictability, risk, and technologies have taken over, creating a digitalised
society at the expense of analog-human society. The situation has cor-
roded society to the point of its disintegration. As a result, individuals
have adopted more and more anti-social and introverted behaviour, ne-
glecting the need to establish human relationships. In response to the
need to focus on human beings and protect the environment in which
they live, a participatory system will be developed, which allows people
to express their thoughts within an Independent Theater. The idea of a
62  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

social theatre service is based on the ideal of classical Greek theatre,
which socialised citizens, and is therefore educational in its purpose,
while seeking to gather people’s opinions to pursue concrete actions
based on shared ideas. The social theatre service will be based on three
values considered fundamental: concertation, as there can be no dia-
logue without others; inclusiveness, as respect and personal opinions all
deserve equal importance; and physical experience, as it is important to
meet in person to fully understand what one does.

8.4. Smart jail

chelor’s degree program in design, University Iuav of Venice, 2020/2021. Licensed

                                      under CC-BY-SA 4.0

Synopsis: In 2050, the world is made up of smart cities, real jungles of
IoT systems where there is a constant exchange of information. In this
ultra-technological environment, Smart Jail will be a new type of prison,
developed using IoT systems to monitor all the movements of people
New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  63

who have committed crimes. In 2050, the term “inmate” will no longer
be used, because Smart Jail will be designed to do away with prisons as
physical places and the concept of detention, for which people tracked
through Smart Jail will simply be known as “offenders”. The idea is to
replace prisons with a correctional environment that becomes a reha-
bilitation experience. Alongside the use of IoT systems, offenders will
be monitored through a localising wristband, equipped with hologram
technology enabling them to interact and self-organise their daily tasks
within a programme designed to stimulate socialisation and reeduca-
tion, aimed at their reintegration into society.

8.5. Oright

chelor’s degree program in design, University Iuav of Venice, 2020/2021. Licensed

                                      under CC-BY-SA 4.0

Synopsis: Year 2060. Climate troubles and the scarcity of raw materials
have led to a new awareness, enabling the sharing economy to take hold
much more than in the past, to the point that private property no longer
matters. Due to the unsustainability of the capitalist consumption mod-
64  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

el, people in 2060 will seek durable, high-quality products and services
for all their needs and lifestyle choices like never before. Artificial intelli-
gence will help people to be more aware of what is unnecessary, to know
their needs and manage their lives more wisely. Since people will no
longer have to perform and devote time to certain tasks, the time saved
can be spent on leisure or educational activities, as well as on personal
interests and hobbies. Oright will therefore operate in a post-capitalist
scenario, where the quality and circularity of products and services pre-
vails. Sharing high-quality products and services at affordable prices will
help break down the social barriers raised by ownership, in favour of a
different logic of collective utility. Oright will be designed for sharing any
material or digital good and service. Not having to own what one needs
can only be advantageous: guaranteed assistance and maintenance, sav-
ings on objects of little use, technological updates without supplements,
and flexible loans, etc.

8.6. Harmonia

Fig. 6. Harmonia. © Robert Cosmin Oanca, Anna Laura Pascon, Emiliano Rainis
and Caterina Sartorello. Communication design lab 3, led by Gianni Sinni with

                       2020/2021. Licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0
New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  65

Synopsis: Year 2100, planet Mars. Harmonia is a human settlement of
one million inhabitants on Martian territory. The planet is not yet ter-
raformed, but daily life is possible thanks to a system of pressurised
buildings and the local, self-sufficient production of resources. The gov-
ernance of Harmonia is ethical, welcoming, and human-scale. Its inhabit-
ants come from various countries on Earth, but on Mars they all become
citizens of Harmonia (and use only English as the common language).
Their motivations for joining the settlement vary—for scientific research,
humanitarian reasons, artistic inspiration, or simply adventure, but as
volunteers they are selected for their ability to contribute to the sus-
tainability and development of human society on Mars. Harmonia is a
direct democracy, in which all propose and vote on decisions collectively.
Harmonia is also a welfare state, in which everyone is a public employee,
essential goods are guaranteed for free and luxury goods can be enjoyed
through credits earned by performing activities useful to the communi-
ty. Public services in Harmonia are provided through a digital platform
that people can access via the numerous public terminals available and
via the personal devices they are each assigned. All political, economic,
and administrative life is managed through the Harmonia portal.

9. Conclusions

The future scenarios depicted by our students in their “objects of the
future” and provotypes projects can serve as inspiration for policy-mak-
ers and legal change. The common themes addressed include sociali-
sation, engagement, co-participation, training, education, and direct
democracy. This shows that legal change can be supported by design
fiction and speculative design, starting with the reform of public services
co-designed with people, as individuals and as a collective, to enhance
confidence and cooperation, and potentially reduce public spending. In-
corporating the experiences, practices, and speculative imagination of
individuals and communities into the design, planning, and implementa-
tion of public services through an outside-in approach allows the agents
of legal change to better understand how public services can be designed
to be of greatest use and benefit for individuals and communities.

  Our complex ecosystem—populated by states and markets, but also
individuals who perform social acts and by collective actions that are
66  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

conceived and actuated through verbal and nonverbal behaviours—is
constitutive of the ethical dimension of the law. The projects we have
presented, based on speculative design, storytelling, and design fiction,
focus on the ethical dimension of the law and regulatory processes.

  As said, many pressing issues of justice in the contemporary world in-
tertwine with legal change and its complex institutional and legal dimen-
sions, which include multiple perspectives that often emerge through
comparative law. The public space of the future and the common inter-
ests of citizens and society need to be filled with inclusive and accessible
services that aim to reduce social barriers through a logic of collective
utility and well-being. We believe in the power of mistakes, provocation,
speculation, and fiction in designing alternative legal changes, relying on
inclusive, participatory forms of law-making and policy-making from the
bottom up, driven by a collective civic agency that steers transformation.
To further this goal, a pedagogical turn is necessary, which involves build-
ing different educational tools for legal scholars and designers, including
teaching legal basics in design schools and incorporating provotypes, de-
sign fiction and co-design processes into legal training. This pedagogical
shift requires a radical change in the legal process as well, incorporating
co-design and speculative practices into the creation of legal rules, and
ultimately leading to a quest for justice.
