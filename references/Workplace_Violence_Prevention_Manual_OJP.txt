DEAR MISSISSIPPIANS:

This guide is designed to help prevent workplace violence by providing a profile of a potentially violent
employee and establishing a protocol for employees and m anagem ent to report inform ation to a designated
law enforcem ent officer. The guide also includes tips on how to respond during a violent event in the
workplace and where to get help afterwards.

W hile I was a district attorney, I had the unfortunate duty of having to prosecute a workplace murder and
aggravated assault. I have learned that many acts of workplace violence can be prevented, if employees and
m anagem ent know the tale-tale signs that are com m on in potentially violent em ployees and how to
confidentially report these factors to a designated law enforcem ent officer trained to intervene.

If any of the following profile factors are observed, it should be reported to a designated law enforcem ent
officer: (1) threats of violence against others or suicide; (2) numerous conflicts with custom ers, co-workers,
or supervisors; (3) intim idating or harassing behavior; (4) bringing weapons to the workplace; (5) statem ents
of approval of workplace violence; (6) statem ents indicating extrem e desperation over m arital, fam ily, or
relationship difficulties; (7) a fanatical fascination with knives, guns, explosives, or other weapons; (8) severe
depression; (9) hatred of governm ent or other groups; (10) extrem e financial hardship; (11) alcohol or drug
abuse com bined with other factors; and (12) extrem e changes in behavior.

This guide is not intended as legal advice, but it can be a useful resource for tailoring a workplace violence
prevention program to your organization. In developing your own program , you should contact a private
attorney.
I hope that we can prevent incidents of workplace violence by allowing law enforcem ent to intervene and get
help for the potentially violent employee before the situation becom es a crisis and a danger to all.
Mississippians deserve to work in an environment without fear of violence!
Thank you for your interest and commitment in making our workplaces more secure. If my office can be of
assistance, please feel free to contact us at 601-359-3680. To obtain an example of a workplace violence
program, see our website at www:ago.state.m s.us.

WHAT IS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE?


DEFINITION AND TYPES

               he United States Department of Agriculture defines workplace violence as “any act of

  Tviolence, against persons or property, threats, intimidation, harassment, or other
               inappropriate, disruptive behavior that causes fear for personal safety at the worksite.”
(7).

         The California branch of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has identified
three distinct types of workplace violence:

                                                         TYPE I involves a stranger committing a crime
                                                         against the business. This is the most common
                                                         cause of workplace homicide.

                                                         TYPE II is committed on an employee by a client,
                                                         customer, patient, or inmate. Most Type II violence
                                                         involves nonfatal assaults or verbal threats.

         TYPE III is employee-on-employee violence and is the most-common source of threats and
         assaults. (4)

EXAMPLES OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE


                  orkplace violence may range from murder to physical assaults to verbal threats.


  WVerbal threats should never be taken lightly, because they often escalate to a physical

                  confrontation.


AN EPIDEMIC


            n an average week, U.S. workplaces experience at least one homicide as a result of


  Iviolence. (11)


         1. In most cases, employee-killers demonstrated clear warning signs of their violent
                  propensities. (11).

                                                        -1­
         2. Six hundred and nine workplace homicides were recorded in 2002, representing the
                  lowest recorded by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in census history. The record
                  high was in 1994 with a total of 1,080 deaths. (9).

LEGAL LIABILITY

               mployers have a legal responsibility to take precautions to prevent workplace violence.

  EThis responsibility may arise within Mississippi under the federal Occupational Safety
               and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA), Mississippi’s Unemployment Compensation Law, or
theories of tort liability.

         First, OSHA sets forth a “general duty” of employers to provide employees with a “safe and
healthful workplace.” (14).

         Second, under unemployment compensation law, a Mississippi employee will not be able to
receive unemployment benefits where he or she has been “discharged for misconduct connected with
his work.” (15). In Hux v. MS Employment Security Commission, the Mississippi Court of Appeals
held that an episode of workplace violence amounted to “misconduct” within the meaning of the
unemployment compensation law. (22).

         Finally, tort liability claims which may arise following an incident of workplace violence
include:

         Negligent Hiring: 

         Failing to properly screen employees, resulting in the hiring of someone with a history of

         violent and criminal acts.


         Negligent Retention:
         Keeping an employee after the employer becomes aware of the employee’s unsuitability and
         then fails to act on that knowledge.

         Negligent Supervision:
         Failing to provide the necessary monitoring to ensure that employees can perform their duties
         properly.

         Negligent Entrustment:
         These principles apply in workplace violence situations where an employer is entrusting an
         employee with a tangible piece of property.

                                                        -2­
         Failure to Train:
         Failing to sufficiently create awareness of potential dangers in the workplace may be a basis
         for liability where employers have not sufficiently created awareness of potential dangers in
         the workplace.

         OSHA’s general duty to provide a safe workplace has been the basis on which these suits
have been filed, and such suits confirm the need for preventative training. Further, OSHA’s general
duty has been enlarged to include an employer’s duty to “protect employees from feasibly
preventable hazards” as seen within episodes of workplace violence. (18 at 532-33).

WHAT TRIGGERS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE?

               he workplace has become increasingly violent over the last several decades. Employees

  Tare working longer hours, with increased responsibilities in their jobs.

         This, in turn, increases employees’s stress levels. Other factors contributing to workplace
violence include:

    ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS                      CULTURAL FACTORS

. Change                            . Economic downturn in business
. Job overload                      . Availability of weapons
. Undefined job tasks               . Breakdown of family and/or community
. Downsizing                        . Media glorification of violence (2).
. Under-staffing
. Inadequate security                           PERSONAL FACTORS
. Poor hiring practices
. Failure to respond to violent     . Loss of job, raise, or promotion
                                    . Family / marital problems
         incidents                  . Money problems
. Lack of employee counseling (2).  . Drug and alcohol abuse
                                    . Stress
                                    . Domestic violence (2).

PROFILE OF A POTENTIALLY VIOLENT EMPLOYEE


      he following chart shows some indicators of potentially violent episodes as determined

Tby the United States Department of Agriculture in 2001:

         INDICATORS                                           REMEDIES

Intimidating, harassing behavior and verbal Co-worker should notify employee’s supervisor

threats                                      of observations

Brings a weapon to the workplace             Notify human resource manager, supervisor, and
                                             in the worst case, contact police

Statements indicating approval of workplace  Begin by stating that violence is never an
violence to resolve a problem                appropriate solution; the employee’s supervisor
                                             should be notified

Statements indicating desperation over       Statements should never be ignored, but they
family or financial problems                 should be reported while minimizing, as much as
                                             possible, the tendency to overact

Direct threats of harm                       Co-worker should notify employee’s supervisor
                                             of threats and supervisor should act accordingly
                                             as stated in written policy

Substance abuse                              Pro-active prevention through Drug/Alcohol
                                             testing

Extreme changes in normal behavior           Supervisor should evaluate situation and
                                             determine the potential causes in change of
                                             behavior

Numerous conflicts with customers, co­       At the first sign of conflict, co-workers should
workers, or supervisors                      report to supervisors, while a supervisor’s
                                             conflict should be reported to management (6).

WARNING SIGNS


                  A PERSONALITY TRAITS AND BEHAVIORS CHECKLIST

                    (adapted from The School Shooter: A Threat Assessment Perspective: FBI, 1999)1 (6).

1) Communicates Intent to “Fix ” Things
                  G A potentially violent person will often let others know of their “plans” to
                           correct injustices through inappropriate comments, which the speaker quickly
                           disavows as jokes. His humor may be inappropriate and biting.
                  G Often a person who is thinking of destructive behaviors or who is conflicted
                           and is seeking help, may alert others to his feelings of inadequacy and
                           victimization, and may express his thoughts or fantasies of violent behavior
                           through poems, stories, essays, songs, or drawings. He may post threats or
                           warnings on the Internet as did the perpetrators of school violence in
                           Columbine, Colorado. Teachers or employers should look for themes of
                           violence in the communications.
                  G The employee may have a fascination with guns or dangerous weapons and
                           may have a possible military history.

2) Exhibits a Low Tolerance for Frustration
                  G The employee is easily offended, insulted or injured by real or perceived
                           injustices and cannot tolerate the everyday frustrations of the workplace, e.g.,
                           exaggerated frustration with computer problems, lack of promotions, or
                           employer evaluations.

3) Has Poor Coping Skills
                  G The employee demonstrates a poor ability to cope with frustration,
                           disappointment, criticism, rejection, and responds in an immature,
                           exaggerated and inappropriate manner. The employee blames others for his
                           own failures.

4) Lacks Flexibility
                  G The employee responds poorly to change and has difficulty in expressing his
                           extreme feelings. The employee may be the “quiet” type who harbors
                           resentments.

         1The list of characteristics is not all inclusive, and a single factor in isolation may not be
conclusive as to whether an employee may be violent. The list may be used as a checklist of
warnings or a profile, when evaluating potentially violent acts of an employee.

RESPONSIBILITIES

                ombating violence in the workplace is a team effort. While employers have a legal

  Cresponsibility to promote a tranquil work environment, employees should assist their
                managers in curbing possible violent incidents.

         Employers must care about safety and provide as safe of a working environment as possible.
Employers should have preventative measures in place and deal immediately with potentially violent
situations.

                                                        -7­
BASIC EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE:


         1. Setting a policy statement that communicates to the staff that the organization will
                  not tolerate violent behavior and that all reports of episodes will be taken seriously.
                  An example of such a policy may be found in Appendix C.

         2. Informing employees of workplace violence policies and procedures.

         3. Notifying all employees of any procedures implemented for

                  assessing workplace threats and emergencies.


         4. Taking all threats seriously.

         5. Responding to potential threats and escalating

                  situations by utilizing proper resources from law

                  enforcement.


         6. Responding quickly and understanding that timely reaction is a measure that leads
                  to success.

         7. Having a designated person to whom employees should report all threats. Designated
                  safety officers should be trained on workplace violence and know whom to contact
                  at the local designated law enforcement office.

         8. Involving management in the workplace violence policy creation process. (7).

         Just as the employer must take an active role in the prevention of workplace violence, an
employee’s awareness of the potential for workplace violence is essential to its deterrence.

EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE:

         1. Understanding the organization’s written policy prohibiting workplace violence.

         2. Notifying supervisors about possible strangers in the workplace.

         3. Taking any threat, physical or verbal, seriously and reporting threatening behavior
                  directly to the designated threat assessment officer.

         4. Allowing managers or supervisors to confront an employee who presents a potential
                  threat to the organization. (7).

HOW TO PREVENT WORKPLACE VIOLENCE


          he most important, and, in the long run, least costly portion of any agency’s workplace

    Tviolence program, is a sound prevention plan. Your organization should have the
          following preventative measures in place:

    STRATEGIES TO CREATE A SAFER WORK ENVIRONMENT

1.  Start at the top. CREATE A MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT INCLUDES MANAGEMENT AND

    DESIGNATED WORKERS. Encourage employers, CEOs, to establish an environment that aids

    victims in obtaining assistance and protections. Be involved. Management should

    participate with employees in awareness training.

2. CREATE A WORKPLACE VIOLENCE POLICY. The policy should be in an employee handbook
         and should describe leave and benefits policies for victims.
         . The policy should also outline emergency procedures, name key persons to supervise
                  in case of emergencies and list contact numbers for law enforcement.
         . The policy should also address employee assistance programs as well as procedures
                  for employee termination.
         . The Workplace Policy Handbook should also include facts on domestic violence and
                  a workplace policy on domestic violence.
         . The policy should inform workers about the Family and Medical Leave Act and the
                  American with Disabilities Act, which may be applicable to the victims of workplace
                  violence.

3. ESTABLISH EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. Make information available to workers
         through a Workplace Policy Handbook. Hold annual training sessions for employees.

4.  PROVIDE MANAGERS WITH ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING IN WORKPLACE VIOLENCE.

    Establish a training program to provide supervisors with tools to recognize the profile of a

    potentially violent employee and ways to respond when an employee is a perpetrator or a

    victim of violence.

5.  EDUCATE EMPLOYEES ON ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE. Place updates on company

    website or newsletter.

6. COORDINATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. Be sure that local authorities have a copy of your
         emergency plans and a layout of the building showing entrances, exits, hallways, doors,
         windows, elevators, etc.

                                                        -9­
               WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION POLICY


. Every organization should develop a workplace violence prevention policy.
         A written policy “clearly informs employees that the policy will address
         intimidation, harassment, and other inappropriate behavior that threatens or
         frightens them; encourage[s] employees to report all incidents; inform[s]
         employees whom to call; and demonstrates management commitment to deal
         with reported incidents.” (18 at 553).

. Through a collaborative effort between individuals from each branch of the
         organization, the workplace violence prevention policy should be developed
         to include the following:

         1. Designation of a key person with whom to lodge a complaint
                  and who has the authority to act immediately;

         2. A provision addressing any activity that causes physical harm
                  or destruction to property, or that makes an employee feel
                  frightened, threatened, or worried about his or her personal
                  safety;

         3. A list or explanation of acts that would be considered as
                  workplace violence;

         4. Guidelines and protocol to follow, whether the dispute is
                  between co-workers or outside individuals whose relationship
                  with the co-worker which could cause workplace violence;

         5. A provision describing the importance of the overall
                  responsibility of employees to support the organization’s
                  effort in discouraging workplace violence by reporting all
                  incidents without fear of retaliation;

         6. A statement that the organization as a whole will actively
                  respond to any episode of potential violence;

         7. A provision that the organization will actively work together
                  to end harassing or threatening behavior within the
                  workplace; and

         8. A statement that the organization will provide assistance to
                  and will encourage any employee to respond or report
                  potentially destructive episodes. (8).

                                              - 10 ­
         Finally, it is important to note that although it is necessary for employees to understand that
violence in the workplace is not permitted, the use of “zero tolerance” language within a written
policy may result in legal liability. (5 at 29). Therefore, such terminology should be avoided if it is
likely to deter an employee from disclosing known violent behavior. (18 at 553). Further, written
policies should incorporate simple wording, rather than using complex definitions. (18 at 553).

                                    AWARENESS/TRAINING

         One of the most important aspects of any organization’s workplace violence program is
                                         training of the staff. Training is necessary for everyone employed
                                         by the organization because prevention of violence cannot be
                                         accomplished by only select people within the organization. It is
                                         a company-wide effort. Pro-active employees and supervisors are
                                         needed to effectively rid the workplace of violence.

                                                  An organization’s Employee Assistance Program,
                                         security, and human resources staff will provide resources to
                                         employees confronted with potentially violent episodes.

Measures to be taken by Employers
         All employees should have enough training and direction to recognize incidents of violent

behavior. Further, employees should have a list of phone numbers for reference during an
emergency. Each organization should provide employees with information on workplace violence
similar to the following:

         1. A copy of the organization’s workplace violence policy, giving notice to the
                  employee and a written acknowledgment by the employee of the policy;

         2. Procedures in reporting violent episodes;
         3. Methods to minimize and prevent aggressive situations;
         4. Methods to calm hostile or angry employees;
         5. Skills to resolve conflict;
         6. Guidelines as to security procedures, e.g., the location and operation of safety devices

                  such as alarm system, evacuation procedures; and
         7. Programs implemented within the organization that can help employees to manage

                  conflict, such as Employee Assistance Programs (discussed in this guide). (3).

                                                       - 11 ­
         Also, special attention should be given to the set procedures regarding general employer
training. These procedures that promote a productive workplace can also aid in the prevention of
potential violence. General training should include basic leadership training for key employees.

         All employees should be taught to address problems promptly, and managers should be given
training on personnel management. Employers do not need to have any expertise in confronting
violent behavior, but they do need to have access to professionals who will be willing to provide
assistance to the organization.

Additional Measures
         Encourage employees to report incidents in which they feel threatened for any reason by

anyone inside or outside the organization. This may be accomplished by establishing a system of
reporting violent incidents. An example of creating awareness of violence in the workplace is found
in The Louisiana Department of Justice’s Response to Domestic Violence Manual. Awareness may
be enhanced by:

         1. Placing articles about workplace violence in company newsletters; and
         2. Participating in events created to facilitate awareness of violence committed in the

                  workplace;
         3. Showing compassion towards employees who report violence;
         4. Practicing the discipline of employees without bias;
         5. Developing a general knowledge of how to handle an emergency;
         6. Providing pre-employment screening; and,
         7. Understanding the skills required to effectively manage conflict. (3).

                               PRE-EMPLOYMENT SCREENING

         Pre-employment screening of employees is a useful method in the deterrence of violence
from the workplace. If the employer is seeking to hire a person for a position responsible for “safety,
security, client or patient care, fiscal integrity and other ‘critical’ functions, employers will likely
want to inquire into the criminal history” of the prospective employee. (18 at 548).

         Further, Mississippi statutory authority mandates pre-employment screening before an
individual is hired as an employee of a particular organization. For example, under § 25-53-51,
Miss. Code Ann. 1972, as amended, “The Mississippi Department of Information Technology
Services is required to fingerprint and conduct criminal background checks on candidates who apply
for positions of ‘information confidentiality’.” (18 at 548).

                                                       - 12 ­
         Prior to any inquiry into the person’s past history, obtain a written release form.

         An employer’s screening program should focus on the following:

         1. Look for “suspicious” intervals within employment history;
         2. Inquire into the individual’s reason for leaving previous employment;
         3. Obtain referrals to affirm the individual’s claim as to past employment and

                  education;
         4. Include in the referral “performance, disciplinary history, and always ask a former

                  employer if he would consider the individual for rehire?" (18 at 548).

                                   SECURITY

                  aintaining a safe work place is part of any good prevention


  Mprogram. There are a variety of ways to help ensure safety, such

                  as employee photo identification badges, guard services, and

individually coded key cards for access to buildings and grounds. Different
measures may be appropriate for different locations and work settings. (7).
Security identification should be confiscated by the organization upon the
termination or voluntary resignation of an employee to ensure continuing safety
of present employees.

         Security may also be monitored by requiring employees to complete surveys periodically.
Such assessment allows management to focus on particular areas of concern by identifying a
potentially violent situation prior to the occurrence of a homicide within the workplace. (5).

                       ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR)

                lternative Dispute Resolution is a form of conflict resolution that is completed between

  Atwo parties with the assistance of a “neutral third party.” Disputes submitted for ADR
                are not the subject of traditional litigation; therefore, ADR is by definition less
confrontational. “ADR can help prevent the escalation of conflict into violent or potentially violent
situations. The key is using ADR early, before emotions or conduct make discussion a non-option.”
(7).

                                     THREAT ASSESSMENT

               hreat assessment is the process of determining the magnitude of a potentially violent

  Tor stressful situation and providing a means of intervention to diffuse the situation. Due
               to the uncertainty of whether a violent episode will take place, the organization should
always treat threats in a serious manner and act as if the person is likely to carry out the threat.

         First, assess the credibility of a threat, and, second, evaluate the disposition of the person
making the threats. This process allows an informed judgment to be made as to whether the person
articulating the threats is likely to carry out a violent act or homicide and whether the threat is
immediate and the act is imminent. Threat assessment also helps the employer decide how to
effectively handle the situation so that violence does not occur.

Good threat assessment will analyze:
         1. The exact nature and context of the threat and/or threatening behavior;
         2. The identified target (general or specific);
         3. The threatener’s apparent motivation intent to carry out threat;
         4. The threatener’s ability to carry out the threat;
         5. The appropriate intervention that will help the thretener and protect victims; and,
         6. The threatener’s background, including work history, criminal record, mental health,
                  history, military history, and past behavior on the job. (6).

A secondary goal is to determine the credibility level of the threat.

       LEVEL I: The threatener has the means, ability, and intent to carry through with

         the issued threat. (Requires immediate law enforcement intervention)

       LEVEL II: While the threatener subject may possess the means, he does not

         possess the ability or intent to carry out the threat. (May require social services, and
         workplace based intervention by designated employee the employer)

       LEVEL III: The threatener does not possess the means, ability or intent to carry

         out the threat. (Usually requires only employer based and possible social services
         intervention or help of Employee Assistance Programs).

                                                       - 14 ­
         Organizations vary in type and size; therefore, each will need to develop its own plan and
implementation procedures for threat assessment to meet its individual needs by the resources
available to that particular organization. Nationally based companies may utilize the necessary
expertise from their own security, medical, human resources, legal, and employee assistance
departments. Local organizations may have to seek outside help from police or human services
departments. Once threat assessment groups are established, they should be periodically maintained
and updated so employers have accurate information if assistance is necessary.

         Every workplace violence prevention program should designate the personnel who will be
specifically responsible for overseeing the organization’s anti-violence policy, including threat
assessment and crisis management. Teams should have the authority, training, and support needed
to meet their responsibilities. Further, it is often helpful to provide employees with a hierarchy of
people within the organization to whom they may confidentially report a violent incident, such as
the following example:

       ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY FOR REPORTING WORKPLACE VIOLENCE

Level One    Supervisor/Manager
Level Two    Human Resources Staff
Level Three  Employee Assistance Programs

         Designation of a “coordinator” to oversee threat assessment teams is essential. This
“coordinator” will have the responsibility of determining the proper response in an emergency
situation. (6). The threat assessment teams will be responsible for referring all reports of violence,
threats, and harassment, or conduct that may frighten any employee to the threat assessment
coordinator. (6). Threat assessment team members do not have to conduct threat assessments alone,
but may contact an outside threat assessment professional to support the team. (5).

         These teams include, “experienced, knowledgeable [members] that could review threats,
consult with outside experts, and provide recommendations and advice to the coordinator and other
[employees].” (6 at 25). Some examples of people who make up a multi-disciplinary team include
police officers, psychologists, social workers, and medical personnel. The teams should interview
the treatener's peers, associates, and superiors regarding the threatener's character performance and
personality.

             - 15 ­
         Once a threat has been assessed for its severity, the proper response may be taken. For
example, in its workplace violence manual, the state of Hawaii has determined that if the risk is
“high” and the danger level is also "high", the proper response should be “arrest or hospitalization.”
(8). On the other hand, a “low” level of risk and danger may lead to supervision of the person making
threats. (5).

         Mississippians have the opportunity to form threat assessment skills through the Department
of Education. This Department has established Threat Assessment Protocol Workshops that are
presently available for enrollment across Mississippi. (13). These workshops are tailored to fit the
safety needs of Mississippi’s grade schools, but the protocol for threat assessment taught may be
implemented to address the needs of any organization.

                                             EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

                                                        f your organization has the resources, consider an

               IEmployee Assistance Program (EAP). This is an
                                                        effective program that establishes a confidential
                                                    support service with trained counselors who are enabled
                                                     with the proper resources to work through work-place
                                                     violence issues. These advisors may be used to assess
                                                    whether a situation needs to be brought to the attention
                                     of management. They may also be a useful means of generating
positive ideas to handle issues of workplace violence. (7). Mississippi businesses have most often
implemented EAP’s within “drug and alcohol prevention policies.” (18 at 552).

         EAP’s give employees access to professionals who are available to discuss problems that can
adversely affect job performance and conduct. (7). “Employee ‘life’ problems like alcoholism,
emotional difficulties, family conflict, substance abuse, legal and financial difficulties and the like
take a tremendous toll on the employee’s ability to function at work. As an employee loses a sense
of control over his or her environment, workplace manifestations may follow.” (18 at 552).

         In addition, employees who seek such program’s services are protected with “considerable
privacy by laws, policies, and professional ethics maintained by EAP providers.” Normally, the
coordinator of the EAP notifies employees in writing about the limits of confidentiality upon the
employee’s interest in using the program. (7).

   DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING


S  ubstance abuse creates a host of problems for an individual both personally and

   professionally. In the workplace, an employee who abuses alcohol and drugs

   poses a greater risk to the organization; therefore, testing reduces such risk.

   Prior to instituting a testing program employers should ensure that a

   written policy is in place that satisfies state law; select a date for testing

   (prior to hiring, once an employee gains a new title within the

   organization, at random, or for “reasonable suspicion”); and, utilize a

   proper testing facility in accordance with state law. (18 at 547).

         Under § 71-7-5 of Miss. Code Ann. 1972, as amended, employers have the right to engage
in testing for substance abuse in the following situations:

1. An employer may require a person seeking employment to undergo a drug and
         alcohol test prior to obtaining employment. If the individual refuses to take the test
         or the results are positive indicating the presence of drugs or alcohol in an
         individual’s system, a valid reason exists for refusing to employ the individual.(16).

2. "An employer may require all employees to submit to reasonable suspicion drug and
         alcohol testing.” If the individual tests positive for drugs or alcohol in a
         “confirmatory” test, the law presumes that the employer had reasonable suspicion to
         test for alcohol or drugs. (16).

3. An employer may require all employees to undergo neutral selection drug and alcohol
         testing provided the requirements of § 71-7-9 of Miss. Code Ann. 1972, as amended,
         are followed. Under §71-7-9, tests must be handled safely and preserved, written
         notice must be given to the employees of positive results, and the appropriate costs
         must be assessed. (16)

         Please note: this is a brief summary of the statutory requirements of § 71-7-9. Employers
should refer to the statute specifically when implementing this method of testing.

                                TERMINATION AND DISMISSAL

               ermination or dismissal from a position of employment creates an excessive amount of

  Tstress on the dismissed employee; therefore, every effort should be taken to conduct the
               termination in a non-offensive manner. Employers may provide counseling, employee
assistance programs, or job counseling services to employees who are laid-off, dismissed, or
terminated. Another method of decreasing stress for the employee is to provide out-placement
assistance. Further, employers should consider utilizing special tactics in circumstances where a
violent episode is likely to occur. Employers may consider the following:

         • Timing should be given special attention where violence is at issue. Some dismissals
                  may need to be handled immediately, while others may be better suited for a specific
                  day of the week.

         • Maintain the employee’s self-respect. If the employer thinks that the organization is
                  susceptible to a threat, a different mode of termination should be considered
                  depending upon the risk of threat.

         • Dismissal should be a statement of fact, rather than subject to discussion with the
                  employee.

RESPONDING TO VIOLENT INCIDENTS

                  ost organizations have procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. For

  Mexample, an evacuation plan may exist to assist employees in the case of a fire.
                  Similarly, some organizations may give their employees specific directions to follow
if a tornado should approach the surrounding locale. While these plans are certainly beneficial for
natural disasters, an emergency workplace violence plan should differ to some degree. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture has determined the following provisions should be followed after an
episode of workplace violence:

         1. Notify workplace violence coordinator;
         2. Notify medical personnel;
         3. Notify the police and/or security;
         4. Implement escape procedures;
         5. Establish safe havens both internally and externally;
         6. Secure the workplace where the violence occurred;
         7. Ensure that all employees have safely evacuated;

                                                       - 18 ­
         8. Notify individuals who are able to perform medical/rescue assistance;
         9. Instruct employees in workplace violence issues annually;
         10. Consistently evaluate and revise the plan; and,
         11. Provide employees with the necessary instruction/assistance after the violence ends.

                  (7).

         As an additional security measure, the organization should ensure that the emergency
workplace violence plan is filed with local law enforcement prior to its implementation.

         No matter how effective policies and plans are in detecting and preventing incidents, there
are no guarantees against workplace violence. Even the most responsive employers face this issue.
When a violent incident does occur, it is essential the response be timely, appropriate in situation,
and carried out with the recognition that employees are traumatized, and the incident’s aftermath has
just begun.

         Every office should distribute to each employee an emergency plan outlining procedures to
follow in the event of fire, bomb threats, and threats of violence both internal and external to the
organization. Emergency numbers should be posted. Wallet cards can be distributed to employees.

         In the event of an emergency, refer to the phone numbers of security, police, and medical
service in your organization’s emergency plan.

         For handy reference, you may wish to write down the numbers of emergency services in your
area in the portion provided on the back page of this guide.

                                EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM

                n emergency response team begins its involvement in an episode of

  Aworkplace violence once an occurrence has taken place. The
                goal of the emergency response team is to confront the
actual violent episode and its aftermath and to initiate
preventative measures to ensure that further workplace violence
does not continue to occur. (7). A representative of the response
team should be ready to answer questions by the media and inform
the public should the episode be of great magnitude.

         The Emergency Response Team acts together to implement the organization’s workplace
violence policy and to create a method of managing post-termination procedures. (7).

                                                       - 19 ­
                               POST TERMINATION PROTOCOL

                fter an episode of violence has taken place, the organization must immediately begin

  A“investigations, victim assistance, preventive and corrective actions, coordination with
                the media, and address administrative issues.” (7). Further, managers, supervisors, or
the emergency response team should carry out certain activities including the following:

         G Report the violence to the police;
         G Provide medical assistance to victims if necessary;
         G Conduct a roll call of employees;
         G Assess damage by using the organization’s workplace violence program;
         G Check for safety hazards;
         G Photograph and document damage;
         G Initiate salvage operations;
         G Carry out the crisis response plan in the organization’s workplace violence program;

                  and,
         G Provide psychological counseling to victims. (1).

         Even if these steps are followed, employees usually are vulnerable to "crisis reactions" which
include:

         Stage One – “The employee experiences emotional reactions characterized by shock,
         disbelief, numbness, and denial. Physically, the employee experiences shock or a fight-or­
         flight survival reaction in which the heart rate increases, perceptual sense become heightened
         or distorted, and adrenaline levels increase to meet a real or perceived threat.” (7 at 13).
         Stage Two – Represents “the ‘impact’ stage where the employee may feel a variety of intense
         emotion, including anger, rage, fear, terror, grief, sorrow, confusion, helplessness, guilt,
         depression, or withdrawal. This stage may last a few days, a few weeks, or a few months.”
         (7 at 13).
         Stage Three – Represents “ the ‘reconciliation’ stage in which the employee tries to make
         sense out of the event, understand its impact, and through trial and error, reach closure of the
         event so it does not interfere with his or her ability to function and grow. This stage may be
         a long-term process.” (7 at 13).

         Within each of the three stages, employees may have different reactions. The depth of
reaction is determined by the presence or absence of the following factors: “the duration of the
event, the amount of terror or horror the victim experienced, the sense of personal control (or lack
thereof) the employee had during the incident, and the amount of injury or loss the victim

                                                       - 20 ­
experienced.” (7 at 13).

         To aid in recovery, employers should offer stress debriefing sessions and post-traumatic
counseling services. Additionally, many state and non-profit agencies are willing to provide
assistance to the families of the victim’s of workplace violence. In a handbook entitled,
Mississippi...and Justice for All: A Victim’s Guide, Mississippi has compiled a listing of those
agencies through the Office of the Attorney General's Crime Prevention & Victim Services. Topics
include the following:

G Children;                       G Survivors of Homicide;
G Domestic Violence;              G Sexual Assault;
G Elderly;                        G State Agencies; and
G Mothers Against Drunk           G Victim Assistance

  Thandbook. (8). The purpose of this checklist is to

provide a means of obtaining accurate, first-hand
information of the details of a threat as it is occurring.

         Obviously, all callers will not intend to threaten your
organization; therefore, it may be beneficial to state an apology prior to asking
more intrusive questions in an effort to ease the mind of the incoming caller. It is also important to
be respectful of the caller. Always address the caller as “Sir” or “M’aam” in a soft tone of voice.

         After a checklist has been completed, please send it to the person designated to handle
workplace violence matters within your organization.

SAMPLE WORKPLACE VIOLENCE POLICY (19)


   To All Employees Of (name of organization):
            This is a statement by (name of organization) written in an effort to diminish crime

   within the workplace. Each of you should understand that (name of organization) is
   committed to a safe and healthful workplace; therefore, workplace violence will not be
   tolerated within (name of organization). Also, it is important for each employee to
   understand that the threat of workplace violence is a reality; no organization is immune.

            For your understanding, the United States Department of Agriculture defines
   workplace violence as “any act of violence, against persons or property, threats,
   intimidation, harassment, or other inappropriate, disruptive behavior that causes fear for
   personal safety at the worksite.” Any report whatsoever of the above behavior will be
   subject to assessment by (name of organization).The penalty for any form of workplace
   violence may include, but is not limited to, the following: increased supervision, counseling,
   removal from the premises of (name of the organization), termination, and/or criminal
   liability.

            In order to implement an effective workplace violence policy, we must all actively
   work together. Our goal is to provide security for each employee within their work
   environment. Therefore, if any of you witness behavior that fits the above description of
   workplace violence, whether the act is done by a co-worker or a person with whom you are
   not acquainted, please report such behavior to your immediate supervisor. Any reports
   should then be forwarded to (the appropriate named agency).

            Please review the contents of this workplace violence handbook for more specific
   clarification, or you may contact your supervisor. Please note: if an individual is subject to
   an immediate threat, contact security at xxx-xxxx or dial 91l for assistance. Thank you all
   for your service to (name of organization).

                                                         Sincerely,
                                                         (CEO, President, Chief of Staff, etc.)
