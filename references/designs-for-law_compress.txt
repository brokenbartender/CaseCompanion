PREFACE

The Editors

Legal design has been with us for over a decade. Its core idea, i.e. to use
design methods to make the world of law accessible to all, blossomed
at the beginning of the 2010s in what can be considered its two main
‘cribs’: the Legal Design Lab in Stanford, directed by Margaret Hagan,
and the Finnish environment, fuelled by thinkers like Helena Haapio, Ste-
fania Passera, or initiatives like the Legal Design Summit.

  Since then, legal design has been embraced by academics, researchers,
and professionals almost worldwide. New initiatives, courses, projects,
and publications (including a dedicated academic journal)1 are emerging
at a constant pace, showing that such a practice is more than just hype.

  The reflection about what we mean by legal design, which design
practices are key to the legal field, what we can do with them, whether
they work and how to evaluate their outcomes, and what the values of
the community of ‘legal designers’ are, has been going on. The constant
questioning about its impact and value is probably the reason for this
discipline’s healthy and steady growth.

  This book can be inserted in the continuum of such collective reflec-
tion. It starts from the observation that legal design has entered an age
of adolescence. One of the predominant approaches has been the ‘de-
sign thinking’ method and its problem-solving orientation. However, the
awareness that this framework does not exhaust the spectrum of legal
design practices has grown over the years, and the palette of tools and
applications available to everyone has become more diverse and colour-
ful.

  The volume contains twelve contributions presented at the ‘Legal
Design Roundtable’ dedicated to ‘Design(s) for Law’ and organised in
Brussels in 2023 within the Erasmus+ Jean Monnet clinic on ‘EU Digital
Rights, Law, and Design’. These perspectives from academics and profes-
sionals add important nuances to the literature, either presenting new

approaches, applying consolidated practices to new contexts and areas,
and showcasing actual and potential applications.

  The first part of the book explores the significance of speculative de-
sign for law. Speculative design has been popularised by Dunne and Raby
as a practice to critically reflect on social, cultural, and ethical issues
through future scenarios or artefacts (the ‘provotypes’, i.e. provocative
prototypes). However, it is not a sort of sci-fi exercise: it is an intellectual
effort for the present to think about where we are headed as a society
and direct our future.

  Chapter 1 opens the series with an interdisciplinary work by a com-
parative lawyer and a designer in one of the most interesting European
hubs for architects, visual artists, and designers (the IUAV University of
Venice). In their piece, Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni outline the poten-
tial of speculative design for legal change. Pasa and Sinni present a se-
lection of works created during a series of workshops with their students
that will certainly challenge the imagination of the readers and let them
think about the implications of those propositions.

  Emily MacLoud continues in this direction in Chapter 2. Building on a
series of examples, including her direct experience during the workshop
‘Experimenting with Design in Legal Education’, organised by Amanda
Perry-Kessaris and Emily Allbon in 2022, she distils some lessons learned
when applying speculative techniques in the legal domain.

  The second group of contributions deals with another set of tools that
can enrich the legal reflection: narratives and storytelling.

  In Chapter 3, Emily MacLoud critically engages with one of the most
popular instruments used in design thinking, i.e. the ‘persona’, the fic-
tional representation of the user serving as a benchmark during the
design process. Drawing from Kate Raworth’s work as an example, she
argues that the power of storytelling can contribute to developing sto-
ries and narratives to embrace (legal) complexity and inspire systemic
change.

  Hallie Jay Pope explores the role of critical play as a means to sup-
port collective and organising efforts by ‘ordinary people’ in Chapter 4.
By showing ways – such as video games – in which dominant and elite
narratives can be challenged, her vibrant piece speaks to legal designers
concerned with inequalities, imbalance of power, and oppressive sys-
tems.
Preface  23

  The third part of the book hosts works answering the call of imaging
legal design beyond the user-centred approach or re-imagining its im-
plementation.

  Chapter 5 builds on an important vein that has characterised the evo-
lution of legal design over the years: proactive law. Moving from a pre-
ventive and problem-solving dimension of design, Robert de Rooy, Anne
Ketola, and Helena Haapio present their work on Composite Comic Con-
tracts, a tool to make the contractual artefact more ‘cognitively acces-
sible’ through a combination of strategies, including visualisation. They
acknowledge the chance that the visual aspect of contracts might gener-
ate legal uncertainty, but they argue that this will not be an insurmount-
able obstacle for the tools of legal hermeneutics.

  The proactive approach to law is also at the centre of Chapter 6. Here,
Marika Salo-Lahti and Helena Haapio combine it with the framework of
possibility-driven design, intended as a method to explore possibilities
to improve people’s lives even when there is no problem to solve on
the horizon. They contextualise their proposition within the case of dis-
closure duties in sustainability legislation at the EU level, also offering
a critical take on how and to what extent some AI instruments, notably
OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can be used for presenting legal information.

  In Chapter 7, Nina Toivonen and Santiago De Francisco Vela open the
section on the role of participatory design practices in legal design. The
authors note that despite the emphasis on the ‘human element’ as the
main focus of legal design, the idea and baggage of participation struggle
to materialise in practice (what they call the ‘paradox of participation’).
In their contribution, the authors argue for such a participatory turn in
legal design and discuss five methods and tools to facilitate it.

  Santiago De Francisco Vela and Laura Guzman-Abello ideally continue
along this line of argumentation in Chapter 8, where they present the

of the project ‘Les Surligneurs’, a media outlet to fact-check the legal ac-
curacy of statements made in the press, in particular by politicians. The
initiative embedded the legal design ethos and principles, and the paper
constructively reflects on the limitations of its current understanding in
France.

  Dulcis in fundo, Marie Potel-Saville presents her ongoing work on one
of the key problems that has attracted the intervention of legislators,
notably the European one in the recent Digital Services Act: dark pat-
terns. Such deceptive and misleading design practices can harm con-
sumers who are in a situation of ontological vulnerability (as humans
are structurally affected by cognitive biases and heuristics). In her piece,
the author introduces the concept of ‘fair patterns’ as a tool to support
individuals’ decision-making processes.

  This journey through various approaches in legal design will, we hope,
be inspirational and nourish further reflections and new experimenta-
tions in integrating design into the realm of law.

1. NEW FRONTIERS OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE:
HOW DESIGN PROVOTYPES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO
LEGAL CHANGE

Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

Abstract
Legal change is a complex phenomenon. Transplants, imitations, borrowings, as-
similations by chance or for prestige, adoptions and rejections, and cross-fertil-
isation are all dynamic processes, which correspond to the past and the present
of world legal systems—and they are not just a matter of the “sovereign will” of a
state and its sovereign power. Beyond the state, supranational institutions of var-
ious kinds are the global agents responsible for shaping legal order reform. Their
actions are the preserve of a multitude of forces, including transnational epistemic
communities across the globe. What is less explored is how legal change can be
the outcome of individual and collective actions, in an age when, for the first time
in human history, social organisations depend on the use of information and com-
munication technologies (ICTs). This fact radically affects the legal sphere. How do
these collectives and individuals exercise their rights and how are they reminded
of their duties, thus playing a major role in delineating the boundaries of the re-
lationship between themselves, legal institutions, and legal change? What legal
change is implied by the empirical analysis of the social acts involved in what they
do? While legal transplantation theory explicitly deals with how legal change is
produced with reference to national and transnational legal institutions, the rec-
ognition of speculative design practice in the legal domain can raise awareness
of pressing societal issues and bolster individual and collective civic agency over
transformation and legal change, through imagination and critical thinking.

1. Legal Change: Setting the Scene and its Narratives

Legal change can be described through the agents vested with the pow-
er to change the law.

  The following are the main (simplified) narratives aimed at recon-
structing legal change from the modern era to the present day; they
constitute a minimum common ground of shared knowledge between
28  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

jurists and designers, a starting point for contributing to a critical and
speculative reflection on future scenarios about legal change.

  In Western legal tradition, the agents of legal change are judges and
lawmakers, with the former acting through case law, and the latter
through government and parliamentary legislation. Legitimised from
below, as institutions of the Rechtsstaat founded on the archetype of
the will of the people, these agents decide whether to adopt or reject
legal change, controlling it within state borders, with the aim of arriving
at new and more efficient legal solutions for fairer legislative reform.
The Western-style sovereign state therefore assumes that changes in
legal rules are the result of a complex function that is entirely internal
to its organs, in which an independent body of specialist-expert judges,
together with good legislative practice by state officials, can be steered
towards specific policy objectives, such as the recognition of human
rights, democratic values, non-discrimination principles and justice, im-
proved economic performance, greater investments and efficiency (but
also towards diametrically opposed political goals, as was the case with
the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe). It later also assumed that good rules
can be exported to countries transitioning to democracy and the market,
because most legal rules can operate in very different societies from the
one for which they were originally created through the almost surgical
operation of “legal transplants,” to use the fortunate expression coined
by Alan Watson (1974).

  This first narrative of legal change characterised the modern era until
the Second World War. It then came to overlap with a more complex
transnational narrative, which ever since the Bretton Woods agreements
has been guided by economic liberalism and legal functionalism. Private
international financial institutions and corporations regarded the World
Bank’s activities (granting of loans) as complementary to their interests:
public works projects to improve the economic infrastructure could only
be good for private foreign investors, too.

  The fundamental idea is that policy choices and legal rules have a di-
rect effect on the functioning of markets and economic growth, with
spill-over effects on sectors not directly dependent on economic mech-
anisms. In this transnational dimension,1 multiple agents steer legal

change. On these premises, over the last fifty years, the dynamics of
legal change have been based on specific alliances between states, form-
ing more or less cooperative networks that act at different speeds. Such
alliances range from the maximalist political and economic integration
model of the European Union and its Member States, to the minimalist
model of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), created in the
wake of the break-up of the Soviet Union to prevent the sudden disap-
pearance of an alliance system that for seventy years had kept the So-
viet Socialist Republics together; from purely economic cooperation for
the elimination of tariff barriers –operating on a macro or mega-regional
scale, where for macro-areas we have, for instance, the United States–
Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA, formerly NAFTA) in North-Central
America, the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and
Trade Agreement (CETA), the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in the Per-
sian Gulf, the ASEAN Free Trade Area Agreement in Southeast Asia, or
the MERCOSUR in Latin America; and for mega-areas we have, for ex-
ample, the World Trade Organization (WTO), which deals with the global
rules of trade between nations, and the Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)– to cooperation that
integrates economic aspects into a future framework of political inte-
gration, such as the Andean Community, the Union of South American
Nations (UNASUR), the African Union, the Arab League, and the Council
of Europe, to name but a few. By accommodating these transnational
dynamics, legal change is driven by a range of factors, which can be
simplified in terms of military force, political influence, and economic
power, even once colonialism had ceased. Of these three factors, im-
proving economic performance is perhaps the most visible goal in terms
of joint statements and declarations of intent; however, it is also the
least relevant for the dynamics of legal change, as what usually matters
most in these cases is not the effectiveness of legal reform, but the repu-
tation-based legitimacy acquired by joining a prestigious “club of peers”
or group of “reliable states.”

in general terms, is the law that regulates actions or events that transcend national
borders, including both public and private international law, as well as other rules
that fall outside the national source system (post-Westphalian model)’.
30  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

  Regional or international financial organisations, such as the EBRD in
Europe, the IMF, or the World Bank,2 often fund legal change processes,
but they propose a “one size fits all” approach to be implemented as
quickly as possible, with funding conditional on the adoption by recip-
ient countries of the rule of law and democratic reforms. By proposing
the adoption of economic theories and models that make the effec-
tiveness of legal change dependent on the time needed to evaluate its
effects on markets’ performances, legal systems become market-de-
pendent variables. In this functionalist paradigm, legal rules become a
tool of social engineering, a mere technique of utility in the service of
better economic performance.

  Endorsing this approach and its neo-liberalist version, other players
have joined in the global dissemination of standardised, high-perfor-
mance rules. They include not only public entities, but also private, or
public-private, organizations, foundations, associations, corporations,
professional firms, NGOs from all sectors, standardisation organisations–
such as, for example, the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO), and ICANN, a US-based non-profit corporation with global capi-
tal, which manages the domain name system–, and even big law firms,
that have an exceptional regulatory role and play an important part in
processes of legal change through contractual instruments and property
rights adjudication procedures.3

  Non-state regulatory solutions are, de facto, extremely pervasive in
the post-Westphalian environment. Tech giants, with their technologi-
cal management of the Internet, show how technology can transform
the way regulatory and legal functions are performed nowadays, in the
space that Roger Brownsword called “the Law 3.0”.4 Technology is chang-
ing both the idea of existing law as a coherent system of legal rules and
standards, and the way that lawyers, judges, and legislators think about
the law’s role, and about the national and international architecture of
legal and regulatory institutions, including whether A.I. and algorithms
could count as legitimate institutions as well.5

  Our regulatory mind-set needs then to focus on the disruption of the
fundamental assumptions on which traditional legal thinking is built, and
to take up the challenge on the monopoly concentrations of the “atten-
tion merchants”6 and their business models in terms of data access/data
protection. This is our time, the time we live in, where “code” and “ar-
chitecture” can be more important than formal laws, where IT program-
mers, computer scientists and neuroscientist teams have a greater effect
on a risk management approach to law than the legislators. It is, indeed,
the “architecture” that Lawrence Lessig, in his seminal essay, called
“code” 7 that plays the most important role today, in the digital ecosys-
tem in which not only markets, but also our social relations have been
moving for some time. The Internet is more subject to non-state forms
of control than the offline world.8 And it could not be otherwise. The
Internet is (for now) entirely human-made, and it is online that “code” is
the most powerful lever for shaping and regulating our behaviours.

  These continuous transformations of the normative dimension have
led political and economic uncertainty to grow worldwide.

  In such a complex framework, agents of legal change also seek to
measure the effects of their reforms and understand whether time is
still an essential factor for reforms to take root—as it was in the past,
when the control and steering of legal change was firmly in the hands
of the state, and local epistemic communities9 could be swayed to
construct a consensus for a reform. But the quantitative analyses, and
the Law and Finance theory as initiated by La Porta, Lopez-de Silanes,
Shleifer, and Vishny10 appear to be backward-looking reference systems
of knowledge, based on “historical evidence”–as they investigated the
differences between legal origins and their impact on economic perfor-
mance–especially when compared to new ways of understanding com-
plex phenomena, as will be discussed in the following pages.

  What has been said so far also applies to non-Western legal traditions,
although the main drivers for legal change were, and are, other things:
mainly the ideology of the group or party in power, tradition, religion,
chance, and even personal factors. This can be seen in the legal systems
of the Islamic world, the Indian subcontinent, Far East Asia and in sub-Sa-
haran African traditions, where legal change has coincided with the his-
tory of colonisation, coups d’état, and non-pacific revolutions, and with
the international trade routes marked out by the pressures of interest
groups and personal contacts.11 But when looking at non-Western con-
texts, what matters above all is “the process” of legal change; a process
that unfolds shaped by both the supply side of the reforms, which is
generally indifferent to or unaware of the framework in which new legal
rules will be received, and the demand side, which often does not un-
derstand or is indifferent to the specific content of the new legal rules

     level and are dependent on privileges granted by the state see Brook Harrington

(examples of content include redistributive effects, the degree of com-
patibility with pre-existing legal rules in the system, the time required
for adaptation to the local hermeneutic tradition, etc.). The supply/de-
mand division reflects the tension between the legal change and the
framework for its reception—a tension that is more significant where
countries are less homogeneous than, for example, EU Member States
following their European political and economic integration. Thus, at the
root of legal change processes we find a lack of understanding, a net-
work of informational asymmetries, and fallacious simplifications that
are of little help in grasping the various facets of legal change, in particu-
lar of legal transplants shaped by religious factors, personal interests,
chance and prestige.12

  In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and the fears and negative
effects associated with the transnational dynamics of Covid-19, Western
and Global North institutions are fully aware of how legal changes are
complex and non-linear multifactor processes, with no clear boundaries
between what is local (nationalism) and what is global (transnational-
ism/supranationalism).13 Instead they are mutually constitutive dynam-
ics, in which local and global construct each other, becoming “glocal”.
Local customs, practices, and traditions are real elements of all legal sys-
tems, not a cultural invention in response to the neoliberal international
legal order. 14

  What we are therefore experiencing today on a global level is the con-
tradictory coexistence of very different regulatory systems: on the one
hand, customary rules, practices, and traditions that are the effective
components of all legal systems; and on the other, the architecture of
the Internet, and coding techniques, which are equally real elements of

contemporary legal systems. As such, they raise issues of justice, respon-
sibility, sustainability, and solidarity.

2. Legal Change: The Good Practice of Interdisciplinary Research in
Comparative Law

Comparative law, like other domains of study, looks at legal knowledge
from an interdisciplinary point of view. Legal knowledge has porous
boundaries and fault lines. By displaying overarching patterns of differ-
ence and similarity, comparative law has, for some time now, opened
the “black box” of law, revealing its many dimensions and pushing for an
examination of the actual and potential possibilities available when legal
change is necessary or desired.

  The consolidation of interdisciplinary approaches has led comparative
law to tap into a composite and collective knowledge that is methodo-
logically robust and, at the same time, flexible and not self-referential.
After all, stateless issues such as global warming, environmental destruc-
tion, social injustice, poverty, natural disasters, and pandemics are not
inevitable events, or the result of historical determinism, and can only
be addressed by bringing together different disciplines, practising in-
terdisciplinarity, and pursuing wide-scale participatory action—without
which the well-known goals of the UN 2030 Agenda, “a plan of action for
people, planet and prosperity”, as it states in its preamble,15 will remain
a dead letter.

  Interdisciplinary inquiry, for instance, has brought to light the deep
malaise in Western legal and political thought based on the values of civ-
ilised nations.16 The dualistic tendency it shows of identifying bad local
rules based on tradition, implying they are synonymous with backward-
ness, and good global norms of a universal, cosmopolitan, and rational
nature, based on the supposed existence of a natural law (for which one
is against landmines/for the protection of dolphins, against racism/for
equal gender rights, against genocide/for human rights, etc.) has been

15 See <https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda> accessed 12 January 2023.
16 The charter of the International Court of Justice is also based on these principles:

     (1922–2018) (Brill Nijhoff 2020).
New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  35

widely commented on and criticised as a functionalist approach to legal
change based on the so-called “Washington consensus,” leading to the
“Americanisation” of the world17—although the same can be said today
about Europe and the so-called “Brussels effect” beyond European bor-
ders.18

  Interdisciplinary inquiry, furthermore, has provided an alternative ex-
planation in response to the observation that many rules that have been
imitated or transplanted have remained on paper and have not always
produced the legal uniformity hoped for in terms of promoting trade and
better market performance. Scholars usually proceed with a historical
analysis to explain that it is all the fault of the past which conditions the
present, and that legal change is bound to events that happened in the
past, as taught by the path dependency theory. Those past events have
a solid impact on legal culture, which becomes the catch-all factor that is
used to emphasise how and how much the past conditions the present.
But this explanation only partially satisfies us.

  In countries in transition and in the Global South, the ineffectiveness
of legal change is usually associated with the antagonistic relationship
that arises between local institutions and role-occupants (generally
judges, public officials, and Western consultants) sent to carry out re-
forms or provide local training, who treat legal data according to the
principle of the indifference and technical neutrality of the law,19 for
which societies that are different from each other can be governed by
the same rules.20 That same mechanism, however, is also observed in

the legal systems of the Global North, where the failure of legal reforms
carried out according to the functionalist approach is associated with
the dialectical tension between the autonomy of local constituencies
and the central institutions that impose top-down legal reforms. Empiri-
cal observation studies suggest that resistance to change is not linked to
cultural differences, as an exoticising view of non-Western laws might in-
itially seem to suggest.21 Reiterated conclusions as to the ineffectiveness
of legal change when pursued according to the abstract model of legal
transplants and the logic of “one size fits all” have recently prompted le-
gal scholars to explore the deeper relationship between law, considered
the main tool of legal change, and “societal forces”, “different vested
interests,” and “political interests”.22 Thus, it turns out that legal change,
in both the Global South and the Global North, depends on a number
of additional variables, such as the effects of informal processes on the
standardised discourse about the rule of law and democracy, political
choices and ideology, the role of cryptotypes, and customary practices
shaping implementational rules, as well as social practices that shape
the law.23 This implicit dimension of normativity that silently rules the
actions of individuals and communities may in fact be unveiled by ap-
plying the normative variant of Paul Grice’s theory of conversation de-
veloped by Marina Sbisa,24 and Rodolfo Sacco’s theory of cryptotypes:25
the “underlying patterns” can be revealed, or made visible through mi-

cro-comparisons of legal rules among different legal systems. The dis-
covery of a cryptotype is facilitated when, as happens, a legal rule, a
concept, or a principle implicit in one legal system is explicit in another
one. By logical and non-logical inferences of textual information from an
explicit rule, pragmatics tools unveil the connections between what lies
outside the text and what is inside it, what can plausibly be considered
as part of what a statute, a judgment, or a decree communicated when
it was produced, and what can enrich a legal rule without affecting its
truth value.26

  In the background lies the idea that law is a socially valuable practice
of regulation in a given time and place, a practice that reflects the vari-
ability of socio-legal conditions and contexts.27 What thus counts in de-
fining what is legal are particular social settings: law is not only what law
officials do and say they are doing, it is also a reflection of social values,
educational conditioning, ideology and economics.28

  The law then can appear for what it is: an interpretative socially valu-
able practice of formal regulations and customary rules in a given time
and place, made up of embodied subjectivities that find protection un-
der a wider notion of “citizenship” as part of the legal change itself; a
procedural notion of citizenship, understood as the social process of be-
ing engaged that facilitates cohesion, rather than a status, or a goal in
itself (a reward for being integrated) is then needed.

3. Choice is Good, but Community Engagement is Better: Citizenship

The uglier face of globalisation is shown when the law and legal change
processes admit their powerlessness in setting out the moral limits of
markets. One remedy that is often proposed is to lower their level of
complexity and then essentially solve the problem by reducing it to a
matter of self-determination and freedom of choice—because “choice

is good”.29 Such a solution, however, is not altogether convincing. We
believe that the question—or rather, the questions—should be restated:
how can states, markets, and other players involved in legal change—
both in the Global South and in advanced post-industrial, multicultural
countries—come to terms with deeply-rooted social structures that they
cannot change? To what extent does public opinion impact public poli-
cy? What difference does individual behaviour make? How do networks
of higher civil service elites (public administration, public management,
judiciary, etc.) shape legal change? In identifying the institutions that or-
ganise social, economic, and political interaction, can we also say, draw-
ing from cognitive science and ethnology, that the human mind “is the
first institution”, one shared by all human societies? Might the unity of
the human mind—because all humans share important common cogni-
tive frameworks, both with each other and with other hominids30—be a
crucial factor in social organisation and legal change?

  It is at this point that a broad vision of citizenship comes into play.
Based on active community engagement, it is citizenship understood as
a social process in which the greatest possible number of people par-
take;31 and not only humans,32 considering that the general principles of

29 The topic of personal self-determination in private law is the subject of extensive

     promoting sex work, and marriage brokerage contracts, nuptial agreements, but
     also usurious contracts as well as immoral suretyships, etc. See Aurelia Colombi
     Ciacchi, Chantal Mak, Zeeshan Mansoor (eds), Immoral Contracts in Europe (In-
     tersentia 2020).

30 We have an innate ability for the “mental score-keeping of services,” that is, a

perceptual organisation and the common framework of basic assump-
tions of the world, built on our genetic system, are something we share
with all species, or at least with all vertebrates.

  The citizenship debate first originated from concerns about social co-
hesion and the maintenance of public order in nation-states. It was a
censorious citizenship33 that arose within certain territorial boundaries,
based on a legitimisation of sovereignty of an ascending (from the peo-
ple), and no longer descending (from the divine) kind, referring to the
people, the nation, a singular identity.34 Today, the criteria for becoming
a citizen contained in national legislations have in practice become ob-
stacles to achieving citizenship itself, and to integration.35

  One of the basic principles of liberal states is that all citizens are for-
mally equal to each other and before the law. But as we all know, the
equality of citizens is intersected by many inequalities (by ethnicity, gen-
der, physical and mental disability, income, and so on) and compromised
by the substantial exclusion to the enjoyment of rights for noncitizens
(migrants, asylum seekers, refugees). For if there were no inequalities,
there would indeed be no need for anti-discrimination laws and inclu-
sion practices.

  Today, moreover, there can be no citizenship without taking the digital
dimension into account, just as there can be no “mature citizens” re-
gardless of the digital dimension.36 The point is not only the recognition
of a digital citizenship that has broken through the territorial bounda-
ries of nation-states, expanding to coincide with the concept of “neti-

zenship”—from [Inter]net + [cit]izenship.37 Current research is outlining
the figure of the “happy citizen”38 based on the principle of well-being,
as intangible collective capital, which is expressed in the preservation
and transmission of cultural heritage, collective memory, political par-
ticipation, peace, environmentalism, social equity and the inclusion of
minorities and vulnerable social groups. The idea of happy citizenship is
already at the core of political and regulatory decisions aimed at increas-
ing people’s well-being and life satisfaction, as witnessed by the OECD
projects.39

  The relationship between citizenship and the ideals of happiness
and well-being, integration, and equality is complex. In particular, the
goals of citizenship policies are not well defined, and generally at odds
with those of immigration. Among other things, the differentiation be-
tween citizens and noncitizens sharpens when migrants travel mainly
in South-North and East-West directions.40 This makes it desirable to
have a flexible notion of citizenship, based on solidarity-building mech-
anisms, traceable to the idea of pan-citizenship, to help further active
community engagement41 and greater tolerance of different lifestyles
and values, a notion that embraces social responsibility and aims to re-
duce the number of people with extremely limited rights. That means a
broader definition of citizen to include migrants, refugees, and marginal-
ised people in general, with stronger value placed on active community
engagement. Here, public participation goes beyond the turnout of vot-

4. The Contestability of Decision-Making Processes and the Micro-Di-
mension of Persons as Agents of Legal Change

In thinking about legal change, the focus should therefore be shifted onto
the dialectic between policy-making and the law. It can be observed how
the domestic politics of states and major changes within the national
political arena project outwards and reshape the legal structure of the
global system.45 Law cannot act as a substitute for political choices, as
witnessed by the adjudication process46—a privileged site of interaction
between the legal and the political—and by widely documented policy
transfers.47 While it is true that legal change is based on selective ad-

aptation under the pressure of specific political-economic interests,48 it
is also true that legal change is centred on the “contestability” of deci-
sion-making processes, where contestable means that there are no ma-
jor barriers to change.49

  In this changed epistemological horizon, the theory of legal change
is called on to explore the subjective micro-dimension, on a dual level:
on the one hand, individuals and, on the other, the collective. The key
notion advanced to explore this micro-dimension, proposed by Michele
Graziadei, inspired by psychological studies of the social formation of
the mind,50 is that of “mediated action”. Mediated action denotes action
performed by people through the instrumentality of material objects
and other kinds of artifacts, such as mnemonic techniques, algebraic
symbol systems, works of art, writing, schemes, diagrams, maps, me-
chanical drawings, all sorts of conventional signs, and so on.51

  This brings us to the question of languages, laws, and their design.
Drawing on the intuition that languages are social tools, the approach
we embrace provides the theoretical bases for understanding how le-
gal change processes occur in “places of engagement”, where discourse

turns into action,52 starting from schools and universities, where empha-
sis can be placed on the importance of graphic communication design
in creating not only visual communication, but also in changing people’s
attitudes and capabilities.53

  The reflection on words, terminologies, and “language” in general is
a fruitful and common starting point for the dialogue between law and
graphic communication design. In both areas, a tacit or mute dimen-
sion54 is admitted and represents much of what lies beneath the sur-
face. There are many silent rules, with people often knowing how to put
them into practice, but without being able to formulate them. However,
knowing “how to do” something is different from knowing “what to do”,
just as “knowing that” is distinct from “knowing how”55—a fact and an
awareness that are ultimately shared by both law and design. Knowing
what is the law is not only about the content of detailed legal rules and
the structures and concepts used by doctrine and legal actors, but also
about implicit sources, foundational principles and values underpinning
them; it is just as important as knowing how to go beyond written texts
or spoken words in legal communication, including images, rituals, feel-
ings and public performances as modes of human ruling and interpreta-
tion, 56 since legal texts imply more than they say.

  Continuing along this line of reasoning, it seems worth emphasising
that law and graphic communication design studies share the reflection

     Discourse Analysis (Routledge 2005); see for example Yoram Shachar, who illus-

56 The reflection on law & language covers a vast spectrum, from the absence of

     written forms to the multiplicity of representations forms: for instance, the perfor-
     mance of an act, or of a duty, acquiescence, or exercise of a right can be implied
     by silent, normative, rules: see Sacco 1995, 2015 (n 25); pictures and images have
     a normativity in themselves: see Anne Wagner and Richard Sherwin (eds), Law,
     Culture and Visual Studies (Springer 2014); Volker Boehme-Neßler, Pictorial Law.

on the relationship between alphabetical writing and visual codes in the
formulation and communication of complex messages.57 While recog-
nising the dominance of verbal language in human communication, at
least in our cultural context, both law and graphic communication design
specifically acknowledge that not all writing is alphabetical (such as in
China) and that not all writing is verbally oriented (such as the graphic
symbols used to represent numbers).

  The fact that all writing is a set of conventional graphic signs used to
represent, preserve, and transmit information by organising language in
physical and digital space58 is another relevant aspect for a promising
dialogue between law and design.

  Furthermore, transformative processes are completed through ideol-
ogies, which are tools that legitimise normativity.59 Ideologies are forms
of action aimed at orienting social beliefs, responding to the need to
build consensus, or resistance, towards legal change. It is in the nature
of ideology, given that its adherents will act in largely the same way in
similar situations, to facilitate the carrying out of joint tasks and contrib-
ute to group cohesion. In this sense, an ideology is essentially an “inter-
face” between individual practice and collective action,60 and interface
is another key word that can unite jurists and designers in contempo-
rary thinking, on which design studies can project their theoretical and
practical knowledge. Ideology has primarily been studied as a tool of

domination, or as an expression of benevolent paternalism—and both,
at certain times and under certain conditions, have been interpreted as
the realisation of ideals of justice.61 However, ideologies are above all
ambiguous and contradictory, and they have a finite temporal horizon.
They change over time, adapt to the context, and tolerate multiple per-
sonal affiliations and subtle variations in personal commitments; they
are forced to make continuous adjustments to accommodate what lives
on the margins, the singularities that animate the collective. As a circu-
lar process, it is the behaviour of the individuals that determines that
of the entire system, and obtaining the desired behaviour depends on
individual incentives and the individual framing of information.62 At the
same time, the behaviour of the system is deduced from that of the col-
lective. Thus rebound and other second-order effects, which refer to be-
havioural or other systemic responses after the implementation of new
laws, are important as well for legal change.63 The expected effects are
not equivalent to an engineering estimate, because of systemic and be-
havioural adjustments; habits and lifestyles are also factors that lead to
the mitigation or, more frequently, amplification of the rebound effect.
If we accept the shortcomings of a positivistic research paradigm, then
there is room to understand the indirect and society-wide rebound ef-
fects from a qualitative and theoretical perspective.

  Our micro-dimension starting point is therefore a stimulus for inves-
tigating legal change from the perspective of the well-being of the fi-
nal recipients of the normative message, of different subjectivities and
their positions in respect to the collective. But that is not all. What drives

63 It is worth noting that the literature regarding the rebound effect does not dis-
     tinguish between policy-driven rebound and “autonomous” rebound. It suggests
     that rebound effects are plural because a number of mechanisms are involved:

us to adopt this analytical and subjective perspective is the recognition
that the so-called Fourth Revolution,64 based on information and com-
munication technologies (ICT), has changed our understanding of the
world in the Internet and social media age, highlighting our nature as
“permanently interconnected informational organisms”.65 This nature of
ours is shared with both other biological organisms and artificial agents
(A.I.) within an ecosystem of information and message communication.66
Breaking free from human exclusivity in law and approaching a post-an-
thropocentric legality is an ontological turn that we can accomplish with
legal design.67 The more the ICT-dependency of contemporary societies
consolidates, the more important it becomes to delve into the issue of
regulatory profiles of digital technologies and the more important the
role played by post-human-centred design becomes in designing the ob-
jects and environments in which we live, interact, and socialise,68 espe-
cially considering the fact that we have all become “infomaniacs” and
“phono sapiens”.69

5. The Transformative Power of Law and Design

With the aim of clarifying what we propose as a different approach to
legal change from analyses based on backward-looking reference sys-
tems,70 in the following Sections we will introduce possible scenarios of
legal change led by collective practices and individual actions based on
speculative design and storytelling as tools for legal and policy change:
what we have named forward-looking reference systems.

  Engaging with design is only a recent topic of interest for jurists and
lawyers,71 in which design is generally treated as a skill that can be picked
up along the way, while the true experts in the room remain the jurists.
This has much to do with the mythical “lawyers’ mindset”72 that would
appear to be an insurmountable hurdle to the empathy that is central
to design—a mindset in which a jurist’s value is determined by their as-
sumed knowledge, made up of words and by the manipulation of words,
where failure must be avoided at all costs, the group of experts must
contain the least possible cognitive diversity, creating a situation of ho-
mophily, and the problem-solver is the leading role they can play.73 Be-
low, we will capture the opposite dynamic, when designers engage with
law, and in which design is applied to a legal context, to achieve that
“well-being of law as a practical idea”, a duty that we all have, as Roger
Cotterrell suggests74—what we might call service design, or systemic de-
sign (we will not linger here on the issues that certain taxonomies raise).
By relating the story of some practices carried out at our university, we
would like to stress the naivety of the assumption that a jurist or a law-
yer can turn their hand to being a service designer, or a graphic commu-

nication, or information designer. The training, aptitude, and experience
required to be skilled in design practices is relevant. The relationship
between jurists and designers ought to be mutually constructive. De-
sign methods draw on humanistic and technical knowledge and their
experience can break through the legacy of formal thinking,75 opening
up the legal setting to empathy, fictitious descriptions of users, visualis-
ations, peripheral information, and the experiences of others, while the
legal experience that designers require can be provided in co-design pro-
cesses, through the participation of jurists and the community at large,
and in speculative design practices. These practices76 do not run the risk
of distraction or self-indulgence: on the contrary, the vision of multiple
possible, or probable futures trains our serendipity, our ability to notice
the unexpected and make it constructive for change, our ability to de-
tect, interpret and connect accidental data or random phenomena from
the existing. Thus, in planning legal change for the benefit of society as
a whole, and for the individuals who interact under the law’s protection,
we may be able to move from where we are now to where we would like
to be.

6. Speculative Design for Legal Change in Public Services

Law and design are not knowledge for themselves, but knowledge for
action. They are social practices and poietic disciplines that can build
change in the future, starting from the observation of the present. By ex-
ploring alternative hypotheses to the question about people’s real needs
in a post-anthropocentric view that assumes a new relationship with na-
ture and for nature, they enable us to see the future possibilities for
what seems inadequate, ineffective, or unjust in the present (enabling
capacity of speculative design).

  Our hypothesis is that legal change can be successfully experimented
within the interdisciplinary space where law and design meet. Our ex-

perimental work focuses, in particular, on design strategies that specu-
late on the future and are implemented through participatory and social
interaction practices in the public services sector.77

  Public services are the sector that has attracted the most social in-
novation, involving the direct engagement of citizens.78 An exemplary
case is the UK Gov design team,79 which has had similar experiences in

few examples. In these cases, co-design activities focus on including user
needs in the actual design process of digital services.85 The degree of
community engagement varies from citizens as “co-implementers” of
services and activities formerly carried out by the government, to citi-
zens as “co-designers”, involved in designing the content and delivery
process of the services, to citizens as “initiators” of the design of specific
services.86 In general terms, some suggest using “co-production” “as an

81 The Team per la Trasformazione Digitale has a large developer community (De-
     velopers Italia) that creates new software and allows developers on other levels
     of government to reuse developed tools: developers, suppliers, civil servants, and
     citizens can collaborate to improve a common code base and customise public ser-
     vices using open-source architecture.

82 The Spanish Central Administration, via its Secretary General for Digital Transfor-
     mation, since the program “2017 Digital Strategy for an Intelligent Spain”, has used
     co-assessment ex-ante and ex-post evaluation for digital public services, where
     stakeholders are essential to measure the economic and social impact. A success
     case of co-assessment has been in the selection of the non-working days for noti-
     fications at the Tax Agency, based on a massive evaluation feedback from all stake-
     holders.

umbrella concept that captures a wide variety of activities that can occur
in any phase of the public service cycle and in which state actors and
lay actors work together to produce benefits”.87 With co-production, the
commissioning of services—seen as a “core public sector task [to be] un-
dertaken by politicians and top managers”88—is generally done by state
institutions and lay actors working together. This practice of “co-commis-
sioning”, used by digital government service teams in several European
countries, is prospective in nature, in that it is oriented towards the fu-
ture (a near future) and concerned with activities that may take place at
a later (but not too far) date.

  While this is the starting point for service design for public sector, in-
volving designers at multiple levels—in user consultation, service design
labs, customer journey mapping, neighbourhood and community regen-
eration forums, ethnographic research, participatory research, and so
on to redesign, for example, the websites for health care services, public
education, and senior citizens creating opportunities for interdepend-
ent living— our experimental practices draw more on speculative design
and design fiction as disrupting, visionary, imaginative, and provocative
methods89 that can fuel active participation by multiple actors with dif-
ferent interests and have a strong impact on legal change.

  The influence of future studies on design is not new; however, interest
has been growing especially late in design schools, and it seems to ree-
merge in times of crisis, when the need to think about alternative futures
becomes pressing. Nevertheless, future-oriented research methods and
interdisciplinary studies are currently only included in curricula at the in-
itiative of individual lecturers. Interest in future studies in the field of law
instead lags behind. Although in some cases the expression “future stud-
ies and law” appears to indicate an interest in exploring critical issues in
law, emerging technologies, and society, future studies have yet to be in-

corporated into regulatory processes and legal reforms—processes that
continue to be non-speculative and non-participatory, failing to engage
people and the community in the creation, planning, and organisation of
services, which in some sectors are crucial for their well-being (such as
environment, education, infrastructure, energy, and others).

  The tertiary education system and public institutions have a respon-
sibility to identify ways of engaging design students in the design of
public services, in the knowledge that only the active engagement of
designers in new interdisciplinary contexts can ensure the development
of the public services sector. At the same time, universities have a similar
responsibility towards law students, who are called upon to abandon
their traditional isolation, uniqueness, and specialness, and participate
in non-lawyer-dominated but rather interdisciplinary design activities.
Collaboration as a mode of dialogue between jurists and designers and,
indeed, as a wider template for social and political life, is the way for-
ward:90 legal change is embedded in the collaborative framework.

7. Storytelling and Design Fiction as Tools for Legal Change

The speculative design approach does not begin with product design
but “with laws, ethics, political systems, social beliefs, values, fears, and
hopes, and how these can be translated into material expressions”.91
That enables designers co-designing with legal experts and end-users,
i.e., the people to whom the legal regulations are addressed, to antici-
pate and imagine the future and concretely represent, through various
artifacts, the implications of legal choices made in the present.92

  Design fiction is the practice of creating artifacts that are not intended
to meet market needs, but rather to stimulate public debate and re-
flection through the construction of a narrative context. These artifacts
are effectively “thinking objects”—sometimes provocative in nature, so

called provotypes—that encourage critical discourse about changing the
status quo.93 Narrative, on the other hand, is an effective tool for over-
coming resistance to legal change by using empathetic language rather
than solely informative language. As all research on human cognitive
biases has widely shown,94 an abundance of information can lead to
greater resistance, rather than to a better understanding of the context.95
This is the so-called “backfire effect,” an expression coined to denote the
apparent impossibility of rationally correcting deeply ingrained beliefs.96
By raising public awareness of specific themes, narrative media, such as
cinema and literature, have demonstrated their ability to exert a direct
influence on the orientation of government policy in the United States,
for example, in the reorganisation of the psychiatric system, in building
consensus on massive investments in space exploration, in the overhaul
and modification of the administrative-bureaucratic apparatus, and in
the reorganisation of the health care system.97

  Starting in the designer’s educational career, design fiction can com-
bine law and politics, foresight and civic participation, within a conscious
and ethical narrative framework.98 This is not a mere exercise in futur-

ology. Rather, speculative design in general can help address the short-
comings of our current understanding of how legal change takes place
and broaden our understanding of key aspects of the law.99

  One of the crucial aspects that design fiction can help clarify in the
contemporary debate is the relationship between law and power, delving
into the question of whether the law is a product of power, as Norberto
Bobbio held.100 This assertion raises questions of justice, as power—be-
ing a flexible concept, understood as the authority to act for personal
or collective purposes, either through orders or through freedom—of-
fers only to those who hold it “a large space for the self”.101 Conversely,
the space for social participation is very limited. Whenever we lack the
right to participate on an equal footing, justice is called into question.
Including the needs of the individuals and collective through speculation
on the future in the actual process of designing public services and in
the regulations that govern them is a step towards an effective right to
participate. Furthermore, speculative design helps to develop tools that
are applicable to public policies and regulations, placing the necessary
emphasis on ethical concerns, as it has a counterfactual dimension and
provokes us to imagine a different reality from the one we are immersed
in, exploring it with awareness using scientific, technological, political,
and social knowledge to represent desirable futures.

  As argued in the previous Sections, our reflections offer a particularly
stimulating opportunity to critically engage in a discourse—in the spirit
of speculative design and storytelling—on legal change from a perspec-
tive of sustainability and equity.

  The complexity of the implications of such speculation can be ad-
dressed by drawing on interdisciplinary skills.

  Legal design is one such example,102 with the potential it has to change
and improve the status quo in the legal domain by using critical discur-
sive and fictional tools and exploring alternative regulatory approaches.

  Policy design is another example, as the dynamics of legal change
make it clear that the law is closely linked to politics. Hence, with the
general term policy design, we describe the action of defining the goals
of policies and the interdisciplinary design tools necessary to achieve
them.103

  Often the definition of a public policy constitutes a “wicked problem”,104
one of those problems whose cause can derive from bureaucratic, nor-
mative, technological, organisational constraints, or from political con-
ditions or a combination of all of these. In such cases, the solution to a
single problem, isolated from an overall vision, fatally risks exacerbating
the criticalities, rather than contributing to their resolution.

  The characteristics of a systemic design, which places relationships
and their sustainability at the centre, can therefore be particularly useful
in policy and legal design. The goals can be of various types: to modify
the policy-making practices, to allow the necessary institutional change,

102 Here we do not enter the discussion of whether legal design is or should be seen as
     a distinct discipline within design and/or law, or a post-disciplinary movement, or a
     nomadic practice, or a broad array of practices and studies: for a summary Ducato
     and Strowel (n 71), Allbon and Perry-Kessaris (n 98), Jackson and others (n 71),
     Santuber and Krawietz (n 32). See also Phoebe Walton, ‘James v Birnmann: The po-
     tential of critical design for examining legal issues’ in Lockton, Lenzi, Hekkert, Oak,

104 According to the definition by Horts Rittel, a mathematician, designer, and former
     teacher at the Hochschule fur Gestaltung (HfG) Ulm: “wicked problems are a class
     of social system problems which are ill-formulated, where the information is con-
     fusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with conflicting values,
     and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing”. This
     approach suggests that there is a fundamental indeterminacy (in the sense that
     there are no definitive conditions or limits to design problem) in all but the most
     trivial design problems. See Richard Buchanan, ‘Wicked Problems in Design Think-
     ing’ (1992) 8 Design Issues 5, 15-16.

or to build the capacity to co-design and implement systemic strategies
that can lead to potentially transformative policies and actions; and
the methods can be of diverse inspiration too: for example, the Polak
Game, where persons are asked to indicate their position with respect
to the experience of change (things are getting better/worse) and their
own contribution to change (I can do little/I can do a lot),105 the Futures
Wheel, a visual representation in which future repercussions are hypoth-
esised in various categories of thought—social, economic, philosophical,
religious, health, legal, ethical, and environmental,106 the Futures Cone,
with the representation of the alternatives of probable, plausible or pos-
sible futures among which to identify, by untangling the contingencies
represented by the wild cards, the preferable future,107 and the reverse
archaeology of the game The Thing from the Future, where participants
create a story from a set of random premises—temporal location, trend,
reference context, object type, and state of mind.108

  Instead of limiting ourselves to thinking about concrete answers and
solutions in terms of legal change or transformative policies, what is
even more interesting is that speculative design emphasises the impli-
cations rather than the applications; this means that it entrusts design-
ers—and their expertise drawing from different disciplines—with the
task of asking the right questions and no longer providing only answers
as problem-solvers. From this perspective, speculative design can make
a significant contribution to the formation of aware, informed, and em-
powered “citizens” (above Section 3) capable of rising to the challenges
of our present (design as world making).109

New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  57

  The use of narrative fiction does not compromise the concreteness of
co-designing legal change. This is evident if one considers the extent to
which imaginary scenarios are fundamental for the construction of the
social system. Narrative is indeed at the core of our ability to organise
extended and remote collaborative networks. The search for alternative
and ethically sustainable futures cannot, therefore, avoid questioning
the dominant narrative. Design fiction thus has the unique potential to
tackle the structural problems of our society, creating narratives of pos-
sible futures that help us question the reasons for the present. As said,
the goal of design fiction is to focus on a plurality of futures—probable,
plausible, and possible110—so as to steer reality towards those consid-
ered preferable, but in the awareness that the future, like any chaotic
system, contains all those forms of discontinuity and variability (“wild-
cards”) that, far from the classical deterministic view, make it unpredict-
able and not predetermined. Design fiction is also a tool for innovating
social practices because it presupposes broad participation in those
practices. Ultimately, this relationship between law, politics, and design
is the essence of the “design hope” invoked by Tomás Maldonado: “Po-
litically speaking, the revolutionary sense of dissent is really only attain-
able through design. Dissent that rejects hope in design is nothing but a
subtle form of consent.”111

8. Working with Futures: Some Examples

At a series of design communication workshops organised as of 2016 for
masters’ students at the University of the Republic of San Marino and at
the University Iuav of Venice,112 we experimented with the potential of
storytelling and design fiction to bring students to reflect on the impli-
cations of public service design and legal change—topics generally not
present in traditional design (nor in legal) curricula. The experience led
to the development of design communication workshops at the Univer-

     in Alessandra Bosco and Silvia Gasparotto (eds), Updating Values. Perspectives on
     Design Education (Quodlibet 2020); Sinni (n 92); Pasa and Sinni (n 77).

sity Iuav of Venice in collaboration with different institutions and, for
the last two years, with the Italian Government Department for Digital
Transformation.113 In the workshops, students were encouraged to map
the ecosystems, archetypes, and touchpoints of the main public admin-
istration services such as land management, mobility, health, education,
and culture, with the aim of tackling complex projects on the future of
the public services sector, playing with heterogeneous and hybrid visual
languages. 114

  The results of the projects, some of which are illustrated below
through the synopses developed by the students themselves, can help
highlight the dual function inherent to this learning approach: on the
one hand, building a common ground between future designers and
public decision-makers; and, on the other hand, transporting the project
into a critical and sometimes antagonistic dimension. Speculative design
frees the mind from the constraints of dominant thinking and allows us
to question even those socio-economic assumptions that, like cognitive
biases, prevent us from fully grasping the real opportunities for change.
Here, in the speculative narrative’s immersive space, it seems entirely
reasonable to propose radical legal change, such as, to cite just some of
the projects developed in the workshops: the end of the consumer sys-
tem and private property through a widespread goods sharing service;
demanding the disposal of one’s biometric data upon reaching legal age;
using a highly connected IoT network to do away with the prison system
through social control (utopia or dystopia? The choice is yours); or even
the design of a direct democracy system for guiding human communities
living in the hostile Martian environment.

Synopsis: By 2030, web platforms will all be connected to each other,
becoming the place where people constantly share information and per-
sonal data. The increasingly detailed info-trail they leave of themselves
online, however, will also be increasingly difficult to erase. Simply de-
leting one’s profile will not be enough, as the information entered over
time remains recorded and available to everyone. As such, the govern-
ment will provide a service that helps citizens understand the weight of
their shared information, offering the possibility to reset the data as they
feel is appropriate. That solution will be delete.me, an application that
communicates with social networks. People will be able to manage their
online image by deciding which content to obscure and, if necessary,
restore later, or delete permanently. In addition, they will have the pos-
sibility, through 3D scanning, facial recognition, and voice and text rec-
ognition to track down content, uploaded by others, that depicts them.
Such content will automatically come under a person’s control when
60  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

they reach the age of eighteen, as they contain their image and data.
Finally, the app will provide a documentation section that explains the
steps to take to eliminate one’s online presence.

Synopsis: Year 2040. After decades of crisis, the country is finally recover-
ing. The digitisation of services and public administration, initiated at the
beginning of the 21st century, will now be a reality. OP! is an institutional
monitoring and public participatory planning application. By accessing
the service with their digital identity, people will be able to monitor pub-
lic activities and view active projects in their residential area, as well as
national projects of interest. They will be able to actively contribute to
projects with appraisals, advice, and criticism. They will also be able to
propose original projects and see them implemented with community
New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  61

support. This service will involve citizens in collective interest projects
and optimise public spending.

Synopsis: In 2050, the world is in crisis. The environment, the economy,
and the demographic crisis are pressing problems. Complexity, unpre-
dictability, risk, and technologies have taken over, creating a digitalised
society at the expense of analog-human society. The situation has cor-
roded society to the point of its disintegration. As a result, individuals
have adopted more and more anti-social and introverted behaviour, ne-
glecting the need to establish human relationships. In response to the
need to focus on human beings and protect the environment in which
they live, a participatory system will be developed, which allows people
to express their thoughts within an Independent Theater. The idea of a
62  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

social theatre service is based on the ideal of classical Greek theatre,
which socialised citizens, and is therefore educational in its purpose,
while seeking to gather people’s opinions to pursue concrete actions
based on shared ideas. The social theatre service will be based on three
values considered fundamental: concertation, as there can be no dia-
logue without others; inclusiveness, as respect and personal opinions all
deserve equal importance; and physical experience, as it is important to
meet in person to fully understand what one does.

Synopsis: In 2050, the world is made up of smart cities, real jungles of
IoT systems where there is a constant exchange of information. In this
ultra-technological environment, Smart Jail will be a new type of prison,
developed using IoT systems to monitor all the movements of people
New Frontiers of Legal Knowledge  63

who have committed crimes. In 2050, the term “inmate” will no longer
be used, because Smart Jail will be designed to do away with prisons as
physical places and the concept of detention, for which people tracked
through Smart Jail will simply be known as “offenders”. The idea is to
replace prisons with a correctional environment that becomes a reha-
bilitation experience. Alongside the use of IoT systems, offenders will
be monitored through a localising wristband, equipped with hologram
technology enabling them to interact and self-organise their daily tasks
within a programme designed to stimulate socialisation and reeduca-
tion, aimed at their reintegration into society.

Synopsis: Year 2060. Climate troubles and the scarcity of raw materials
have led to a new awareness, enabling the sharing economy to take hold
much more than in the past, to the point that private property no longer
matters. Due to the unsustainability of the capitalist consumption mod-
64  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

el, people in 2060 will seek durable, high-quality products and services
for all their needs and lifestyle choices like never before. Artificial intelli-
gence will help people to be more aware of what is unnecessary, to know
their needs and manage their lives more wisely. Since people will no
longer have to perform and devote time to certain tasks, the time saved
can be spent on leisure or educational activities, as well as on personal
interests and hobbies. Oright will therefore operate in a post-capitalist
scenario, where the quality and circularity of products and services pre-
vails. Sharing high-quality products and services at affordable prices will
help break down the social barriers raised by ownership, in favour of a
different logic of collective utility. Oright will be designed for sharing any
material or digital good and service. Not having to own what one needs
can only be advantageous: guaranteed assistance and maintenance, sav-
ings on objects of little use, technological updates without supplements,
and flexible loans, etc.

Synopsis: Year 2100, planet Mars. Harmonia is a human settlement of
one million inhabitants on Martian territory. The planet is not yet ter-
raformed, but daily life is possible thanks to a system of pressurised
buildings and the local, self-sufficient production of resources. The gov-
ernance of Harmonia is ethical, welcoming, and human-scale. Its inhabit-
ants come from various countries on Earth, but on Mars they all become
citizens of Harmonia (and use only English as the common language).
Their motivations for joining the settlement vary—for scientific research,
humanitarian reasons, artistic inspiration, or simply adventure, but as
volunteers they are selected for their ability to contribute to the sus-
tainability and development of human society on Mars. Harmonia is a
direct democracy, in which all propose and vote on decisions collectively.
Harmonia is also a welfare state, in which everyone is a public employee,
essential goods are guaranteed for free and luxury goods can be enjoyed
through credits earned by performing activities useful to the communi-
ty. Public services in Harmonia are provided through a digital platform
that people can access via the numerous public terminals available and
via the personal devices they are each assigned. All political, economic,
and administrative life is managed through the Harmonia portal.

9. Conclusions

The future scenarios depicted by our students in their “objects of the
future” and provotypes projects can serve as inspiration for policy-mak-
ers and legal change. The common themes addressed include sociali-
sation, engagement, co-participation, training, education, and direct
democracy. This shows that legal change can be supported by design
fiction and speculative design, starting with the reform of public services
co-designed with people, as individuals and as a collective, to enhance
confidence and cooperation, and potentially reduce public spending. In-
corporating the experiences, practices, and speculative imagination of
individuals and communities into the design, planning, and implementa-
tion of public services through an outside-in approach allows the agents
of legal change to better understand how public services can be designed
to be of greatest use and benefit for individuals and communities.

  Our complex ecosystem—populated by states and markets, but also
individuals who perform social acts and by collective actions that are
66  Barbara Pasa and Gianni Sinni

conceived and actuated through verbal and nonverbal behaviours—is
constitutive of the ethical dimension of the law. The projects we have
presented, based on speculative design, storytelling, and design fiction,
focus on the ethical dimension of the law and regulatory processes.

  As said, many pressing issues of justice in the contemporary world in-
tertwine with legal change and its complex institutional and legal dimen-
sions, which include multiple perspectives that often emerge through
comparative law. The public space of the future and the common inter-
ests of citizens and society need to be filled with inclusive and accessible
services that aim to reduce social barriers through a logic of collective
utility and well-being. We believe in the power of mistakes, provocation,
speculation, and fiction in designing alternative legal changes, relying on
inclusive, participatory forms of law-making and policy-making from the
bottom up, driven by a collective civic agency that steers transformation.
To further this goal, a pedagogical turn is necessary, which involves build-
ing different educational tools for legal scholars and designers, including
teaching legal basics in design schools and incorporating provotypes, de-
sign fiction and co-design processes into legal training. This pedagogical
shift requires a radical change in the legal process as well, incorporating
co-design and speculative practices into the creation of legal rules, and
ultimately leading to a quest for justice.

Emily MacLoud

Abstract
Speculative design addresses concerns about the status quo by supporting critical
and creative thinking. As a methodology, it has been relatively under-utilised in the
domain of law. This article will explore what speculative design is, why it should be
employed in law and considerations to keep in mind when applying it in the legal
landscape. Speculative legal design presents a promising way to reflect on the im-
plications of emerging technologies and bring to light the various issues that plague
justice systems around the world. By reflecting on several examples including
an experience that was facilitated by the author hosting an interactive stall at the
book launch of Design in Legal Education edited by Emily Allbon and Amanda Per-
ry-Kessaris, the intention of this article is to provide legal design practitioners with
practical and complementary tools that they can apply in their own work. This ar-
ticle contributes to the growing body of literature that explores how design can be
used to make the world of law better, pushing the boundaries of the conversation
beyond the confines of design thinking.

1. Introduction

Design thinking is a problem-solving method that applies the creative
design process to traditional business problems.1 It has gained signifi-
cant traction as a way of solving the many problems that exist within the
legal field. Yet, another type of design may be better suited at identifying
problems that don’t yet exist and imagining the radically new socio-eco-
nomic and political paradigms that are needed for us to realise truly sus-
tainable and equitable futures. Design thinking is not enough. It doesn’t
enable people to step out of their current paradigm. It maintains the sta-
tus quo. Speculative design falls within the umbrella concept of critical
design, which offers a way to confront and challenge existing power im-

balances. By speculating on the future, this largely under-utilised design
method promises a way for those working in the legal field to explore a
wide range of possibilities outside the current realm. When conducted
respectfully and thoughtfully it can also allow for a greater diversity of
perspectives to be heard.

  This paper will begin with an introduction of what speculative design
is and present existing examples of how it is already being used within
the domain of law (Section 2). It will then describe the preparation, de-
sign and delivery of a speculative design experience and explore the
elements of the experience that had the most impact on participants
(Section 3), It will then conclude with a discussion about considerations
to keep in mind if legal designers want to start experimenting with this
methodology in their own practice (Section 4). The intention of this pa-
per is that it provides practitioners with the know-how to use this meth-
odology in their own work and inspires even more practitioners to start
speculating.

2. Solving Problems before They Become Problems

2.1. What Is Speculative Design?

The term speculative design was first coined by Anthony Dunne and Fio-
na Raby, two British design theorists, in 2001. The two popularised the
concept in their book, Speculative Everything: Design, Dreaming, and
Social Dreaming.2 The term was used to describe their work, which was
focused on exploring relationships between humans, technology, and
culture. The term has since been adopted by the broader design com-
munity and has been used to describe a wide variety of projects and
approaches.

  Many are familiar with design thinking, where problems are identified
at the beginning and after ideating on a series of novel solutions and
pathways, an approach is selected and tested.3 Speculative design differs
in a number of ways. Firstly, instead of identifying problems, speculative
designers identify hopes and fears, weak signals and insights generated
from extrapolating data and projections.4 Once this intel is collated, pro-
totyping can then commence. The second way speculative design differs
from design thinking is in the way it handles artefacts at the prototyping
stage.5 They are designed not to fix things, but rather to unfix them. The
outputs of speculative design are created to make future possibilities
tangible and to call into question aspects of the here and now. When
these outputs are done well, they have the potential to make the impact
of the future possibilities compelling in a way that no amount of data
can. Finally, speculative design is concerned with facilitating dialogue
and decision-making more so than it is about creating things. By “show-
ing not telling”,6 people are empowered to become active participants

in carving out the future they want to see. It is a multi-faceted design
method that can complement design thinking. The main elements of the
method are set out below.

2.2. Speculative Design Broadens The Scope of Problems that Design Can Solve

Speculative design is part of a wider movement of design known as crit-
ical design. More of a mindset than a methodology, through this lens
designers seek to critique the status quo. Described as the opposite of
affirmative design, which focuses on improving systems that currently
exist, critical design challenges “narrow assumptions, preconceptions,
and givens.”7 It challenges designers to see their role as provocateurs of
paradigms and to think laterally.

  Given the wide remit of critical design, those who practise specula-
tive design have the opportunity to solve problems that may not yet be
problematic. For instance, for Jason Tashea, producing the speculative
podcast series 40 Futures,8 provided him an outlet to share what he had
heard from academics and scientists during his days as a journalist: “A
lot of those interviews… would usually end with them saying, ‘So we’re
talking about the thing that’s happening now, but just wait five years
when X is going to occur.’”9 Tashea recounts that this material was also
often more interesting than what he was tasked to write about. In this
way, speculative design provides the means to focus on problems that
are not yet problems, thereby broadening the scope of problems that
design can usually solve for.

  Crucially though, designers who dabble in speculative design may pro-
pose concepts that lie beyond the boundaries of reality or dominant par-
adigms and venture into the imagination,10 but they do so with an eye
on critiquing aspects about the present state. For example, at first glance

Walton, could be mistaken for simply an imaginative version of a future
courtroom.11 However, it is much more than that. It is an intentional,
critical examination of the problems within western legal systems that
exposes deep-rooted injustices and inequalities by exacerbating the eth-
ical, social and cultural implications of technology gone wrong and social
and cultural biases unchallenged. This project makes fears and concerns
tangible and broadens the remit of what design can fix beyond existing
service experiences.

2.3. Speculative Design Provides a Way to Collectively Imagine

Speculative design not only feeds the imagination of the design profes-
sional who takes on the task of creating new worlds, it also feeds the
imaginations of those who engage with the designs. Given what we un-
derstand about history and the oppressors’ fondness for “policing the im-
agination”,12 this is crucial. Human beings are not very good at thinking
long term or outside the box,13 and often need help to think about the
future or about alternate realities. Speculative design enables a collective
to gather together and delve into imaginary possibilities, so that they can
make the right decisions in the present. It not only makes the future tan-
gible, it also offers the opportunity for more diverse voices to be heard.

  Speculative design can also unleash people from their current reali-
ties and stimulate their imaginations by offering a bridge between the
current reality and future possibilities. Speculative design proposals can
be thought of as devices that can “snap [participants] into the future,”14
and can prove very effective at helping people to collectively travel at
speed to imagined future-states. For example, a vignette about a pos-
sible future could act as a device that helps participants to discuss the
implications of future problems that might not exist yet. This can help

participants collectively engage in discourse and think deeply together
about the ethical, political, social and cultural ramifications of current
behaviours, decisions and technologies.

  By enabling collective imagination, the designer can foster sustainable
and equitable change. As social imagination agency Canopy puts it, “with-
out new and shared imaginations our society will stay stuck in its current
destructive and unequal patterns.”15 Finding ways to imagine together is
vital so that “the future is not built based on imaginations that are incom-
plete, one-sided and disconnected”.16 Speculative design creates the con-
ditions for shared imagining, thereby bringing forward the opportunity to
align on preferable futures that are inclusive, fair and just.

2.4. Speculative Design Forges New Perspectives through Discussion and Debate

Speculative design is not only focused on producing future visions, it
also facilitates dialogue between people. The design artefacts which are
produced to catapult people into alternate realities are often just the
starting point. Fostering discussion between participants who engage
in speculative design is crucial if the experience is to be impactful. As
directed by Damien Lutz, the Founder of Future Scouting,17 which is a
database of simple and effective speculative design resources, “whoever
your audience is – stakeholders, fellow designers, social media followers,
or the general public – make it easy for them to offer their interpretation
of your product”.18 This step is essential for it is often in the discussion
that ensues after a speculative design experience, where new perspec-
tives can be reached. Lutz encourages designers to provide questions
to participants to support them to articulate “why they do or don’t like
your future concept, how it might affect them personally, and what they

might prefer”.19 In doing so, people who are engaged can reflect on why
it matters to them and form their own opinions. Crucially, this paves the
way for people to respond to the speculative design experience and em-
powers them to take concrete steps towards the future they want to see.

2.5. Speculative Design Fosters Alignment towards Preferable Futures

As alluded to above, beyond imagining what futures may be possible
and relating it to oneself, speculative design also seeks to discern what
futures are preferable and encourages stakeholders to commit to action.
The Futures Cone first conceptualised by Trevor Hancock and Clement
Bezold in 1994,20 based on the taxonomy proposed by futurist Norman
Henchey in 1978,21 is often utilised to frame how to think about the dif-
ferent types of futures that are possible, plausible, probable and prefer-
able:22
–– The possible cone includes futures that may happen;
–– The plausible cone includes futures that could happen;
–– The probable cone includes futures that are likely to happen; and
–– The preferable cone includes futures that we want to happen.

  Most design efforts are orientated around what is probable. Specu-
lative design is most interested in identifying futures that sit within the
preferable zone.

  This framing can be useful for mapping speculative futures. For exam-
ple, scenarios, which are described as “compilations of trends into dif-
fering images of the future”,23 can be mapped onto the futures cone and
provide a clear way to compare a range of options. This mapping provides
the opportunity to examine these futures in depth, which can be at once
liberating and sobering. In making a choice between different futures,
designers also enable values, held both individually and collectively, to be

made visible.24 Alignment is fostered by realising where various futures
are and having discussions about how to get to the preferred future.

2.6. Speculative Design Catalyses Action

Once the speculative designer has identified what they want to critique,
provided a way for participants to collectively imagine a new world,
forged new perspectives through discussion and debate and aligned par-
ticipants around the preferred future, the final step is to elicit a “com-
mitment to action”.25 Without this final step, a lack of control may start
to set in and along with it, the preferable futures may become just an-
other workshop relic, that’s too distant, too fleeting and too hard to at-
tain. Depending on the size of the project, this step could either involve
back-casting a future strategy and optimising and adapting it in order
to stay on track toward the preferred future, or it could be as simple
as creating a website that shows what the future could be and tracking
and recording feedback and reactions.26 As designers, there is a need to
create things that have an impact and are useful. This last element gives
speculative design its edge.

2.7. But Why Employ Speculative Design in Law?

Using speculative design in the legal domain makes sense for many rea-
sons. Primarily, speculative design can be most useful when it critiques
the status quo.27 As described succinctly by Paul Magrath, Head of Prod-
uct Development and Online Content at Incorporated Council of Law
Reporting for England and Wales, “whether you get the future right or
wrong – it doesn’t matter – it makes you question the present”.28 Similar-
ly, as Walton highlights in her reflective piece about her student project

James v Birnmann, it is only by stepping into the impossible, and offering
speculations that are far-fetched that it is possible to crystallise concerns
with the status quo.29 To demonstrate this, it is useful to look at one of
the concepts she focuses on, which is that “law is a continual perfor-
mance” and that “courtrooms are the epicentre of this charade”.30 By
including seating for an audience in front of the typical courtroom and
featuring “ON AIR” signs on top of the doors (see Figure 2), she makes
tangible the illusory nature of the law as objective and calls into question
the role of rituals and symbols used in the law. This example demon-
strates how design artefacts can challenge our preconceptions about the
law and reveal areas that need critical attention.

  Using speculative design in the legal domain also addresses what
Dabaghi describes as “the most potent drawback of design thinking”,32
which is the fact that it is “focused on solving problems that already
exist”.33 Speculative design can explore the unintended consequences
of introducing new technologies into the courtroom,34 or the implica-

tions of possible future criminal justice processes,35 before they happen.
It acts as a way to forward-plan and start thinking about the possible
issues to come.36 As Daniel Hoadley, Head of Data Science & Analytics
at Mishcon de Reya LLP highlights, the biggest challenge facing his team
isn’t the obvious technical hurdles of introducing data science into legal
processes, but rather it’s trying to understand both the positive and neg-
ative implications of introducing new technologies.37 He notes that this
methodology would be relevant for his team as it could usefully act as
another form of data governance. By reimagining what the law might be,
speculative design can spark critical debate about what the law should
be.

  When done well, speculative design can also be a useful way to elicit
an empathetic response and make the law “palpable.”38 The Touching
Contract is a live performance and an example of an especially emotive
design fiction that makes the law relatable (and at times physical), chilling
and uncomfortable. It was an immersive evocative performance that ex-
plored “law’s relationship to violence, suffering and vulnerability” by us-
ing the female body as a “repository for legal histories.”39 Indeed, Karma
Dabaghi contends that speculative design intends to create a “strange or
unsettling atmosphere” that “generates a feeling of menace or fear of
what might come as a result of current practices”.40 Speculation isn’t just
about exercising the brain, crucially it is also about engaging the heart.
In so doing, it can capture audiences in new ways and make people feel
differently about the law.

  Using speculative design in the legal domain can also act as another
way to get wider audiences interested and engaged. Justice is known to
suffer from a publicity problem, often not getting the same recognition
or public support as other fields like health and medicine. Even Shake-

speare pokes fun at this: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.”41
By being approachable and relatable, these designs can entice people
into the domain of law and enable them to engage in important subject
matter that they may not think about often. As one commentator de-
scribed the successful speculative fiction series 40 Futures: “[it’s] kind
of like sitting with your very smart, engaging friend at a bar and talk-
ing about what they think the world will look like in 2060.”42 For Jason
Tashea, the creator of the series, this was his exact intention: “I was hop-
ing that people that are not in our world would use it as an on-ramp to
be interested in our world.”43 By opening up the world of law to new and
larger audiences, speculative design has the potential to engage even
more people in critical debate and ensure the justice system not only
remains accountable to the people but also retains its relevance as a
cornerstone of our society.

2.8. Applying Speculative Design

Although applying speculative design in the domain of law is quite novel,
a number of topics are emerging as popular focal points for these types
of projects. The courtroom tends to be a favoured subject for specula-
tive designers. Described as the “epicentre” of legal structures,44 its rit-
uals and symbols have been examined, critiqued and modified by these
designers in a number of ways. Some projects have used the courtroom
as a platform to consider fundamental aspects of the law, while others
have speculated about humanity’s place within a wider ecosystem of
justice that also involves animals and our shared environment.45 Regard-
less of the setting, speculative design projects tend to be densely packed
with meaning and cover multiple topics. Helpfully, explanations are of-
ten provided alongside the design artefacts as supportive commentary.

  The projects below have been selected because they each share sim-
ilar focal points (the principle of open justice), but their approaches and
interpretations are drastically different. The comparison intends to high-
light the variety of speculative design techniques. It also seeks to show
how the same subject matter can be portrayed and the result is a better
understanding of the nuances of the challenges that we face.

  In the already mentioned James v Birnmann, Phoebe Walton presents
a future where the legal system is maintained by AI.46 This project has
several layers, one being the contention that “law is a continual perfor-
mance”.47 She amplifies this in a number of ways, including presenting
the courtroom as a stage complete with props and costumes, lighting
booms, spectator seats and artificial crowd noise. By presenting the
courtroom theatrically, Walton is calling attention to not only the impact
of the media framing the public’s perception of law through fictional le-
gal dramas and televising real cases,48 but laterally she is also highlight-
ing the implications of the principle that law must be seen to be done,
commonly referred to as the open justice principle. It showcases the risk
of reducing the principle to its performative quality. In her words, the
project “invites the audience to question their current relationship to
the legal system and perception of the law.”49 As the next two examples
demonstrate, this is just one way to examine and elicit responses about
this fundamental principle of the legal system.

  The Policy Lab team that brings its “multidisciplinary expertise to help
teams understand the present, imagine the future and design ways to
achieve the policy impact they intend,”50 also explored the principle that
justice must be done in the open so that it can be subjected to public and
professional scrutiny, but took a drastically different approach. In 2019,
the team was tasked with the challenge: How do we maintain open jus-
tice in a digital world? and to address this, the team prepared and ran
four 2-hour sessions with members of the public.51 The sessions were

split into two parts, where the first part focused on what people already
knew and thought about open justice and the second part (the bulk of
the session) was focused on using provocations to understand what the
participants thought and felt about open justice. The provocations were
hypothetical future scenarios that were loosely based on options being
considered by HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS). The team at
the Policy Lab used the provocations to ignite discussions about the fu-
ture between participants. After a process of synthesis, common princi-
ples were distilled and packaged up for HMCTS so they could be used as
helpful guides when designing future open justice delivery mechanisms.
On reflection, HMCTS noted that speculative design revealed “inter-
esting findings in a more emotive way”.52 The HMCTS team also spoke
about wanting to use provocations again and highlighted that the meth-
odology could be used to explore “the more emotive and organic re-
actions to the topic”.53 This example showcases how speculative design
can be used to influence strategic policy decisions within mainstream
government services.

  The third example that tangentially explores the principle of open jus-
tice is from Eeda Da Gyung Lee, who produced Virtual Justice: Courts of
the Future which, put simply, presents a VR court platform that man-
ages criminal activities committed in virtual space.54 The project stems
from her own experience as a juror in criminal trials, in which she had
“difficulty in understanding the legal processes” and had felt “really
frustrated with the adversarial environment that [she was] not famil-
iar with”.55 Like Walton’s project, this project also has many layers. With
relevance to the open justice principle, this project may be perceived as
critiquing the adversarial built environment and brings into question the
need to be physically present in the courtroom in order to access court
proceedings. In this fictional courthouse there exists a separate space,

called the Archive Portal, in which the public can easily navigate through
all the previous cases that are stored in cubes (see Figure 3). Virtual re-
ality (VR) technologies enable the public to immerse themselves in the
evidence and testimonies, which is bringing attention to the emerging
trend of using VR in criminal cases today.56 The public are provided with
comprehensive access “so that [they] can understand and participate in
a more engaging way”.57 Da Gyung Lee also represents those participat-
ing in the trial as avatars because of her own experience of feeling “in-
secure” when the accused looked at her when she was a juror. In order
to access the trial, these participants are required to pass through an
identification system. In contrast, she felt that the public who were sim-
ply perusing cases in the Archive Portal need not identify themselves. By
bringing to light her own concerns with the justice system, she has tan-
gentially also critiqued the principle of open justice by pondering how it
might materialise in the future.

  These three projects present different perspectives and value judg-
ments about the future. They each focus on the idea of open justice, but
portray very different worlds where this principle remains intact. In so
doing, they reveal the nuances of the principle and how it can operate
now and into the future.

2.9. The Techniques and Tools of The Trade

Borrowing from Futures work and art forms like cinema and literature,
speculative design uses a variety of techniques and tools to critique, en-
gage, elicit empathy and foster debate. Designers who practise specula-
tive design may use techniques and tools that are familiar but they use
these to critically reflect on the current paradigm and the corresponding
interplay between social, economic and technological developments.
The key difference is that these techniques and tools aim to destabilise
the status quo, rather than just improve it.

2.9.1. Scenarios
Speculation on the future can lead to the generation of a range of sce-
narios. These snippets of the future-state can take the form of short sto-
ries and describe new possibilities or new challenges related to a critical
issue. The scenarios produced by the Policy Lab (described as “provoca-
tions”) are good examples because they are plausible, logically coherent
and internally consistent.58 Scenarios can either act as prompts where
the speculative designer develops the scenario themselves and presents
it as a way of fostering discussion,59 or they can be developed by partic-
ipants in a workshop so that participants consider elements of critical
issues that are relevant to them.60 Regardless of how they are utilised,
most practitioners note that scenarios should avoid straying into the
zone of fantasy,61 nor should they present a world where everyone gets

along or where technological silver bullets have saved the day.62 Futures
that are spelt out in scenarios are “not a destination or something to
strive for” but rather they are “a medium to aid imaginative thought”.63
Scenarios form the basis of many other speculative techniques and tools.

2.9.2. Design Fictions
Design fictions make these scenarios tangible. They stretch beyond mere
stories and envision the worlds in which those stories take place.64 De-
scribed by Nick Foster as “expertly designed artefacts” that can “com-
municate complex information in ways that are generative and provoc-
ative, but also systematic and precise”, design fictions are the output
of careful and critical design.65 For example, a design fiction may be a
cereal box that takes the elements of a normal cereal box (the contents,
where things are made, where they were sold, how they were sold and
the technology used) and re-imagines this in the future while simultane-
ously critiquing the social, economic and technological dynamics of the
status quo.66 The best design fictions are meticulous and believable.

2.9.3. What if… Prompts
Questions beginning with “what if” can be used as a tool to help build
scenarios and design fictions. Unfinished, these prompts open space
for discussing and considering alternative possibilities and options. The
power of this simple technique is that it can cover paradigm shifts (for
example What if we abandoned the dominant common law model?),
systemic shifts (for example What if we redesigned legal systems for the

end user?67 or What If Psychology Redesigned the Criminal Justice Sys-
tem?68) or product and service shifts (for example What if we no longer
needed to consider regulation?69). They are a flexible and effective tool
but require structure. Participants who complete what if prompts should
be given the space to engage in discourse with others after they frame
this new world, in order to think them through and consider any relevant
implications.

2.9.4. Social Dreaming
Social dreaming techniques recognise that imagination is both a “re-
source and a battleground”70 and acknowledges that “most people are
forced to live inside someone else’s imagination”.71 This technique has
been described as a “way of working with dreams where the focus is on
the dream and not the dreamer, where dreams are shared amongst peo-
ple who come together solely for this purpose.”72 Key to social dreaming
is the ability to build dreams through association, which requires partic-
ipants to share and also engage with each other’s contributions. The dif-
ference between scenarios and social dreams is that scenarios are often
developed independently, whereas social dreams are developed collec-
tively. Social dreaming allows groups of people to build worlds together,
which can then act as effective platforms for developing design fictions

that are provocative and tangible.

2.9.5. Backcasting Activity
Backcasting reverses the process of forecasting. It is often used to iden-
tify the actions, policies and programs needed to arrive at a desired fu-
ture-state.73 The use of backcasting techniques, also makes the process
of achieving the vision more manageable by breaking it into components
(actions, policies and programs) bringing greater focus and clarity in the
short-term. This activity is a useful way to catalyse action given it sets
people up to assign responsibility and keep one another accountable.

2.9.6. Worst Case Scenario Planning
Worst case scenario planning is another form of analysis that, similarly
to backcasting, can be used to determine the steps involved to bring
about a particular future. The key difference is that the particular future
that is focused on in worst case scenario planning is one that is not desir-
able. It is a powerful technique to identify the multiple steps that would
need to be taken in order for society to reach the worst case scenario,
as it is often a combination of technical, social, economic, political, and
legal changes that occur incrementally and combine that bring about the
futures we don’t want.74 The technique also presents ample opportunity
to reflect on the “story arc” of new technologies,75 and identify what
interventions could look like and when they should occur.

  There are several other useful techniques and tools. Databases such
as The SpeculativeEdu Online Repository,76 are useful as they contain
further documentation about various methods, approaches and tools
speculative designers use in their practice. Depending on the speculative

design approach undertaken, these techniques and tools can be tailored
for the desired effect.

2.10. New Frontiers

These examples are helpful in establishing how to apply speculative de-
sign in the law. But they are limited. In considering how else speculative
design can be applied in the domain of law, it is useful to look at how it
has been used in other sectors that have been using the methodology
for much longer.

  In the architecture and urban planning field, speculative design has
been used to win work and create projects that explore alternative fu-
tures and the potential impact of new technologies on social and eco-
nomic life, to great effect. A prime example is the work of speculative
design agency Superflux, which was invited by the United Arab Emir-
ates government to develop a way for their senior decision-makers to
experience numerous possible futures around energy and stress test
their implications.77 They created several models of future metropolises
to make the data (that they extrapolated from the Ministry’ of Ener-
gy’s econometric data and projections) experientially evocative. These
models helped the participants to understand the dynamics between
financial investments and social, economic and technological develop-
ments and the impact this would have on the environment and society.
Participants were taken through five different future worlds that con-
tained various design artefacts to make these futures more real. The
most compelling artefacts were the series of air samples from the years
2020, 2028, and 2034. Samples contained a combination of chemicals
such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide based
on climate and fossil fuel emission projections. Described by Superflux
as “noxious stuff” and “impossible to inhale”,78 this crystalised the dis-
astrous impacts of current behaviour in a way that predictions and data
simply cannot. The experience had an almost immediate effect on the
participants and is said to have informed the UAE’s National Energy

Strategy 2050, which will invest $163 billion in renewables.79 This exam-
ple highlights the importance of engaging the right stakeholders in the
experience and the role of design artefacts to make the future feel real.
It also presents several provocations for legal design practitioners, like
how might we use smell to engage people in policy change or how might
we make the dynamics between social, economic and technological de-
velopments tangible so that we can evaluate the impact this will have on
the justice space?

  Major companies are also spinning up teams focused on the future.
For example, Google X, which is the so-called “moonshot factory at Al-
phabet” is a lab that is trying to resurrect dreaming big and inventing
things.80 They conceive prototyping “in its broadest possible terms” and
make the future tangible by creating things like imaginary corporate web-
sites or receipts for future dinners.81 They also employ different kinds of
specialists, who each bring a certain perspective to the table. Explained
simply by Derek Thompson, the method they follow is threefold: “First,
[they] must address a huge problem; second, [they] must propose a radi-
cal solution; third, [they] must employ a relatively feasible technology.”82
This set up poses a challenge to those working in the legal domain: What
if we created a Speculative Legal Design Lab? What if we invited a cross
section of specialists to solve some of the biggest problems facing the
justice sector? What if we followed the three part formula to identify
problems before they become problems? These frontiers are yet unex-
plored and present an exciting space to experiment in.

3. Experimenting with Speculative Design

3.1. Background

The editors of Design in Legal Education,83 Emily Allbon and Amanda Perry-
Kessaris, wanted the launch for their book outlining what design can do
for legal education, to give attendees an immersive experience into legal
design.
–– Making ideas visible and tangible: Participants were invited to use

  Lego to imagine different ways of teaching/learning and other re-
  al-world legal scenarios.
–– Get user-centred: Participants were invited to use personas and jour-
  ney maps to consider different types of legal environments and appro-
  priate responses.
–– Thinking outside your box: Participants were invited to use the 5 Whys
  technique to understand the root cause of problems.
–– Simplify legalese: Participants were invited to re-write legalese using
  simple and straightforward language.
–– Speculative Design: Participants were invited to imagine future legal
  environments, prompted through sound, imagery and scenarios.
–– Comic Strips: Participants were invited to create a comic strip explai-
  ning something legal.

Each attendee was given a legal design passport (see Figure 4) and could
engage with the activity as much or as little as they liked, and in what-
ever order suited them (whilst collecting a ‘stamp’ at each stall). They
were also given a “Spot the case” card;84 an illustration of an attic where
pictorial clues for various landmark UK cases lay amidst the clutter. There
were prizes for the most successful clue unravellers.

  The following sections describe the preparation and delivery of the
speculative design stall, which sought to pose critical questions about
the future of legal environments (and other related topics) and facili-
tate discussion between participants. This section ends with a discussion
about what we learnt about using speculative design in the legal domain
through the experience.

3.2. Preparation: What We Did

Prior to the event, three learning goals were developed in connection
with the speculative design stall. These learning goals sought to clarify
the purpose of the experience and helped guide not only the preparato-
ry steps and the delivery of the experience, but also the reflection that
is set out below.

  Desktop research was undertaken about the various types of spec-
ulative design techniques and tools that could be used, taking into ac-
count constraints such as the time, space and budget available and the
expected number of participants. As a source of inspiration, other exam-
An Exercise in Speculative Legal Design  97

ples of speculative design experiences were also explored. In particular,
previous work undertaken by Portable in the death and ageing space,85
and the economic and taxation space were examined and elements
identified that were going to be crucial for success (such as having a way
to catapult participants into a future-thinking state). An approach was
subsequently developed, which clarified:
–– Why we were using speculative design as a methodology (the why);
–– What we would be speculating about (the what);
–– How we would engage participants (including the invitations we would

  offer participants, what artefacts would act as inputs, what artefacts
  would be created as outputs, and constraints to consider) (the how);
  and
–– How we would make sense of the data after the experience and what
  we would do with it (the next steps).

  This approach worked well as it narrowed the focus of the exercise
and provided the scaffolding to start developing the design artefacts
that would be utilised.

  Artefacts were then created, which were made available on the day of
the event (Figure 5).

1 A series of simple, fictional provocations that began with What if… These

      questions were intended to provide prompts for discussion and also to
      exemplify the types of contributions participants could make on their
      own. Examples included:
      –– What if we replaced “access to justice” with “access to equity and wel-

         lbeing”?
      –– What if you could choose to have your case decided by an algorithm?
      –– What if you lost your senses as retribution for your crimes?
      –– What if students redesigned our law schools?

2 A laptop, with headphones, was made available for participants to en-

      gage in the website: https://speculativejustice.softr.app/ The website
      was created for the event. The website contains:
An Exercise in Speculative Legal Design  99

      –– A series of short videos about speculative scenarios set in the future,
      –– A series of informal speculations about the future of justice and legal

         education (since updated with the participants contributions),
      –– Resources about speculative design, and
      –– A form to submit feedback.

3 Participants were invited to write their own hypothetical scenarios about

      the future. The prompt cards contained the words “What if” followed by
      three blank lines, inviting participants to write down their framings of
      the future. They were guided by a facilitator to use the existing provoca-
      tions as examples.

         The space was also arranged so that participants felt comfortable
      while watching the videos or writing down their own hypothetical sce-
      narios (seats were provided) and also felt that they had enough room
      to add their contributions to the board, read other contributions and
      engage in dialogue relating to the contributions.

      3.3. Delivery: What Happened

      Approximately 30 attendees participated in the speculative design ex-
      perience (see Figure 5). Several participants engaged in discussion after
      reading the provocations, watching the videos or writing their own hy-
      pothetical scenarios about the future. This led to several insightful con-
      versations.

3.4. Discussion: What We Learnt about Speculative Design

During the event, through observation and engagement with partici-
pants, a number of patterns started to emerge. Following the event, we
also spoke with a couple of attendees to gather their reflections about
the elements that were most impactful. The insights below provide an
outline about what we learnt and shed light on some key considerations
to keep in mind when utilising speculative design in the legal domain.

3.4.1. Be Intentional about the Space
Given this particular exercise was conducted in person, we were fortu-
nate to be able to also consider the experiential component of the exer-
cise. As pictured in Figure 6, the space was arranged so that it felt inviting.
It also sought to encourage participants to make their own connections
between ideas. As one of the participants commented in relation to the
arrangement of the table and chairs, “it was very conversational” and in
relation to the board arrangement, “the way the boards were arranged
meant that after you made your contribution and you put it up… the way
the ideas were put together meant that they weren’t in isolation… they
were intersecting with one another.86 Working in the physical space was
a great opportunity, as it afforded a range of ways for participants to en-
gage not only with the prompts but also with each other’s ideas.

86 Interview with Vic Duarte, Student, City University (Virtual, 28 January 2023).
An Exercise in Speculative Legal Design  101

3.4.2. Enable Participants to Engage in Dialogue and Associate Ideas with
One Another
Although several participants engaged in debate and discussion with the
facilitator and/or other fellow participants after submitting their own
What if scenario or watching the videos, there were many that did not.
This presented a missed opportunity. If we were to run a similar exer-
cise, we would provide a way for participants to associate their ideas
with others and offer this through simple dialogue with others or, for
those participants that may be a bit uneasy with this step, offering them
a chance to associate ideas using string or some other more passive me-
dium.

  Regardless, one participant noted that they appreciated being able to
pin their contribution to the board because it felt like they were “adding
to a conversation.”87 This participant also liked being able to read other
people’s work, which encouraged her to “push [her] brain to think about
it differently.”88 However, other commentators have noted that this may
potentially limit the thinking of the participant since they’ll immediately
(perhaps subconsciously) work within the same style and constraints as
the examples they see and that it may in fact be more effective to let
people see other contributions only after making their own.

3.4.3. Have a Device that Can Snap Participants into the Future
Providing the prompts (in the form of provocations and the series of
short videos about speculative scenarios set in the future) provided
structure for open responses from participants and enabled people to
have reflective, relevant and meaningful conversations. As one partici-
pant put it: “It’s a good exercise for us lawyers because we’re so used
to rules. It’s hard for us to be creative.”89 The devices painted the scene
and positioned participants in the future which enabled them to unpack
these worlds and start creating their own. Indeed, one of the partici-
pants later reflected that it was helpful having so many aides that did
not steer people in a certain direction but instead sought to “push them
forward”.90 Providing these devices meant the exercise felt approachable

102  Emily MacLoud

and intentional, which the participants appreciated.
  Participants are also more likely to engage in second-order thinking, if

they are provided with a prompt to start from. During the exercise, par-
ticipants who read through the provocations, then participated in the ex-
ercise by creating their own hypothetical scenarios, felt challenged and
subsequently channelled this thinking and applied this thinking to their
current reality. One participant who was challenged by the provocation
What if you could choose to have your case decided by algorithm? sub-
sequently wrote as his hypothetical scenario What if a legal AI machine
designed to solve cases hides a bug? This example demonstrates how
speculative thinking can kick-start a series of questions, expand thinking
and reframe possibilities.

3.4.4. Provide Neutral Provocations; Participants Are Likely to Apply Them
to Their Own Context and Make Them Personally Relevant
Many participants engaged in conversation after reading the provoca-
tions that were provided. Discussions were initiated by the provocations,
but traversed into areas that were personally of importance to partici-
pants. For example, a participant who was a shipping lawyer focused on
the provocation What if you could choose to have your case decided by
algorithm? Rather than focusing on this particular topic, he discussed
that he wasn’t taught about algorithms at law schools or their ethical
implications, but regardless of his line of work, he was facing legal deci-
sions about ships being controlled by AI-powered navigation systems.91
This highlighted for him that legal education is less about the factual
nature of right now, and more about equipping the lawyers of tomor-
row with the ethical logic needed to make decisions about technology
that doesn’t even exist yet. This is contrasted with another participant,
a lecturer, who told me that after reading the provocation What if the
environment could appear in court as defendants, complainants and wit-
nesses? She was prompted to think about what she would need to teach
her law students about complainants and witnesses in order for them
to make those decisions in the future.92 Interestingly, these two partici-
pants arrived at the same conclusion (i.e. that legal education should fo-

An Exercise in Speculative Legal Design  103

cus on principles and build foundational knowledge) but through differ-
ent routes, highlighting the power of speculative design to bring about
alignment between people.

3.4.5. Enable Anonymity so People can Contribute Freely
The prompts were effectively blank cards, with three lines that invited
participants to frame a speculative future of their choice. No names
were attached to the cards. One participant highlighted the positive ef-
fect this had on her and her willingness to be vulnerable: “It’s hard to be
vulnerable like that and put the first thing that comes to mind out there,
especially when it’s in front of people. I think there was something about
each of the cards being slightly anonymous to write and an extension of
the stall.”93 This reflection highlighted the importance of providing differ-
ent ways to contribute, from the passive to the active.

3.4.6. Provide a Psychologically Safe Space
Speculating about the future can provide an opportunity to critique the
status quo in an emotive way. For example some participants described
the emotional impact of the experience, noting that it felt and presented
a good opportunity to vent.94 This highlights how speculative design can
not only highlight weaknesses within the status quo, but it can also be an
emotional outlet for people providing a space for them to engage in the
subject matter with their heart, not just their head.

  Speculating about the future can also highlight redundancies, which
can be uncomfortable. Some participants used the opportunity in their
hypothetical scenarios to imagine a world without their profession or or-
ganisation in it. For example, one participant who was himself a lecturer
wrote What if there were no lectures only problems, solutions, teams
and mentors? and highlighted that he did not think lectures were an
effective learning tool.95 Another participant, when speculating about a
world where his professional role may become redundant, highlighted
that “speculative thinking could be scary for people”.96 Speculative de-

sign can make us face our darkest fears and areas that need attention by
bringing into the spotlight that which we often wish to brush away.

4. Let’s Speculate!

Experimenting with speculative design can feel daunting. It not only
requires the designer to be critical and creative, but also boldness and
bravery. The following discussion breaks down the key considerations to
keep in mind when starting to experiment with this methodology. It be-
gins with a discussion about what the designer needs to consider before
they can get going (the designer). It then speaks about the challenges
associated with choosing the right focal point for the speculation (the
problem), before considering how it might be introduced at an organi-
sation (the organisation). Given the present challenges facing the legal
domain, it’s time to be bold and start speculating. Below we discuss how.

4.1. The Designer

Fundamentally, the designer has to consider themselves as creative. For
many legally trained professionals, this can be challenging. As Vic Du-
arte, a student who participated in the speculative legal design exercise
reflected about her own legal education, she described feeling “the need
and pressure to shut down creativity… because [she] felt like that’s the
way that it’s interpreted and how [she] had preconceived what it meant
to be someone who is part of the law, studying the law contributing to
the law.”97 Regardless, there is a strong movement of lawyers embracing
new mindsets and embracing creativity.98 Unleashing the creativity with-
in oneself is the first step to becoming a speculative designer.

  For every designer, recognising one’s own values and drivers is key if
one wants to create an authentic practice.99 For designers who undertake
this work, they are often motivated by long-term thinking and wanting
to bring about more equitable futures. Indeed, Sarah McArthur who de-

An Exercise in Speculative Legal Design  105

scribes herself as a “tinkerer in emergent technology, speculative design
and experiential futures” talks about wanting to be “a good ancestor”.100
She speaks about employing “cathedral thinking”, which is a concept
that recognises that success of a strategy lies not in its implementation,
but in its outcome.101 Like many who worked on the great cathedrals dur-
ing mediaeval times who would never see their completion, speculative
designers are implored to not lose sight of the preferable future they are
aiming for even if that vision isn’t realised within their lifetime. Despite
being challenging, this perspective is key when speculating.

  Designers experimenting with speculative design should also adopt
a bias towards action. Starting somewhere is always better than never
starting. Given the increasing interest in speculative design methods,
there are several databases that are full of useful resources such as
Speculative Edu and Future Scouting,102 which provide practical and ac-
cessible guides and templates that can be followed when starting out.
The increase in numbers of people doing this work also means there are
more conversations taking place and more case studies being produced,
leading to more reflection about how to tackle complicated problems.

  Involving those who are experiencing the problem as designers is also
key, as this enables new perspectives to be included in the discourse re-
lating to some of the most challenging issues facing society. As one par-
ticipant noted on reflection of the speculative legal design experience,
“I think having adults, children, people who feel limitations to equitable
access… write, draw, anything that allows them to visualise what a just
world looks like for them specifically” would be useful as it could “re-
veal barriers that we never [have] seen before”.103 By offering people the
chance to develop the designs themselves, speculative design has the
potential for unleashing a new wave of insights about what futures are
preferable.

106  Emily MacLoud

  Being mindful of the readiness of those participating is also necessary.
Speculative design is a potentially unsafe medium for people who may
have experienced trauma.104 Asking a person to imagine may be danger-
ous as it may mean inviting them to step into a realm where they have
little control. Using language that takes this into account is wise.

  Giving oneself constraints is also helpful. As Jason Tashea recounts
when he was producing the vignettes for the speculative series 40 Fu-
tures: “I only had two rules for writing the pieces. One was that the tech-
nology had to be likely based on what we know today, regardless of how
far down the road it was going to be. And it had to fit in the moral uni-
verse that we currently embody in the United States when it comes to
how we treat people in the criminal justice system.”105 These constraints
ensured the process of generating the fictions was free-flowing and un-
hampered by the hurdles that are commonplace in journalistic and aca-
demic writing.

4.2. The Problem

Choosing the right problem space is also challenging. As Da Gyung Lee
reflects, the first major hurdle she faced was choosing what she would
critique.106 Moreover, because the problems that speculative design calls
into question are often so nebulous and systemic, they can be hard to
define. These problems are often ingrained in the fabric of our society
and understanding their complexities without a clear definition can be a
rather daunting task. But even though the problems that speculative de-
sign focuses on are big, it doesn’t mean the projects have to be big too.
By using simple prompts like “What if…”, imaginations can be ignited,
a plethora of different futures can be conjured up and discussions can
ensue.

  Like other design methods, identifying problems is best achieved by
beginning with thorough research. To demonstrate this inherent com-
plexity, it is useful to consider the lengths Superflux employed when
working with the United Nation Development Program (UNDP) team

to develop Mantis Systems, which is a speculative design that proac-
tively identifies and prevents global systems risks.107 For the project,
they carried out extensive ethnographic research, facilitated workshops
with various practitioners across the development sector, sourced data,
spoke with experts and extrapolated trends, weak signals and uncertain-
ties. This was brought together to inform the world building stage, which
was then used as a launch pad for developing design fictions. This exam-
ple highlights the rigour involved and the types of research that can be
carried out to ensure the speculative designs focus on problems that are
relevant and of concern to the audience of interest.

4.3. The Organisation

Introducing speculative design into a workplace can be challenging for
a number of reasons. Firstly, it’s not typical for design to work in this
way. As noted earlier, design is often thought of as fixing problems that
exist in the present. It follows that creating artefacts in speculative de-
sign projects without context can cause widespread confusion as people
may believe that the designs represent what the organisation is actually
producing or intending to produce. For example, Nick Foster recounts
a project he worked on in which he developed a speculative product,
which was prematurely released and was subsequently interpreted as
a typical ‘product vision’.108 He talks about the anxiety and distress this
caused and highlights the crucial role of commentary alongside these
artefacts to avoid these designs being misinterpreted.

  Secondly, when introducing speculative design into an organisation a
certain level of literacy is required in order for stakeholders to buy-in to
the design process. Yet this can be especially challenging when working
in a highly publicised setting, like government. Within these settings, it’s
not only about getting buy-in from stakeholders within the organisation,
it’s also about “getting across to the community the value of specula-
tive work”.109 This is best done through small structured workshops, as

demonstrated by the work of the Policy Lab, who expertly facilitated sev-
eral sessions to better understand public perceptions about the principle
of open justice.110 Speculative design holds a lot of potential as a design
method, but it often requires significant upfront investment in justifying
why it should be used. It also requires a lot of planning, which can pres-
ent an obstacle in time-poor organisations.

  Thirdly, unique to the legal context, is the consideration of the regu-
latory landscape in which legal entities operate. When considering how
to introduce speculative design into law firms, there is a risk that any
speculative designs may be shut down by the regulators.111 It begs the
question whether there may be a need to set up regulatory sandboxes
that are not just focused on considering the implications of technologies
in the present, but can also extend these so that they can consider the
implications of technologies that don’t yet exist.

5. Conclusion

Employing speculative design in law makes sense for many reasons.
It can be used to critique the status quo; by reimagining what the law
might be, speculative design can spark critical debate about what the
law should be. It can also capture audiences in new ways and make peo-
ple feel differently about the law. By opening up the world of law to new
and larger audiences, speculative design also has the potential to engage
even more people in critical debate. Given the opportunities that this
methodology affords, many pioneers have started experimenting with
speculative design in the legal domain.

  When utilising this approach, it’s important to consider the space, en-
able dialogue and idea association, provide future scenarios or a device
that can snap participants into the future, offer neutral provocations,
enable anonymity so people can contribute freely, and provide a psy-
chologically safe space. Speculative design can make us face our darkest
fears and areas that need attention. It is important to wield this method-
ology respectfully and thoughtfully.

An Exercise in Speculative Legal Design  109

  Speculative design offers a novel way to confront and challenge exist-
ing power structures and systems in the legal domain, allowing for the
exploration of a wide range of possible futures and alignment towards
what is preferable. By engaging with this approach, we can create arte-
facts that help to bridge the gap between our current state and possible
future states and evolve the legal ecosystem into something that works
for everyone.

3. THE POWER OF STORIES TO UNITE, INSPIRE,
AND COLLECTIVELY IMAGINE NEW FUTURES

Emily MacLoud

Abstract
Within the field of law, stories can be a powerful tool. They can help to articulate
how individuals experience the justice system and compel people to take action
by evoking empathy. However, when stories are used reductively in the context
of legal design, such as part of a case study or persona, they can lose their nuance
and the context that surrounds them and may even reinforce harmful stereotypes
or biases. This article will explore the relationship between stories and narratives
and how stories have been used in other sectors to bring people together, inspire
systemic change, and help envision a better future. It will also seek to promote a
systemic sensibility in legal design practitioners, so they can develop stories and
narratives that appreciate the interconnectedness of the systems within which
they operate. The intention of this article is to enable legal practitioners to better
manage complex systems change and to be able to tell stories about it.

1. Introduction

In a recent legal design project, Liz contemplated how to best present the
observations she had witnessed and the opinions she had heard in inter-
views with end-users back to her client. She knew that the data she had
collected was reliable enough to draw meaningful conclusions. However,
she wanted to make sure that this was communicated in a way that en-
abled her audience, the client, to fully comprehend the complexities and
nuances of the insights she had gained. She wanted to express the poten-
tial benefits users would gain as well as the risks involved in proceeding
ahead. She also wanted to warn the client about the implications if her
findings were incorrectly interpreted. She needed a way to communicate
this complexity and make her insights engaging.

  Liz created four behavioural personas that showcased the needs, mo-
tivations and challenges of the target user group. However, she was con-
cerned that these outputs could be forgotten or misused because they
116  Emily MacLoud

were reductionistic and only revealed a small piece of the puzzle. As she
continued to ponder, she realised how the stories she collected from
people she engaged could be misconstrued as a result of transforming
them into personas. As a designer who acted as the conduit between
the target user group and her client, she felt the weight of responsibility
to ensure the stories she told were authentic and truly representative of
the people she had engaged. She felt that it was essential to consider the
implications of storytelling carefully.

Stories are commonly used in the legal domain to articulate the lived
experiences of people involved in the justice ecosystem. They can often
engage the target audience in a way that evidence and reports cannot. In
the story above, Liz is contemplating the implications of using stories as
a tool to communicate the findings from her research. She highlights her
anxiety about the outputs of her work being forgotten, misused or mis-
construed – a concern many designers often grapple with. She ponders
the far-reaching impacts of her work and posits that one must carefully
consider the implications of using specific techniques, such as storytell-
ing, when embarking on design projects. This paper seeks to do just that.

  Recognising that the synergy between law and literature is not new,1
this paper will explore how stories can be powerful devices for commu-
nicating needs, inspiring change, and compelling stakeholders to con-
sider the broader implications of their decisions in the legal context. It
will also expose the shadow side of stories. That is, it will scrutinise what
can go wrong when stories are used reductively by design practitioners,
like in a case study or presented as static personas. When this happens
the subtle complexities of stories and their contexts can be overlooked.
This paper shows how developing a systemic sensibility can be a useful
way to ensure stories fully capture the complexity of the legal domain.
Stories have already been utilised in other industries to tackle issues
from a systemic perspective. It’s time we started using them more often
in the legal domain.

  The article will begin with an overview of systems thinking to enhance
the reader’s systemic sensibility (Section 2). By highlighting examples
where stories have been used reductively, the article will then explore

the complexity of wielding stories in legal settings (Section 3). It will
conclude with a discussion about how stories can be used for systems
change in law (Section 4).

2. Systems Thinking in the Law

2.1. Enhancing Legal Design with Systems Thinking

Applying a systems thinking lens to better understand and make sense
of the legal domain is not new.2 Previous scholars have explored systems
analysis as a methodology and explored different examples of systems
projects,3 why it’s important and how to introduce systems thinking to
law schools through a pedagogical lens,4 and even how to reconfigure
the criminal justice response to human trafficking through a complex-sys-
tems perspective.5 Systems thinking confirms the “tacit understanding”
that the law is both a system and is an element of much broader social
systems.6 The legal domain is an especially pertinent subject for systems
thinking.

   For legal designers, who use design to make the world of law better,
systems thinking can be thought of one of the many designerly mindsets
that they already adopt.7 Once systems thinking is revealed, it is sim-
ilar to “taking the blinders off” as one is able to perceive connections
and relationships between different forces in a refreshed way.8 Systemic
sensibility provides the know-how to be able to “see the water”; that

is, to be able to recognise and describe the often “translucent context”
that gives rise to problems.9 Many legal designers already do this with-
out knowing it. Systemic sensibility gives awareness to this untapped
resource, and systems literacy provides legal designers with enhanced
skills and competencies to address the ever-more complex challenges
that they are being tasked to undertake. With this, legal designers are
then empowered to apply systems thinking in their own work.

2.2. Systemic Sensibility: Introducing Systems Thinking Into a Designers’ Toolkit

The term system can be applied in any context (be it a situation or a pro-
ject) where “items” regularly interact with one another.10 In the legal con-
text, a good example is the criminal justice system. The “items” within
this system include not only the victims, offenders, police, lawyers, and
judges, but also the tangible institutions such as the courts and prisons.11
Systems thinking involves seeing these interdependent groups of items
as relational, rather than linear, that function together in a way that gives
rise to emergent properties.12 Emergent properties can be thought of
as “unexpected behaviours” that materialise as a result of interaction
between the various elements of a system.13 Regardless of the intend-
ed purpose of the system (for example, the purpose of the criminal jus-
tice system is to protect society and its members from criminal activity),
emergent properties can appear unintentionally (for example, arguably
an emergent property of the criminal justice system is that it marginalises
vulnerable groups). These emergent properties are often not caused by
individual players in the system, but because of the way the system oper-

ates. Awareness of this has been described as systemic sensibility, and it
is the first step to developing a systems lens (see Figure 1).

 sensibility, systems literacy and systems thinking in practice capability. © Edson,

   It follows that a system’s behaviour cannot be understood by focusing
on the experience of just one person or one entity within the system.
The system as a whole must be comprehended.15 For legal designers,
this means that they cannot truly grasp the experiences of a group of
people (for example victims or police), without examining the entire sys-
tem. They need to appreciate the wider context in which those people
are situated in order to establish the ways that the system influences
and is influenced by them.
2.3. Systems Literacy: Recognising Different Types of Systems
For legal designers, sharing a language around systems means that com-

monly encountered behaviours and relationships found in systems can
be expressed easily. Recognising that different types of systems exist and
behave in different ways is often the first step to developing this liter-
acy. Dave Snowden’s Cynefin Framework is particularly helpful for this
task (see Figure 2).16 It is a decision framework that helps to identify the
differences between system types and how to respond appropriately.
Disorder occurs when there is no clarity about the type of situation one
is facing.

  In the legal domain, some situations may seem ordered, requiring a
“systematic” response that involves following a step-by-step plan and
engaging in linear thinking. These situations can be described as “sim-

ple” or “complicated” and the recommended approach to tackling these
sorts of problems is to follow “best practice” or “good practice” respec-
tively. An example may be how to approach the situation of charging cli-
ents. Many legal professionals approach this fairly “simple” situation by
adopting “best practice” which dictates that one should track the hours
they work and keep their time entries consistent. This task is often an
assumed part of a lawyer’s everyday practice and for years, many law
firms followed this model. However, as Dave Snowden highlights, there
is a danger in becoming complacent about processes and their success.18
The once “simple” situation can drift towards the “complacency cliff”,
represented in the Cynefin Framework as a ridge between the “simple”
and “chaotic” parts of the diagram. If one is not careful, a simple situ-
ation can easily turn into a crisis that can be very expensive to recover
from.19 As with our example above, many law firms are re-considering
the billable hour and switching to other models like retainers, fixed and
capped fees and event costed litigation, as they recognise that these
pricing models are more practicable for their clients, and prevent their
clients from experiencing nasty surprises that can result in mistrust.20 As
the example above demonstrates, in most situations it is often better,
in the long run, to perceive most situations as complex to prevent the
feeling of complacency.

   Complex systems are “unordered” systems where causality is circular.
The appropriate approach in these situations is to conduct safe experi-
ments to probe the system, make sense of the results of that interven-
tion and amplify it if the experiment succeeds or dampen it if not. This
practice is often called “emergent practice” and involves a constant iter-
ative process of learning and responding to what is learnt.21 The Stanford
Legal Design Lab is carrying out emergent practice as it “researches, de-
signs, and develops new interventions to ensure equal access to justice
for all.”22 In attempting to address the complex access to justice problem,

the Lab is working in the “realm of unknown unknowns” and “unpre-
dictability and flux.”23 They are letting patterns emerge and then help-
fully highlighting these in the form of taxonomies,24 case studies,25 and
pattern libraries.26 Being able to recognise complex systems allows us to
re-frame situations. What might feel like a complicated situation where
a problem-solving framework, like design thinking, can be applied by ex-
perts, may in fact be a complex situation, where we need to employ
emergent practice. For legal designers working in the complex legal sys-
tem, this can be both a liberating and a sobering realisation.

  In contrast, chaotic systems require rapid responses and can be particu-
larly challenging because these situations often lack any sort of recognis-
able patterns that could be used to better understand the relationships
and connections between different parts of the system.27 For example,
the situation that many community legal centres had to contend with in
the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic could be described as chaotic.
These situations required decisive action to be taken that could enable
these organisations to remain open. For example, Speakeasy Law Cen-
tre, a community legal centre operating in Cardiff (Wales), responded to
the chaotic situation by changing its practices overnight and installing
a postbox so that legal papers could be dropped off by members of the
public in a hygienic manner.28 These examples demonstrate how an en-
hanced systemic sensibility can enable the legal designer to approach
situations appropriately and how vastly different the approaches need
to be. This further underscores the importance of being able to identify
when a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient and when a more tai-
lored approach is necessary.

   In addition to recognising different system types, a shared language
regarding the different components of systems is particularly useful
for legal designers for they can be a way to describe concepts that are
sometimes difficult to explain or non-obvious. It is outside the scope of
this article, but a good understanding of the concepts of self-organisa-
tion, emergent behaviour, context and information flow is useful for it
can enhance a legal designer’s ability to recognise what system they are
embedded within and how to make sense of what might be happen-
ing within the system. This also enables the legal designer to tell stories
about systems that can encapsulate complexity easily and simply.

3. Storytelling in the Law

3.1. How Legal Designers Use Stories

If systems thinking is how a legal designer can think about the situations
that they come across, storytelling is how a legal designer can describe
what is happening. Storytelling is an integral part of a legal designer’s
toolkit. As a method, stories can be used by legal designers to elicit con-
textual information,29 or when utilised as a part of “Anecdote Circles”,
which involves supporting a group of people to engage in a discussion
relating to a set of themes, they can be used in a group setting to “reveal
insights one could never predict from the outset.”30 Stories can also be a
way to share insights from user research activities, and when done well
can make the problems relatable and inspire action.31 But when used
poorly, they can be at best unmemorable and at worst lead to misrep-

resentation about the subject of the story. In this section, we will focus
on the way stories are used to share insights from research activities,
and explore the way legal designers typically use stories for this purpose
and the pitfalls to which they are often susceptible.

  Personas are a great tool for communicating the needs, motivations
and challenges of research subjects. They provide a useful framework
for organising and visualising user research data in a meaningful way,
helping to identify patterns, similarities, and differences in the behav-
iour and attitudes of the people being studied. Personas provide a way
to bring user research data to life, helping to create an image of the
user with specific traits, needs, and motivations. Often represented as
cards, with a profile of a fictional character and relevant demographic
and behavioural information alongside it, personas seek to encapsulate
the research data and present it in a way that’s memorable.32

  However, as Kim Salazer points out “these are just the representations
of personas… What you really want is to get personas off the paper and
into the minds of your colleagues. You want personas to be naturally and
organically referenced in every discussion and decision that is made.”33
If not utilised well, personas run the risk of remaining static artefacts.
Personas also run the risk of being reductive to the point that they focus
on only the aspects that are relevant to the product, service or system
rather than encapsulating the whole person and their context. This can
lead to a single-dimensional view of a user and result in a lack of under-
standing of the complexities and nuances of the user’s experience.

  Case studies are also used by legal designers to share knowledge and
experiences from successful projects, and to celebrate success with col-
leagues and peers. Through this form of collaboration, legal designers
can learn from each other and improve their practice. However, the lack
of them may also misrepresent what is happening in reality. As one Le-
galTech commentator raised in a recent post on social media, she was
unsure whether the definition of legal design had narrowed due to a
recent trend she had observed where proponents were mainly focused

on the design of contracts.34 She made this assumption based on the
number of case studies that had been published that showcased the
success of these projects. Moreover, how the success is shared is often
questionable. Many of these case studies, developed by private compa-
nies, are not genuinely shared or data about their evaluation is not made
available.35 Yet, this is simply a misrepresentation of the work that is
happening in this space. Arguably, one of the reasons why we may hear
about contract design projects is that it’s often easier to write about
these projects as they can be neatly packaged up and produce tangible
results. Another possible reason is that contract design is one of the first
“cribs” of legal design. Information design projects in this field were the
first ones to be developed and not just within the confines of “legal de-
sign” rhetoric. Why are case studies about systemic change so few and
far between? How might we write stories that encapsulate these hard-
to-define inputs and outputs?

3.2. Using Stories for Systems Change

Stories are especially powerful devices for presenting the complexity
found within systems. For the rest of this article, we will explore the way
that stories can be used as a device to not only drive systems change but
also help to shine a light on the way systems change.36 Inspired by the
work of Thea Snow and others,37 the focus of this article will be looking
at how legal designers can use stories for systems change to engage both
hearts and minds.

  The definition of systems change that we will use is that offered by the
UK think tank and consultancy for the social sector, New Philanthropy
Capital (NPC): “Systems change aims to bring about lasting change by
altering underlying structures and supporting mechanisms which make
the system operate in a particular way. These can include policies, rou-
tines, relationships, resources, power structures and values.”38 This defi-
nition is useful as it captures both the intent behind systems change (the
what) as well as possible ways to bring about systems change (the how).

  It is well known that changes in how systems function are unlikely until
“a critical mass of people hold a particular view and the system reaches
a tipping point”.39 Stories and messages are often viewed as the most
effective way at engaging a critical mass of people to alter these underly-
ing structures and supporting mechanisms. This has been recognised by
many community organisations, like the First Nations collective Passing
the message stick, which is on a mission to change the mainstream nar-
rative about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.40 They speak
about the importance of repetition: “when we all use the same effective
messages we can shift public support and win a transformative policy
agenda.”41 Groups like Passing the message stick are creating change in
their communities by disrupting the predominant narrative. It is through
narrative change that systems can change. We explore the interplay be-
tween narrative and stories and worldviews below.

  Stories have the potential to contribute significantly to systemic
change. They can inspire and move people to action, and can be a pow-
erful tool for social and political transformation. However, there are also
several intrinsic and extrinsic limits to the impact of storytelling. One of
the intrinsic limits is the fact that stories are often subjective and can be
interpreted in different ways by different people. This can sometimes
lead to misunderstandings and confusion, which can limit the ability
of stories to bring about change. Additionally, many stories are limited

by their form or medium. Certain types of stories, such as those found
within case studies, may not have the time or space to fully explore
complex issues or ideas. Extrinsic limits to the impact of storytelling in-
clude factors such as access and distribution. Stories that are not widely
available or that are not promoted effectively may not reach their in-
tended audience, and may therefore have limited impact. Additionally,
the cultural and political context in which stories are presented can also
limit their impact. Stories that challenge the status quo or that promote
marginalised perspectives may face resistance or backlash from those in
power.

3.3. The Interplay Between Stories and Narratives

One of the key aspects of stories that are about systems change is that
they can often be presented as disconnected or random, but when sewn
together, an underlying narrative can form. The Narrative Initiative has
crystallised this concept in their Waves model that eloquently explains
the components of deep narrative change.42 The framework clearly sets
out the dynamics between messages, stories, narratives, worldviews and
values (see Figure 3). It uses a very simple metaphor of a wave driven by
a current to explain the interplay between values and worldviews and
how they drive a narrative. It expands this metaphor to also consider
how stories and messages, which can feel independent and disorderly,
are often driven by narratives, just as the ocean’s surface, which can feel
disorientating and unpredictable, is largely driven by what is happening
underneath.

42 Narrative Initiative, ‘Waves: A model for deep narrative change’ (Narrative Initi-
     ative 8 July 2020) <https://narrativeinitiative.org/blog/waves-a-model-for-deep-
     narrative-change/> accessed 5 February 2023.

3.3.1. Messages and Stories
Just like the ocean surface that is subject to the whim of the environ-
ment, like a gusty wind, stories and messages are often reactive to the
environment. Being surface-level, it is usually what we see when we look
out at the ocean and we can be mistaken to believe that that is all there
is to the ocean. The ocean’s surface, much like stories and messages, is
accessible. We can see stories and messages floating on the surface, and
if we are not careful, we may not appreciate what lies beneath.

  As Fleurie Forbes-Martin, Story & Growth Director at Stronger Stories,
describes, “the three principles that we always share are the strongest
stories are the ones people already tell themselves; the only thing that
can replace that story is a stronger one; and it takes 1,000 stronger sto-
ries to change the narrative.”44 The Lean Story Canvas is an effective tool

     (Virtual, 24 January 2023).
The Power of Stories to Unite, Inspire, and Collectively Imagine... 129

for building an effective story.45 The Canvas contains nine building blocks
that aims to help the user refine the target group or individual, the envi-
ronment, the behaviour that stands in the way of change, the trigger for
change, what the first step will look like and so on. It is crucial to think
carefully about what story is going to be appropriate for the message
one is trying to convey and the environment in which it will be received.
When crafting stories, it is important to consider whether the environ-
ment is conducive to smooth sailing or whether it will be treacherous
high seas.

3.3.2. Narratives
Narratives infuse stories with deeper meaning. Identifying the predom-
inant narratives is one of the key steps that Stronger Stories takes when
first working with a client.46 Like waves, they influence what happens on
the surface level, but they are often unnoticeable on the water’s surface.
Narratives are a constellation of stories related to one another, held to-
gether by a common thread. By analysing these narratives we can start
to identify the values and worldviews that underpin them.

3.3.3. Values and Worldviews
Values and worldviews are deeply embedded in our cultures. They are
the currents that drive the waves that influence what we see on the sur-
face of the ocean. They are the beliefs that we each hold, unknowingly
or not. These beliefs shape how we interpret what we see and what we
hear. Often described as a lens, they inform how we see ourselves, our
communities and others. Forbes-Martin from Stronger Stories highlights
that for their team, they’ve learned that making stories relatable isn’t
through demographics, it’s by… speaking directly to the values that drive
people.47

   The Waves model can be used as a tool to assist legal designers think
about what stories they want to tell and what may be influencing these
stories and describe how narratives are influenced by deeply held be-
liefs. It can also provide legal designers with a way to work with their

clients to articulate and identify dominant narratives and replace these
with their desired ones. It’s a useful framework for legal designers seek-
ing to engage in more storytelling in their practice.

4. Application to Real Life

Now that we’ve better understood how systems thinking and storytell-
ing can be applied in the law, it’s time to get practical. How might we use
stories for systems change? Underlying this next section is the under-
standing that stories bring about change because they operate at two
levels simultaneously. At the individual level, they help people to build
empathy, shift their mindsets and see new possibilities through discus-
sion and debate.48 Systems can only change when people change. Stories
can act as a powerful catalyst for people to reframe how they see them-
selves and how they relate to others.49 At the system level, stories can
play a role in “reshaping the rules of the systems” and articulating how
systems are changing.50 Stories can help to make sense of the current
landscape and how it has been shaped by the forces that have acted
upon it. They can also provide insights into how the system is evolving
and how it may look in the future, helping to create a shared under-
standing of the changes that are taking place.

  An analysis of good stories highlights several common features: good
stories are known for being “resonant, clear and relatable”, and “guided
and bound by agreed protocols”.51 Good stories resonate emotionally
with the listener, conveying a sense of relatability. They are persuasive
and engaging because they connect on a deeper level than mere data
points can provide. They avoid academic language and instead offer au-
thentic, inclusive and gentle language. They can also provide more con-
text than numbers alone because they can tap into past experiences and
emotions through literary tools like analogies and metaphors.

4.1. Learning From Other Sectors

Systemic narratives have already been utilised in other industries to
tackle issues from a systemic perspective. These unique stories provide
a platform for people to come together, to find common ground, to be
inspired and motivated, and to create a shared vision for the future. Sys-
temic narratives can be used to draw attention to the complexity of a
particular issue, to help to make sense of it, and to provide a framework
for collective action. They can help to shift perspectives, to open up pos-
sibilities, and to create an environment where new solutions can be im-
agined and explored. Ultimately, these stories have the power to bring
people together, to unify them, and to help them to develop a shared
vision of what the future could look like.

   A good example of a systemic narrative is the Doughnut. Kate Raworth
developed the Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries in 2017, as
a “playfully serious approach to framing the challenge of balancing life’s
essentials (like clean water and food) to overshooting our pressure on
Earth’s life-supporting systems” (Figure 4).52 This simple concept has
captured the essence of the Sustainable Development Goals and trans-
formed it into a story that has awakened the imaginations of commu-
nities across the world. For example, in Melbourne, Australia, Regen
Melbourne has co-created the local Melbourne Doughnut (Figure 5),
which has been augmented to accommodate Melbourne’s unique char-
acter, problems and opportunities.53 Crucially, the Melbourne Dough-
nut is “organic and alive” and will be shaped as the Regen Melbourne
community uses it and contributes to it. As Forbes-Martin from Stronger
Stories warns, “stories are living and messy things that constantly evolve
and change”.54 By remaining “open”, this can foster the conditions for
people to inject new thoughts and ideas into stories, apply them in dif-
ferent contexts and keep them sustainable.

54 Forbes-Martin (n 44).
132  Emily MacLoud

  Legal designers can learn a thing or two from the humble Doughnut.
First, it has enabled the transformation of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) from largely disparate goals into a simplified concise form.
What if we took the principles and goals of the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and made sense of them in an easy to remember
diagram? It’s likely this may make the principles more memorable and
therefore, applied more readily. Second, the Doughnut has transitioned
the SDGs focus away from growth, to balance.55 The Doughnut does this
by placing an ecological ceiling on each of the SDGs and highlighting
when ecosystems are at risk of being unable to sustain our resource con-
sumption. For legal designers, what if we were able to place some visual
boundaries on the criminal justice system? What if we could visualise
how the system must strike a balance between retributive justice and
restorative justice. Third, the Doughnut has made sense of this complex
space in a way that is easy to absorb and talk about. The simple use of
red and green to signal whether a particular jurisdiction is either over-
shooting or underperforming with respect to the SDGs makes it clear
where effort should be put and what problems should be tackled as a
priority. Legal designers can wield their visual design skills in a similar
way to pinpoint what is important and what can be deprioritised.

4.2. How Might We Use Stories for Systems Change in the Law?

The focus of this article is to inspire the use of more stories that can be
used within the justice space. A good example of using systemic narra-
tive in the legal space is the work of The Chancery Lane Project (TCLP).
TCLP is an ambitious collaborative initiative, which brings together close
to 3000 legal and industry professionals across the globe in order to ad-
dress climate change.56

Working in close partnership, these professionals use their expertise
to create new and practical contractual clauses which can be easily in-
corporated into law firm precedents and commercial agreements to
provide long-term climate solutions.57 Through this initiative, they are
utilising their deep understanding of the complexities of legal systems,
contracts and markets, and harnessing these to achieve meaningful and
sustainable systemic environmental change. Stories play a key role in in-
spiring professionals to join in. Ben Metz, Executive Director, talks about
the “aha moment” him and his team had at the beginning of TCLP where
it dawned on them that they should start using stories: “we had this
idea of riffing off superheroes because lawyers are mild-mannered Clark
Kents… and underneath great responsibility comes a great power but
just nobody’s tapping into it.”58 This storyline runs through all of their
work. As a next step, Metz also shares that an ambition he has is to cre-

ate an origin story template that would act as the source material for the
drafting of a clause that could be used by a lawyer, and then the relevant
elements could be adapted to be used by a congressperson to create the
wraparound narrative and story. This initiative is yet to commence, but
it sounds promising. By using stories, TCLP has tapped into the rich re-
source of lawyers operating in very different capacities across the world
and is incrementally bringing about the change needed to address the
very large complex wicked problem: climate change.

4.3. What’s Next?

As alluded to above, legal designers are already using stories in multi-
ple ways. By augmenting client-generated stories with observation and
empathy, client stories are no longer at the centre of the legal design
process.59 Instead, their needs are. Arguably this enhances the client
narratives as they can be more fully realised through the expansive pro-
cess of legal design. Yet, there is also an inherent risk in making sense of
the stories we hear and transforming these into representative artefacts,
as legal designers each hold a set of biases that are sometimes hard to
discern. Whenever possible, stories should be told in the language and
voice of the community being represented.60 Power should be placed in
the hands of story-holders. They must be able to decide which stories
should be told and how they should be narrated.

  With the advance of ChatGPT, AI presents a new frontier for telling
stories. Stronger Stories are exploring how AI compares to what they
can produce from “a place of intuition and experience and, you know,
heart.”61 Forbes-Martin suspects that AI will struggle to identify what it
is about story building blocks that resonate. While AI can parse through
data and produce helpful insights, it cannot yet capture the complexity
of what really drives people to engage with a story in a meaningful way.
That’s where legal designers come in.

   ChatGPT may also be biassed and can produce fake results.62 In in-
stances where accuracy and impartiality are crucial, this can be particu-
larly concerning. For example, if legal designers were to start building a
conversational chatbot based on data that exists about decisions made
in the courts, there are several reasons why this might pose issues. The
large datasets that are required to develop chatbots like this may be
trained on biassed data that may lead to biassed outputs that can per-
petuate systemic inequalities. Moreover, it may not be possible to ac-
count for the nuances and complexities of legal decision-making, which
could lead to inaccurate or incomplete information being provided to
users. When developing and implementing ChatGPT in legal contexts, it
is crucial to carefully consider the potential risks and drawbacks of this
technology.

5. Conclusion

After Liz had researched how stories from other sectors had been used
to bring about change, she decided to apply the same techniques to the
law. She realised that good stories needed to be guided and bound by
protocols, and that stories about systems change needed to embrace
nonlinear, dynamic and more fluid forms. She also learned the impor-
tance of making sure the stories were resonant, warm and relatable, and
that they should not be used to promote any agenda or to claim any kind
of dominance.

   The legal designer was determined to ensure that the stories she told
would be honest, authentic, and inclusive. She wanted to make sure that
it was story-holders who had the power to decide which stories should
be told, and how they should be told. With a newfound understanding
of the power of stories, she was ready to start telling stories that would
enable systemic change in the legal domain.

  She began by creating stories about the lived experiences of individ-
uals within the justice system to communicate their needs and push for
change. She used empathy to understand their motivations and feelings,
allowing her to create a more holistic narrative that captured the nu-
ances of the situation. She also applied a systems thinking lens to ensure
that the nuance and complexity of the system in which the individuals
operated within was captured.

  Through her stories, she brought people together and helped them
envision a better future. People began to understand the implications of
their actions and make decisions that would create more equitable and
accessible legal systems. Using the Doughnut as inspiration, she created
a visualisation of the complex legal landscape and provided her client
with a way to talk about the problems they were encountering. Her sto-
ries had a ripple effect, inspiring systemic change and transforming the
landscape incrementally.

We often hear the cry “We need systems change” to refer to the need
to address the many complex and interconnected problems we face in
today’s society. From climate change to systemic bias held against mar-
ginalised groups, the need to address these systemic problems is urgent
now more than ever. As society is fragmenting down societal, economic,
and political boundaries, finding ways to identify and align around how
to shift these complex systems forward is crucial. In the passage above,
Liz’s reflections are a reminder that stories can be powerful tools to bring
about change, and that by wielding stories well, we can create a better
future.

  Systems thinking offers not only enhanced awareness about these of-
ten nonobvious forces but also provides the tools to map these forces,
bring them to light and help people to identify where to intervene for
the greatest impact. By developing an awareness of the larger social,
economic and political systems in which people and entities are embed-
ded, legal designers can gain a deeper insight into the broader implica-
tions of their work.

  Combining systems thinking with storytelling enables legal designers
to be equipped to express the complex situations that they are design-
ing within. By looking at the problem from a holistic perspective, legal
designers can gain a better understanding of the interconnections that
The Power of Stories to Unite, Inspire, and Collectively Imagine... 137

exist between the various elements of the situation, providing a com-
prehensive overview and enabling them to bring about the desired out-
come.

COUNTERNARRATIVES ABOUT PEOPLE POWER

Hallie Jay Pope

Abstract
When ordinary people exercise their collective power, they can disrupt and even
dismantle systems of elite rule. But in recent decades, the American Left has
moved away from organising strategies that regard ordinary people as the authors
of their own liberation, instead favouring shallower mobilisation tactics that accept
elite rule as incontestable. This shift has coincided with the rollback of many of the
progressive victories won by the labour and civil rights movements. How might
design methods support a resurgence of deep, transformative organising efforts?
This paper will explore critical play as a method for fostering faith in ordinary-peo-
ple power.

1. Introduction

Legal designers concerned with dismantling oppressive systems must
reckon with today’s political reality. Over the past few decades, the cor-
porate class in the United States has systematically dismantled many of
the gains of the labour and civil rights movements. Economic inequality
is deepening, reactionary politics are resurging, and substantial progres-
sive victories are few and far between. Union organiser and scholar Jane
McAlevey attributes this trajectory to the Left’s shift in strategy “away
from deep organizing and toward shallow mobilizing.”1

  Mobilising and organising are rooted in two very different theories
about the power of “ordinary people” (a term McAlevey borrows from
sociologist and activist Frances Fox Piven). Mobilising depends on large
numbers of ordinary people to participate in campaigns for change, but
in a shallow way, reserving meaningful control for professional staffers.
This approach rests on the assumption that elite rule is inevitable, that

     2016) 2.

the best we can hope for is to replace bad elites with friendlier elites.2
Organising, on the other hand, “places the agency for success with a
continually expanding base of ordinary people,” and seeks “to transfer
power from the elite to the majority.”3 This approach “assumes that
the very idea of who holds power is itself contestable,”4 and reflects an
understanding that ordinary-people power is essential for meaningful
transformation.

  Successful organising requires getting ordinary people to recognize
and believe in their own power, to reject the notion that the status quo
is inevitable; only then will they put their jobs and bodies on the line to
fight the corporate elite. It also requires professional activists, lawyers,
and other allied “elites” to understand that ordinary people can and
should hold power; only then will they wield their own power in solidar-
ity and relinquish it to ordinary people whenever possible. How might
we change the way we conceive of our own power and the power of oth-
ers? We use narratives to make sense of our experiences and ourselves.5
Fostering a belief in ordinary-people power necessitates the creation of
counterstories that challenge the dominant narrative of elite power.

  This paper will investigate critical play as a tool for reimagining power,
with the aim of contributing to a fruitful mindset for movement organis-
ing. Part I examines the transformative role of ordinary-people power—
and belief in this power—in the context of two pivotal moments in
American history: the labour movement in the 1930s, and the civil rights
movement in the 1960s. Part II argues that efforts to cultivate belief in
ordinary-people power will benefit from the generation of counternarra-
tives, stories that challenge our shared latent understandings of elite
power. Finally, Part III explores critical play as one potential method for
generating and engaging with counternarratives about ordinary-people
power. This paper builds on my previous exploration of convoking radical
imagination in the context of liberatory legal design projects.6 Can play-

ful immersion in counternarratives contest the inevitability of elite rule
and inspire faith in the power of ordinary people?

2. Why Ordinary-people Power Matters

McAlevey begins No Shortcuts with an observation that is sobering for
anyone striving for collective liberation in the United States: “Many of
the biggest victories of the past 100 years, those won in the heyday of
the labour and civil rights movements, have been all but rolled back.”7
To be fair, many wins from this era remain embedded in American struc-
tures and cultures—so much so that we take them for granted and for-
get that they were born of mass struggles.8 But through a decades-long
multifront campaign, corporate interests have ushered in a new gilded
age, one marked by privatisation, deregulation, mass incarceration, vot-
er suppression, and immense income and wealth inequality.9

  How did we get here? “Why were the achievements won during the
heyday of the pre-McCarthy labour movement and the civil rights move-
ment so substantial compared with the progressive achievements of the
past forty years?”10 McAlevey argues that truly significant and durable
movement victories have historically resulted—and indeed, can only
result—from the agency and power of ordinary people.11 Specifically,
these gains stem from the threat or exercise of large-scale disruptive
power, like strikes, when ordinary people leverage their ability “to dis-
rupt a pattern of ongoing and institutionalized cooperation that depends
on their continuing contributions.”12

  McAlevey attributes the Left’s diminished capacity and willingness to
exercise disruptive power to a shift in strategy from organising to mobi-
lising. Organising relies on the “involvement of specific, large numbers of
people whose power is derived from their ability to withdraw labour or
other cooperation from those who rely on them.”13 Organising ordinary
people who possess disruptive power creates the capacity to engage in
mass tactics like strikes and sustained nonviolent direct action, tactics
that led to the significant victories of the 1930s labour movement and
1960s civil rights movement. Mobilising, by contrast,14 focuses on corpo-
rate campaigns led by professional staff or volunteer activists and aimed
at generating media attention, influencing policy makers, and ultimately
pressuring employers to make reforms. While such campaigns do require
large numbers of people to participate, “it matters little who shows up,
or, why, as long as a sufficient number of bodies appear—enough for a
photo good enough to tweet and maybe generate earned media.”15 Un-
der this strategy, staffers are the key agents, and ordinary people with
disruptive power, like workers, are simply useful “messengers” for the
staffers’ vision of change.16

  According to McAlevey, these two different strategies stem from two
competing progressive theories of power.17 The dominant mobilising
model assumes that elite power is unchallengeable.18 Subscribers to this
theory seek to effect change by replacing “a very naughty elite with a
‘better’ elite, one they ‘can work with’” to improve conditions for or-
dinary people.19 The ruling class—or what McAlevey dubs the “priest-
ly-kingly-corporate class”20—will always be the ruling class, and the best
change-makers can strive for is to make their rule more palatable. This

     support of their overarching strategy of building and exercising mass disruptive
     power.

17 McAlevey notes that most liberals also share the belief that elite rule is inevitable.
     For liberals, this theory supports an advocacy model. For progressives, it underpins
     a mobilising model.

theory of power relegates ordinary people to the peripheral; in a mobi-
lisation strategy, workers are merely one point of leverage among many
against the inexorable power-holders. In other words, “[w]orkers are no
longer essential to their own liberation.”21

  The organising model, on the other hand, rests on a belief that “the
very idea of who holds power is itself contestable.”22 As Piven puts it,
“the widely held thesis that power is based on control of wealth and
force explains a good deal of our experience. But it does not explain all
of our experience.”23 Rule by elites might feel inevitable, but an examina-
tion of our own history proves that their power is not absolute. Ordinary
people hold a “vast potential power,” the power to disrupt society and
create change.24 Adherents to this theory view ordinary people as “the
primary agents of their own liberation.”25 This is why ordinary people are
central to the organising strategy; the ultimate goal is “to transfer power
from the elite to the majority,”26 a majority “anchored in deep…solidari-
ties and cooperative engagement in class struggle.”27

2.1. Ordinary-people Power in Action

Movement scholar Charles M. Payne provides a detailed illustration of
how ordinary-people power shaped civil rights activism in 1960s Missis-
sippi. The civil rights movement held “two distinct traditions,” traditions
that parallel McAlevey’s mobilising-organising dichotomy.28 The “com-
munity-mobilizing tradition” epitomised by Martin Luther King “focused
on large-scale, relatively short-term public events” like the March on
Washington.29 The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)’s
voter registration efforts in Mississippi, on the other hand, “reflect[ed]

another tradition of Black activism, one of community organising, a tra-
dition with a different sense of what freedom means and therefore a
greater emphasis on the long-term development of leadership in ordi-
nary men and women.”30 In Payne’s estimation, SNCC’s organising efforts
during the early 1960s were “sufficiently transformative—empowering,
if you will—that local people who had become active in that period were
able to create and sustain several movement-related institutions, even
in the face of decreasing help from…outside organizers.”31

  The community organising tradition in Mississippi stemmed largely
from the philosophies and practices of Septima Clark, Myles Horton, and
Ella Baker. These activists and educators shared a belief that ordinary
people can and must be the authors of their own liberation. All three dis-
trusted top-down organisations and leaders who had separate interests
from the communities they claimed to serve.32 As Baker put it, “strong
people don’t need strong leaders”: an effective leader would be more of
a teacher than a decision-maker, developing the leadership capacities of
others through participatory politics.33

  SNCC drew deeply from this organising framework when it set about
registering Black voters in Mississippi. In 1962, SNCC organisers drafted
a plan that “Ella Baker or Septima Clark could have written,” stressing
the importance of developing local leadership and using registration
as “a means to the more important end of getting people politically in-
volved.”34 Organisers facilitated opportunities for community members
to take on tasks “they didn’t think themselves ‘qualified’ to handle”—
convincing others to vote, speaking at community meetings, engaging in
demonstrations, and making decisions about the movement’s direction
and strategy—and “creat[ed] an atmosphere in which people fe[lt] free
to make mistakes and try again.”35 SNCC began using voter registration
as an opportunity to build Black Mississippians’ capacity and self-de-
termination in the early sixties. By the mid-sixties, “defiance of white

supremacy had been institutionalized.”36 And by the late sixties, towns
like Greenwood, Mississippi were home to numerous political initiatives
developed and run by local folks who “carried on the struggle even as
direct influence of SNCC was waning.”37

  Reliance on ordinary-people power also underpinned the Congress of
Industrial Organization (CIO)’s successful workplace organising efforts
in the early twentieth century. Founded in 1935, the CIO rejected the
dominant organising philosophy of the time and built power “across the
many ‘isms’” by organizing workers of all skill-levels, races, genders, and
ethnicities.38 The CIO’s president, John Lewis, was anti-communist and
anti-socialist, but he was forced to rely on leftist organizers because they
were the best at what they did. According to McAlevey, unions “led by
leftist factions were not only the most effective but also the most demo-
cratic.”39 Their members fought for control over production, not just for
material gains, and successful organizing efforts “resulted in high-quality
contracts that cemented a high level of participation, active member-
ship, and a strong relationship between the rank and file and union lead-
ers.”40 In these early days of the CIO, “[s]trikes…were routine, and were
evidence that workers themselves were the primary agents of their own
liberation.”41

  Today, organisers who still follow the CIO model continue to empha-
sise identifying, recruiting, and developing “organic leaders” who al-
ready hold the respect of their fellow workers. Early in an organising
effort, these organic leaders must persuade others to join them in high-
risk displays of union support—like signing a petition or wearing a union
sticker to work—with each successive demonstration not only proving
the leader’s capability, but also facilitating mass involvement and build-
ing the workers’ confidence in their collective power.42 Workers who

come to understand their own agency in this way are empowered not
only to challenge elite power themselves, but to “unite their workplace
and community relationships into a single struggle for decency and re-
spect.”43 This kind of worker-centred organising is rare in our era of mobi-
lisation, but nursing home workers in New England, teachers in Chicago,
and factory workers in North Carolina have all successfully employed
“whole worker”44 organising tactics to strike and win, building and exer-
cising ordinary-people power within and beyond the workplace.45

  While mobilising might achieve limited victories, it cannot deliver us
from this new gilded age. Only organising—placing “the primary agency
for success on an ever-expanding base of ordinary people”46—can gener-
ate the disruptive power necessary to challenge elite rule.

2.2. Believing in Ordinary-people Power

When it comes to social change, “the actual limits of what is achievable
depend in part on the beliefs people hold about what sorts of alterna-
tives are viable.”47 We see this understanding reflected in both Payne’s
and McAlevey’s accounts, which emphasise that a key part of successful
mass organising is cultivating a belief in ordinary-people power. The leg-
acy of organisers like Clark and Baker was “a faith that ordinary people
who learn to believe in themselves are capable of extraordinary acts.”48
For SNCC activists in Mississippi, “whether a community achieved this or
that tactical objective was likely to matter less than whether the people
in it came to see themselves as having the right and the capacity to have
some say-so in their own lives.”49 They measured success not by voter
registration numbers, but by the cultivation of a sense of self-determi-
nation in the communities they organised.50 “SNCC preached a gospel
of individual efficacy. What you do matters. In order to move politically,

49 ibid 68.
50 ibid 318.
Solidarity by Design: Generating Counternarratives...  149

people had to believe that.”51
  Similarly, in the labour context, McAlevey observes that “[l]arge num-

bers of people transition from unthinking ‘masses’ or ‘the grassroots’
or ‘the workers’ to serious and highly invested actors exercising agency
when they come to see, to understand, and to value” their own power.52
In workplace organising, believing in ordinary-people power is often a
precursor to exercising it collectively. By deciding to participate in a dis-
ruptive action like a strike, a worker puts her livelihood at risk; such a
risk is worthwhile only if she believes that she and her fellow workers
have the power to prevail.53 This sentiment is echoed in a list of advice
circulated among union organisers: “Workers united can beat the boss.
You have to believe that and so do they.”54

  That phrasing—”You have to believe that and so do they”—reveals
that faith in ordinary-people power should extend beyond the people
most directly affected by a problem of subordination, beyond the people
directly participating in disruptive action. The ultimate purpose of organ-
ising is to take power from the 1%, the priestly-kingly-corporate elites,
and transfer it to the 99%, the majority.55 But the 99% includes people
with a wide range of proximity to subordination and to elite privilege.
People who are ideologically aligned with movement goals but who hold
institutional or class-based power—professional activists, policymakers,
and lawyers, for instance—can hamper organising efforts by consoli-
dating their own power, or they can help facilitate the conditions for
a bottom-up swell towards liberation. McAlevey notes that the labour
movement’s strategic shift from organising to mobilising can be blamed,
at least in part, on “the people controlling the movement’s resources—
the individuals who are decision makers in national unions and in philan-
thropy.”56 What if these decision makers’ imaginations were not limited
to the search for “friendly elites”? What if they believed in the power
and right of those they “serve” to lead their own efforts to dismantle the
status quo?

  Part of the Mississippi organisers’ task was getting wealthier commu-
nity members to identify with their poor neighbours, and to understand
that poor people had the capability and the right to lead themselves
rather than being “led by their betters.”57 Activists like Baker, Clark, and
Horton believed that “[e]veryone has a contribution to make”:

     “The organizer has to be aware of class exploitation, sensitive to class
     snobbery, without losing sight of the potential contribution to be
     made by those who do succumb to it. Just as one has to be able to
     look at a sharecropper and see a potential teacher, one must be able
     to look at a conservative lawyer and see a potential crusader for ju-
     stice.”58

  Solidarity rooted in recognition of ordinary people’s agency can not
only encourage the democratic redistribution of power within the move-
ment, but also channel broader community support into organising ef-
forts. If more of us come to believe in the power of ordinary people, we
may set the stage for a self-fulfilling prophecy of grassroots liberation.

3. Why We Need Counternarratives about Ordinary-people Power

How do we cultivate belief in ordinary-people power? In particular, how
do we inspire this faith among people whose existing beliefs and previ-
ous experiences contradict it?

  We form our beliefs about ourselves and the world through our expe-
riences.59 It makes sense, then, that ordinary people can come to believe
in their own power by experiencing their collective agency for them-

59 I went down a bit of a rabbit hole trying to understand how this process actually

     happens in our brains. When we have an experience our neurons fire, and the
     synapses between neurons release chemicals that activate other neurons. Un-
     der certain conditions—which I’ll get to in Part III—this neural firing can actual-
     ly strengthen the synaptic connections between neurons, which is how we learn
     from experience. Although we’re more open to learning from experience when
     our brains are young and still developing, our brains retain the ability to change—
     known as neuroplasticity—throughout our lives. Daniel J Siegel, Mindsight: The

selves. This understanding lay at the heart of the organising strategy in
Mississippi. People experienced their individual and collective self-de-
termination through “participatory political and educational activities,
in which the people themselves ha[d] a part in defining the problems…
and solving them.”60 Leaders like Septima Clark and others who ran the
Highlander Folk School developed their faith in ordinary-people power
“[t]hrough long experience working with impoverished communities,”
during which they witnessed first-hand “the ability of communities of
the poor to provide much of the leadership for their own struggle.”61
Legal scholar Stephen Wexler makes a similar connection between expe-
riencing and believing in ordinary-people power:

     “If the lawyer negotiates the settlement of a dispute, the people will
     see, if anything, only that one lawyer can beat another. If the people
     confront those who oppose them and win, they see that they can beat
     those whom they will inevitably oppose again. That lesson is more
     valuable than anything the lawyer can win, or any ease in his style of
     victory.”62

  But power is an abstract and complex concept. How do we make sense
of our experiences with power, and why do we draw certain lessons and
beliefs from them rather than others? Cognitive linguist George Lakoff
argues that we understand ourselves and each other through narrative
frames.63 In other words, when we are learning from experience, we
are encoding a story in our brains about how various events, ideas, and
emotions connect.64 We combine simple narratives into more complex
ones, and we share our narratives with each other through storytelling
and other cultural exchange.65 We apply culturally shared “deep narra-
tives”—roles like the Hero, the Villain, the Victim, and the Helper—to our
experiences, giving meaning to our lives and the lives of those around

us.66 To an extent, we even experience others’ narratives as our own.67
When we see or experience something, there is rarely one true under-
standing of it. We must impose meaning with storytelling. “We partici-
pate in creating what we see in the very act of describing it.”68

  This means that narratives are central to how we understand power,
our own and others. And the cultural “deep narrative” about power in
America, the dominant story, is that elite rule is inevitable. Sure, we have
shared stories about “ordinary” people transcending overwhelming odds,
but these stories hinge on the idea that the “ordinary” person is actually
extraordinary in some way: hardworking, virtuous, talented. The hero of
the Rags-to-Riches narrative doesn’t band together with other poor peo-
ple to overthrow the rich; she does something exceptional to become
one of them.69 Even our shared narratives about bottom-up movements
for social transformation tend to lionise—and sanitise—exceptional in-
dividuals, like Martin Luther King. As Payne puts it, the achievements of
ordinary people during the civil rights movement “seem extraordinary to
us precisely because we have such an impoverished sense of the capabil-
ities of ordinary people.”70

  These dominant narratives that conflate power with extraordinariness
reinforce our understanding that elite rule is inevitable, and at the same
time they limit our moral imaginations of a better world to a world with
friendlier elites. Legal scholar Richard Delgado explores this connection
between the descriptive and normative elements of narrative:

     “We decide what is, and, almost simultaneously, what ought to be.
     Narrative habits, patterns of seeing, shape what we see and that
     to which we aspire. These patterns of perception become habitual,
     tempting us to believe that the way things are is inevitable, or the best
     that can be in an imperfect world.”71

Solidarity by Design: Generating Counternarratives...  153

  Even if we recognize the status quo as harmful, our belief in its inevita-
bility leads us to conclude that “there are no other real possibilities that
would make things significantly better, and that thus there is little point
in struggling to change things.”72 We accept our existing power struc-
tures as the limit of what is and what ought to be. And once we accept
the dominant narrative about power, we are more likely to dismiss or
explain away contradictory experiences of ordinary people successfully
challenging elite rule.73 So developing faith in ordinary-people power
may not be as simple as experiencing it. We need counternarratives: sto-
ries that “destroy” our conventional understanding of power and “open
new windows into reality.”74

  Payne notes that many of the key participants in SNCC’s organising in
Greenwood, Mississippi came from families that told similarly defiant
stories about their place in the world. “The common thread [of these
familial narratives was] a refusal to see oneself as merely acted upon,
as merely victim. These are families in which children were encouraged
to believe that even within an oppressive social structure one retains
some control over one’s life.”75 By casting themselves as agency-hold-
ers in the face of intense subordination, these Black families occupied
counternarratives that challenged the absolute nature of white suprem-
acist power in the Deep South. And the folks who grew up with these
counternarratives went on to form “much of the core of the movement”
in Greenwood, upholding an organising tradition rooted deeply in the
agency and power of ordinary people.

  The counternarratives of these Mississippi families played out in the
reality they challenged: their tellers lived them daily in their acts of defi-
ance. But fictional counternarratives can shape our understanding of the
world as well. According to Lakoff, “some of the same neural structure
in the brain that is used when we live out a narrative is also used when
we see someone else living out that narrative, in real life or on TV, or if
we imagine it as when we are reading a novel.”76 Action and imagination

72 Wright (n 47) 286.
73 See Lakoff (n 5) 37 (“When you accept a particular narrative, you ignore or hide

     realities that contradict it.”).

are bound together in the very fabric of our brains. Just as our under-
standings of what is can limit our imagination of what could be, can’t our
imagination transform our understandings of what is? Fictional counter-
narratives “can be a catalyst for this: [they] can inspire imagination and a
feeling that, if not exactly anything, more is definitely possible.”77

  Counterstorytelling cannot serve as a replacement for the actual
experience of power fostered through participation in democratic or-
ganising efforts. But maybe it can set the stage for learning from such
experiences by priming participants to reframe their understandings of
power. Maybe it can encourage participation in the first place by pre-
senting a tangible, “juicy”78 vision of the kinds of liberatory victories only
ordinary-people power can win. And maybe it can promote solidarity
within the 99% by serving as a collaborative activity in which the teller
and listener “build a world richer than either could make alone.”79

4. Can We Unplay Elite Power?

  How might we use design to generate counternarratives that inspire
belief in ordinary-people power? One promising method is designing
critical play scenarios. Game scholar and designer Mary Flanagan de-
fines critical play as “creat[ing] or occupy[ing] play environments and
activities that represent one or more questions about aspects of human
life.”80 Critical play scenarios present a compelling avenue for immersing

77 Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, Speculative Everything (MIT Press 2013) 161.
     Ironically, despite their critiques of consumerism and their promotion of radical
     dreaming through design, Dunne and Raby seem resigned to a world in which the
     only disruptive power ordinary people hold is as consumers, not as workers: “Once
     workers could exert power by withholding their labor, by striking; today, as we see
     again and again, this is less so. In today’s economy it is as consumers that we have
     power. The most threatening act of protest for a capitalist system would be for its
     citizens to refuse to consume.” Dunne and Raby 37. Collective worker action can
     upend the labour-capital power structure by seizing control of the means of pro-
     duction. Can collective consumer action do the same?

78 See Pope (n 6) 3–4, quoting Demita Frazier in Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor (ed), How
     We Get Free: Black Feminism and the Combahee River Collective (Haymarket Books
     2017).

players in counterstories about power because they promote (un)learn-
ing, delineate subversive separation from the status quo, create non-
coercive safety spaces, and facilitate nonlinear narrative through player
agency.

4.1. Learning and Unlearning

Play is conducive to learning. Indeed, “[p]lay is an integral and vital part
of mental development and learning, and playful activities are essential
aspects of learning and creative acts.”81 The conditions under which we
strengthen our brain’s synaptic connections—allowing us to learn from
our experiences and tell ourselves new stories— “include repetition,
emotional arousal, novelty, and the careful focus of attention.”82 When
I first read that list, I immediately thought of video games. I’ve been an
avid player since I was a kid, dabbling in virtually every genre from classic
platformers to ambient interactive narratives. Every video game I’ve ever
enjoyed has used repetition as a tool to teach rules and skills, inspired
strong emotional reactions, introduced novelty through elements like
worldbuilding, art, music, and play mechanisms, and required focus to
overcome challenges. Unsurprisingly, research proves that games can be
a highly effective learning tool.83 Legal designers are already using video
games to teach people about legal processes and rights, like the NuLaw-
Lab’s RePresent games that simulate legal proceedings.84

81 ibid 4.
82 Siegel (n 59) 40.
83 See, e.g., Douglas B Clark, Emily E Tanner-Smith, and Stephen S Killingsworth, ‘Dig-

     ital Games, Design, and Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis’ (2016)
     86(1) Review of Educational Research 79 (finding that “digital games significantly
     enhanced student learning relative to nongame conditions.”); Sara de Freitas, ‘Are
     Games Effective Learning Tools? A Review of Educational Games’ (2018) 21(2) Jour-
     nal of Educational Technology and Society 74 (“To the question: are games effec-
     tive learning tools, the answer from the research is overwhelmingly positive.”).

     sent-games>.
156  Hallie Jay Pope

  With a critical approach, video games and other play scenarios might
help us not only to learn, but to unlearn, question, or “unplay” dominant
understandings of abstract concepts like power.

4.2. Subversion of the Status Quo

By definition, play takes place “outside ‘ordinary’ life” in what historian
Johan Huizinga dubbed “the magic circle.”85 While play is not inherently
critical of dominant narratives and modes of being,86 its distance from
the status quo lends itself to subversion.87

  Like any medium, games are embedded with ideologies “whether
game designers intend these ideologies or not.”88 Mainstream games
tend to reflect the context in which they are designed: “primarily white,
primarily male, and primarily proﬁt driven.”89 But if we approach these
default assumptions with critical reflection and intent, we can make the
magic circle a space for challenging dominant narratives rather than re-
inforcing them. Play is a natural outlet for revealing “‘hidden transcripts’
that often lie among the ‘ofﬁcial transcripts’ of power relations.”90

4.3. Safety Space

Delagdo points out that “counterstories, to be effective, must be or must
appear to be noncoercive.”91 Counternarratives challenge our deep and
often unexamined assumptions about the world. Their destructive pow-

86 See, e.g., Flanagan (n 80) 8 (noting that “the invention of organized doll play and
     ‘playing house’ during the U.S. industrial revolution [came about] when gender
     roles needed to be reasserted due to changing labor conditions”).

er can be frightening, triggering our instincts to protect ourselves instead
of engaging with an open mind. This makes games an ideal context for
generating and exploring counterstories. As Flanagan notes, “play oc-
curs only when players feel comfortable. Play is, by deﬁnition, a safety
space.”92 Play’s natural allergy to coercion and “overly didactic commu-
nication”93 makes games fertile ground for speculating about worlds and
ways of being that contradict our conventional understandings.94

4.4. Player Agency

In order to believe in ordinary-people power, we must believe in individu-
al efficacy: “What you do matters.”95 Play provides a space to experience
this directly in a safe, low-stakes context. Playing a counternarrative is
different from merely listening to or reading one in part because of the
player’s agency. While stories tend to be linear, unfolding the same way
each time they are told, games are non-linear: their outcomes will vary
based on the decisions the player makes.96 Rather than using design cov-
ertly to “nudge” people into changing their beliefs about power, play is
a chance to design opportunities to exercise agency, to present multi-
ple meaningful options.97 We can ask the player: What happens if you
place your faith in the power of ordinary people? What happens if you
don’t? By replaying or reposing the question in different branches of the
game’s narrative, players can explore multiple possible worlds with vary-
ing proximity from our dominant understanding of reality.

4.5. Ideas for Moving Forward

Flanagan concludes her examination of critical play with a call to action:

     “The challenge, then, is to ﬁnd ways to make interesting, complex play
     environments using the intricacies of critical thinking and to encoura-
     ge designers to offer many possibilities in games, for a wide range of
     players, with a wide range of interests and social roles. We can mani-
     fest a different future.”98

  In imagining the various ways we might inspire faith in ordinary-peo-
ple power through critical play, I find myself drawn to video games (un-
surprising, given how often I play them!). Video games are just one of
many categories of “constructed play scenarios,”99 but at this moment
in time, they are “especially prominent aspects of our playculture.”100
For the contemporary player, “digital technology has been inherently
bound with interactivity and diversion, and artists who engage in com-
puter-based creation and critique represent the majority of contempo-
rary examples of critical play.”101 With computers becoming increasingly
available to most Americans,102 video games can be made accessible to
a wide range of people. And digital technology can facilitate a high level
of narrative complexity, interactivity, and collaboration, making video
games a promising space for meaningful player agency and rich coun-
terstorytelling.

  What are some ways a video game could explore counternarratives
about ordinary-people power? One method might be to immerse the
player in the role of a ruling elite trying to preserve its kingly-priestly
status against challenges by ordinary people. The very fact that main-
taining power is a goal of play and not a given would serve to ques-
tion the dominant narrative of inevitable elite rule. For example, the
player could assume the role of a union-busting employer attempting

to exploit its workers as efficiently as possible and thwart collective ac-
tion—or perhaps less literally, a human being training ants to do her
bidding in her apartment. Confronted with the ants’ growing defiance
and unyielding solidarity, the player will have the option to resort to
increasingly depraved acts of suppression and violence in an effort to
quell their uprising. But the player’s task is impossible, an idealistic twist
on the “you-can’t-win” scenarios that activist games typically employ to
highlight the immensity of social problems:103 the ants always prevail,
whether by seizing control of the human’s apartment or by driving the
human to an existential crisis that renders “winning” undesirable.

  Alternatively, a game could play out more sincerely from the perspec-
tive of ordinary people building and exercising their power. To defy the
dominant narrative of the “exceptional” individual, the player could take
on the role of a collective. Perhaps the game could be played primar-
ily from the perspective of a “soup,” a melding of individual characters’
skills that grows more and more powerful as the game progresses and
defeats (or absorbs) a series of increasingly powerful opponents. The
game could be a riff on the parable of stone soup,104 with a mysterious
stone acting as the catalyst for the creation of the soup. Is the stone an
extraordinary power source the soup needs to succeed? Or is it simply
a shared experience that brings the ingredient-characters together to
collectively exercise their (delicious) pre-existing power?

  Whatever the concept, when it comes to critical play, methods mat-
ter. Flanagan proposes a framework for engaging in critical game design,
one that embeds values into the iterative design process and carves
out space for inclusivity: 1) Set design goals and value goals; 2) develop
rules and constraints that support values; 3) design for many different
play styles; 4) develop a playable prototype; 5) play test with diverse
audiences; 6) verify values and revise goals; and 7) repeat.105 I have just
barely begun the first stage of this process, reflecting on the values and

103 See Flanagan (n 80) 244.
104 Stone soup is a European folk story with many variations. The basic idea is this:

     a hungry visitor to a town convinces the townspeople that he possesses a magic
     stone, which produces soup when boiled in water. The curious townspeople end
     up contributing all kinds of ingredients, resulting in a tasty soup that everyone
     shares.

made these visual notes before I began working on this paper:

  It will be exciting to revisit these ideas after participating in this round-
table, armed with a fuller understanding of how designing critical play
scenarios might support liberatory endeavours. One helpful takeaway is
that I should engage in a broader study of historical and fictional narra-
tives about power. My research for this paper did not stretch beyond the
U.S. labour and civil rights movements in the early twentieth century.
Other contexts, places, moments, and voices will provide a richer per-
spective on the stories we live and tell about power—both those that
affirm elite rule and those that dare to assert the power of ordinary peo-
ple. It will also be useful to survey existing video games and analyse the
extent to which they entrench or challenge dominant power narratives,
in order to better understand the possibilities (and pitfalls) of employing
the medium for critical ends.
Solidarity by Design: Generating Counternarratives...  161

  McAlevey makes a compelling argument that meaningful and lasting
liberation can be won only when ordinary people organise collectively
to exercise their disruptive power. Both hers and Payne’s accounts of
radical movements in the twentieth century demonstrate that belief in
ordinary-people power is crucial to its successful exercise. Our conven-
tional narratives may tell us that the kingly-priestly-corporate class will
always reign supreme, but by engaging with counternarratives, we can
change the stories we tell ourselves about power. Critical play may prove
one fruitful method for examining the dominant narrative of elite rule
and generating faith in ordinary-people power. All that remains is to give
it a try.

5. Conclusion

McAlevey’s words inspired the title of this paper: “Solidarity among hu-
man beings can happen spontaneously, as in a flood or fire, or by design,
through organizing.”106 I am similarly drawn to Payne’s description of the
civil rights movement as “its own work of art,”107 a collective crafting of
liberatory power and joy. I doubt the authors meant to evoke the prac-
tices of art and design on any level other than metaphor, but I can’t resist
reading these phrases as an invitation.

  After all, we have good reason to blur the boundaries between artist,
designer, and activist. Flanagan remarks that “if we look to the funda-
mental reasons for why we play, the connection between artistic meth-
ods, activism, and game design becomes clear.”108 Those of us engaged
in these endeavours must devote “attention to possibility.”109 Acts of
creation—artistic or otherwise—are teeming with possibility: What will
come to be? What could be? Of all the beliefs that bear on our efforts
to challenge power structures, “perhaps the most important are beliefs
about what is possible.”110 We can take our cue from civil rights organ-
isers like Ella Baker, Myles Horton, and Septima Clark, who shared “an

expansive sense of the possibilities of democracy—an unrealistic sense
of the possibilities, their critics would say.”111 If we design, create, and
agitate with the goal of dismantling (and not merely reforming) elite
rule, our attention to possibility must stretch to include that which most
deem impossible.

HAVE (AND GIVE) A VOICE

Anne Ketola, Robert de Rooy and Helena Haapio

Abstract
Composite Comic Contracts are the next iteration of contract design, building on
the development of legally binding visual contracts, known as Comic Contracts.
Making contracts and contractual rights digitally accessible and understandable
affords agency and access to justice for the cognitively vulnerable. We describe the
creative and contracting processes and discuss the benefits and challenges from a
cognitive-linguistic perspective and from a Proactive Contracting legal and inter-
pretive perspective. By enhancing engagement, comprehension and retention of
information, Composite Comic Contracts provide the essential preconditions for
cognitive accessibility and the success of any contractual relationship with cogni-
tively vulnerable people. We argue that elusive legal certainty on potential legal
interpretive issues should not be a barrier to legal innovation and legal design.
Composite Comic Contracts are not only contracts that have a voice, but also ones
that give a voice.

1. Introduction

Comic Contracts are designed to be legally binding contracts where the
parties to the contract are represented as visual characters and where
the contract terms are communicated mainly visually.1 Comic contracts
present the terms of a contract through engaging visuals, an easy-to-fol-
low structure and simplified language. They are designed to make con-
tracts easy to engage with and easy to understand for low-literate and
vulnerable people.

  Composite Comic Contracts2 are the next iteration of contract design
towards affording vulnerable people3 the agency and the dignity to au-
tonomously understand contracts. This new contracting format digitally
combines the Comic Contract with an audio narrative of the contract,
mediated by synchronising the narrative with pre-set zooming and pan-
ning of the relevant images.

  Our chapter presents examples of a composite version of a Comic
Contract created for seasonal farmworkers on a ClemenGold citrus farm
in Letsitele, South Africa.4 The digital Comic Contract contracting plat-
form5 consists of two parts: the authoring tool and the contracting tool.
The audio-visual experience of the contract is compiled and crafted with
the authoring tool and the digital contract signing process is executed by
the contracting tool.6 In this chapter, the samples of the visual and audio
elements of the contract are presented in English. In practice, to further
aid easy comprehension, we envisage that both the textual and audio el-
ements of the Composite Comic Contract will be presented in the user’s
mother tongue.

2 This contract type can be associated with multisensory legal phenomena, a con-
     cept introduced by Colette Brunschwig. See e.g. Colette R Brunschwig, ‘Contract
     Comics and the Visualization, Audio-Visualization, and Multisensorization of Law’
     (2019) 46(2) The University of Western Australia Law Review 191. See also Colette

3 For the purposes of this chapter, ‘vulnerable people’ refers to people who need
     help to understand a contract, such as people not fluent in the contracting lan-
     guage or people who struggle to read and understand contracts or legal language.
     It typically includes ethnic minorities and migrants, and generally people who have
     poor reading skills.

4 The original Comic Contract created for ClemenGold is discussed, for instance, in
     Robert de Rooy, ‘Nurturing the Dignity of Vulnerable and Marginalized People, One
     Contract at a Time’ (2022) 84 The Clarity Journal 39.

5 The platform is called ShowSmart. Like the original Comic Contracts, it was devel-
     oped by Creative Contracts (Pty) Ltd, a social enterprise founded by chapter co-au-
     thor Robert de Rooy.

  Our chapter begins with viewing Composite Comic Contracts in the
context of access to justice, as a means to make contracts and contractual
rights accessible and understandable to vulnerable people. We describe
how Composite Comic Contracts are created and how the contracting
process works. We then discuss the benefits and challenges of Compos-
ite Comic Contracts from two disciplinary perspectives. We first evaluate
Composite Comic Contracts from a cognitive-linguistic perspective. We
discuss why images are superior to words when it comes to comprehen-
sion and recall of complex content, why having an audio narration of
the contract content reduces the reader’s cognitive load and why, from
a cognitive perspective, the Composite Comic Contract is a combination
of information presented in various modes.

  We then evaluate Composite Comic Contracts from a legal perspec-
tive. We introduce the Composite Comic Contract as an expression of
the principles of Proactive Contracting, where the focus is on success-
ful implementation rather than interpretation in dispute resolution. We
then discuss some preliminary legal and interpretive implications that
emerge from this new contracting format and offer some preliminary
views on these based on general principles of contract formation and
interpretation common to the jurisdictions with which the authors are
familiar. Our chapter does not attempt to draw any legal conclusions,
other than to map the territory and discuss some of the key factors that
influence the assessment of Composite Comic Contracts by different au-
diences, including legal audiences.

2. Access to Justice and Comic Contracts

The need to make contracts easy to understand forms part of the broad-
er challenge of providing people with access to justice, which is not just
about access to a court of law or to easier, quicker or cheaper dispute
resolution.7 Access to justice is also part of the UN’s Sustainable Devel-
opment Goal 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies
for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build

7 According to Richard Susskind, there are four elements of access to justice: dispute
     resolution, dispute containment, dispute avoidance and legal health promotion,

170  Anne Ketola, Robert de Rooy and Helena Haapio

effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.8 Access to
justice is a basic principle of the rule of law. In the absence of access to
justice ‘people are unable to have their voice heard, exercise their rights,
challenge discrimination, or hold decision-makers accountable’.9

  Contracts contain rights and impose obligations, and either party (in
theory) can call on the state to enforce these rights and obligations. So,
how fit for purpose is a contract when vulnerable people cannot read
what they sign, and, more importantly, are not able to access it when
they need to rely on the contract? Put differently: ‘You can’t fight for
your rights if you don’t know what they are.’10

  In addition to making contracts accessible and understandable for vul-
nerable people, the Composite Comic Contract seeks to address some
shortcomings of conventional paper contracts. First, paper contracts get
easily damaged and lost. There is a strong correlation between illiteracy
and poverty, and people living in poverty are vulnerable to imperma-
nence, displacement and weather. They often do not have the facilities
or access to facilities to safely store important documents. Second, paper
contracts require printing, completing, copying, and storing. Third, the
size of the population of people that are vulnerable and sign contracts
that they cannot read or understand requires a more efficient, scalable,
and easy-to-manage solution than paper-based contracts. Finally, what
about the needs of those vulnerable people who do not have good eye-
sight or who prefer to, or must, rely on their hearing?

  These learnings provoked a journey to develop a solution that con-
tinues to build towards the purpose of helping vulnerable people eas-
ily access their contractual rights and other important information, and
thereby access to justice. While it was obvious that the solution must be
a digital contracting platform, for the same reasons that public and pri-
vate organisations are embracing digital contract management systems,
designing and developing a solution for vulnerable users introduces con-

straints, for example: lack of access to computers or smartphones, high
turnover of phones and phone numbers, high data costs for users, and
the challenge of making it engaging and practical to view the pages of a
contract on a small screen.

3. Composite Comic Contracts

Most people are familiar with the forbidding format of conventional
contracts, which for many present a wall of text.11 Contracts are typi-
cally documents written by lawyers who assume that the only reader
of the contract will be another lawyer or a judge.12 When governments
and lawyers try to address the difficulties of low-literate people in read-
ing and understanding their contracts, the outcome of that effort often
looks something like this:

3.1. The Design of a Composite Comic Contract Template

While it is beyond the scope of this chapter to trace the history of the
legal design movement away from such a unidimensional assumption of
what a contract must look like, it is safe to say that the growing aware-
ness of Proactive Contracting, legal design and legal tech has removed
contracts (and contracting) from the exclusive custody of lawyers, and
opened up the design of contracts (the glue of business13 that holds
together our modern economies14) to professionals from various disci-
plines. People without a law degree are now invited to collaborate on
designing better contracts and contracting processes. It was in this trans-
disciplinary space that the Composite Comic Contract emerged from a
collaboration between a lawyer, a writer, illustrators, designers and soft-
ware developers.

  Composite Comic Contract templates are designed using the authoring
tool of the software platform15. We take the image files16 of the pages of
a Comic Contract, which are presented mainly in images, together with
any important or necessary text. We then write a script that describes
the content of the page, and we record a native speaker of the contract’s
language reading of the script. The image file and the audio file are then
uploaded to the authoring tool where zoom points and zoom depths are
set to synchronise the narrative with the relevant panels of the visual file
to guide the reader’s attention to the relevant images and information
as it is being discussed in the narrative. This process is facilitated by an
instant preview display of the template under construction, allowing the
author to fine tune the zoom points and narrative synchronicity for opti-
mal display and readability on any mobile device.

  The authoring tool allows for the system to add certain text informa-
tion to the digital contract as part of the preparation and execution of the
contract. Two types of additional text information are accommodated,

Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  173

offer information and acceptor information. Offer information markers
allow the party presenting the contract template (for example, a farmer
that wants to employ seasonal farm workers) to add information that
may vary from contract to contract to blank fields provided for on the
image file, based on the same template. This would typically include pay
rates, place of work, task lists or working hours. Acceptor information
markers provide for the system to add the details of each person who
executes the contract (in this case a farm worker) to the relevant blank
fields provided for on the relevant contract template. Once the Com-
posite Comic Contract template has been authored, it is published and
ready for presentation and execution.

3.2. The Presentation and Execution of a Composite Comic Contract

The platform can present the contract templates for execution in two
ways, depending on the employment scenario and the phone available
to the intended user: the remote (online) mode and the local (in-person)
mode.

  The ‘remote mode’ is suitable where the employer knows to whom
they want to send an employment contract and the prospective worker
has a smartphone, or easy access to someone with a smartphone or
a computer. Continuing with our farming scenario, this would normally
be the case with returning workers or workers who have pre-registered
for employment. In the remote mode, an SMS is sent with a link to a
personal website that contains a link to the contract. On clicking the link
the composite contract is displayed. After the contact has been viewed,
the worker is presented with the option to accept or reject the contract
offer. The remote mode allows the prospective employee to review and
consider the contract offer at their own leisure and in their own time.
When the worker has digitally signed the contract, the platform is up-
dated and the farmer is able to monitor which contract offers have been
signed, which are outstanding, and which have been refused.

  The ‘in-person’ mode is suitable where the employer is looking to
recruit large groups of new workers, or where the prospective workers
generally do not have smartphones, or easy access to someone with a
smartphone or a computer. The only requirement is that all the workers
need to bring a mobile phone that can receive and send an SMS. Mo-
174  Anne Ketola, Robert de Rooy and Helena Haapio

bile phones have become very cheap and are generally available to most
people. With the in-person mode each worker’s details are captured and
their phone number is authenticated before the contract template, com-
pleted with all the relevant offer information markers, is presented to all
the workers on a screen. At the end of the display of the full contract, the
workers are invited to digitally sign the contract by replying to an SMS
with the unique code displayed as part of the contract presentation, and
thus only available to the workers who are present for the presentation
and who have been registered.

  In both the remote and the in-person modes, once the contracts have
been signed, the system sends an SMS with a link to their phone, which
opens up their personal webpage, from where they can open a link to
their signed contract in two formats, a PDF format for downloading and
printing, and the audio-visual Composite Contract format, for easy ac-
cess to review the contract whenever needed.

  Technically, the integrity of the component parts of the contract is en-
sured and preserved through the generation of a digital key for each
signed contract, by hashing the metadata of all the files that make up
the audio-visual experience, including the time and date stamps of the
digital signature of the Composite Comic Contract. The system digitally
signs all the underlying data that make up the Composite Comic Contract
so that it can be independently verified that the underlying data has
not been changed since it was signed. To put it differently, the system
provides an immutable digital guarantee of the full content of the Com-
posite Comic Contract, when it was seen and heard, and when and by
whom it was signed.

  Finally, as the cost of data is still a very real barrier to digital inclusivity
of the most underserved members of society, the Composite Comic Con-
tract offers a low data solution, as the image and audio files are orders of
magnitude smaller than, for example, a typical movie file, which could,
in theory and to some extent, offer a similar experience to the user.

3.3. The Business Rationale for the Composite Comic Contract

Businesses routinely contract low-literate and vulnerable people, wheth-
er as suppliers of their labour, as consumers of products or services, or as
stakeholders in value chains or as communities affected by projects. In
Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  175

an ideal world, any legal product or process designed to make contracts
easier for low-literate and vulnerable people to engage with, and easier
to understand and remember the content, should suffice as a rationale
for the implementation of such solutions. But we don’t live in an ideal
world, and while there are happily some exceptions, most businesses
are ignorant of (or they have more pressing priorities than) the challeng-
es faced by low-literate and vulnerable people when they contract with
them. This means that if we want to reach more low-literate and vulner-
able people with empowering innovative legal products or processes,
these products and services must also have compelling value proposi-
tions for a business to implement such solutions.

  Applying this lens to Composite Comic Contracts, and staying with our
farming scenario, some of the value propositions that this solution offers
include: 1) the presentation and execution of the employment contract
are much easier and save a lot of time and resources that would other-
wise have to be allocated to each contracting session; 2) the contract
is always ‘explained’ and understood consistently, reducing the risk of
misunderstanding, Chinese Whispers17 and potential disputes; 3) the
employer has real time reporting of the contracts that were signed, and
proof that the contract was properly explained to the workers, which is
important, as farmers are often accountable to ethical or due diligence
audits by customers or buyers; and 4) the system is paperless, obviating
all the challenges of completing, data capture and storing of paper con-
tracts.

4. Composite Comic Contracts from a Cognitive Accessibility Perspective

The term cognitive accessibility refers to practices that remove barriers
for people who have difficulties in processing information.18 Readers
may be cognitively vulnerable for a variety of reasons: some have poor
or non-existing reading skills, some have cognitive challenges that affect

17 ‘Chinese whispers’ refers to a sequence of repetitions of a story, each one differing
     slightly from the original, so that the final telling bears only a scant resemblance to
     the original.

perception, memory, or attention, and some are non-fluent in a particu-
lar language. It is important to bear in mind that all of us can be cogni-
tively vulnerable when, for instance, we visit, or are forced to migrate to,
foreign countries and are not familiar with the local language.

  When designing information with the goal of removing cognitive ac-
cessibility barriers as effectively as possible, the design needs to be in
line with how the human mind processes information. A contract does
not fulfil its purpose unless the user is able to process, comprehend and
remember the information that is presented. The cognitive interpreta-
tion is therefore the ultimate threshold in access to justice.

  In this section of our chapter, we review research from different ar-
eas of psychology and cognitive linguistics to describe how the differ-
ent information modes of Composite Comic Contracts – images, written
text, auditive text, and movement through zooming and panning – are
cognitively processed, and how the Composite Comic Contract design
cognitively supports information processing. We first discuss comic illus-
trations on their own (What are the cognitive benefits of images?), then
presenting the illustrations with words (How can images support text
comprehension?), and finally, presenting the images and text with au-
dio and movement (What are the cognitive benefits of the audio-visual
presentation?). We conclude with an assessment of Composite Comic
Contracts as a whole (How do the components of the audio-visual prod-
uct support each other?).

4.1. Comic Illustrations from a Cognitive Perspective

Images are generally recognized with ease and remembered well. Stud-
ies in Experimental Psychology have repeatedly demonstrated that the
human brain can store a massive number of images with a significant
amount of detail.19 In an oft-quoted visual long-term memory experi-
ment, people were shown 10,000 images, and, in a subsequent recogni-
tion memory task, they remembered 83% of them.20 An extensive body

19 For a comprehensive review of such studies, see e.g. Talia Konkle and others,
     ‘Conceptual Distinctiveness Supports Detailed Visual Long-Term Memory for Re-
     al-World Objects’ (2010) 139(3) Journal of Experimental Psychology 558.

20 Lionel Standing, ‘Learning 10000 Pictures’ (1973) 25(2) Quarterly Journal of Exper-
Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  177

of literature over the past five decades has shown that images are re-
membered better than words: If a person is shown a series of images
and words and then tested for recall, the images are remembered bet-
ter.21 This mnemonic advantage of images over words is referred to as
the picture superiority effect.22

  Image interpretation is affected by reader characteristics and situa-
tional factors. For instance, eye-tracking research has demonstrated that
readers with different cultural backgrounds can look, and hence inter-
pret, images in differing ways. One such study compared how American
and Chinese participants looked at a set of images of various focal ob-
jects (people, objects) against complex backgrounds. The study found
that the American participants mainly looked at the focal objects in the
images and that the Chinese participants focused more on what could
be seen in the background. When subsequently interviewed about the
images, what the participants remembered about the images reflected
what they had visually focused on.23 In other words, the same images car-
ried different meanings for viewers with different cultural backgrounds.

  Furthermore, we also have individual differences as interpreters of
images within cultural communities. Psychological studies have demon-
strated that our expectations, attitudes and beliefs inﬂuence how we
interpret the materials we read, and that we interpret images – and texts
– differently in different emotional states.24 The interpretation we con-
struct of an image when we are frustrated is likely to be different to an
interpretation made whilst happy and calm. In addition to affecting our
interpretations of images, our feelings also physically affect our vision, in
other words, our feelings affect how our eyesight works at a particular

     imental Psychology 207.

     ognition: Evidence for the Physical-Distinctiveness Account’ (2019) 47 Memory &
     Cognition 182.

moment (for instance, when we feel fear, our contrast vision gets better:
we are able to distinguish contrast between different areas of an image
better than we would if we were comfortable and relaxed).25

  To sum up, images are a powerful information medium. They are en-
gaging and easily remembered, but their interpretation can be affected
by factors such as reader characteristics. Image interpretation can be
guided with anchoring the image’s meaning with words, either written
or spoken.

4.2. Word–Image Combinations from a Cognitive Perspective

Studies in cognitive science have theoretically modelled how the combi-
nation of words and images is cognitively processed. This research has
concluded that, as a general rule, people understand content better from
the combination of words and images than from words alone.26 These
studies propose that when examining a combination of words and im-
ages (e.g. reading a comic contract), the reader constructs connections
between the word and the images, resulting in conceptual processing
that is deeper than for verbal information alone, and the deeper pro-
cessing results in comprehending and remembering the content better.27
We may hence argue that, theoretically, images have the potential to
make words easier to digest. However, as discussed below, the benefits
of adding images to complex texts depend on various factors.

  Empirical cognitive studies on how adding images to a contract may
help or hinder readers in understanding the contract are yet to be con-
ducted. Yet, examining the effects of adding images to verbal content
has been the topic of a large body of research in the field of educational
psychology and pedagogy. These studies have analysed both individual
images used as support for understanding new words or concepts (e.g.
individual words matched with images) as well as comics that aim to

inform the reader about serious content, typically referred to as instruc-
tional comics.28

  The insights gained from these studies have a lot to offer for evaluat-
ing the benefits of comic contracts. In this line of research, learning re-
fers to being able to retrieve, from one’s long-term memory, information
one has previously been exposed to. For the non-expert party of an em-
ployment contract, the workers, the efficacy of the contract depends on
whether they have learned at least a part of it, in other words, whether
they can recall its content later on. They may not remember all of the
details of what was agreed, but as long as they remember the topics that
were included in the contract (e.g. ‘The contract mentioned something
about my sick leave.’), they can be prompted to recover and re-read the
contract.

  In the following sections, we review educational psychology and ped-
agogy research that has examined if and how images support the com-
prehension of complex verbal content and reflect on its implications for
comic contract design and use. Our focus is on two central arguments.
First, the benefits of adding images to complex text materials are differ-
ent for different types of content, and second, the benefits of adding
images are different for different types of readers.

4.2.1. Adding Images to Text is More Beneficial for Abstract Content than
Concrete Content
Within educational psychology, several studies have examined how
images can be used as support for learning new concepts and words.
Among these studies, one interesting line of research has compared the
effect images can have on the reader’s ability to learn concrete words
(such as table and thirsty) versus abstract words (such as regulation

28 In addition to instructional comics, this line of research has referred to these comics
     as data comics, educational comics or science comics when their subject matter is
     directly related to scientific content; see e.g. Ertugrul Ozdemir, ‘Comics in Modern
     Physics: Learning Blackbody Radiation Through Quasi-History of Physics’ (2017) 1(1)

and secure) in a foreign language they are still learning.29 The process of
learning new words in a foreign language can have parallels with reading
a contract: for a vulnerable employee with poor or non-existent reading
skills, an employment contract is likely to include words that are new to
them, even if the contract is presented in their native language.

  This line of research has shown that both types of words, concrete
ones as well as abstract ones, are remembered better if presented with
corresponding images. However, the improvement effect is small for
concrete words, and significant for abstract words.30 In other words, the
more abstract the content, the more readers benefit from image sup-
port. The image is remembered well, which strengthens the reader’s
ability to access the learned item (in other words, the word–image com-
bination that represents the abstract word) in their long-term memory.

  Traditional contracts are an archetype of abstract language, full of
concepts that a vulnerable reader may struggle to ground in their every-
day experience. Research on the development of comic contracts has
pointed out that illustrating abstract concepts in comic contracts can be
particularly challenging, and that such illustration solutions are often
‘visual examples’ of abstract ideas, such as an image of a judge’s gavel
as a symbol for a court order or law.31 Yet, these visual examples may
have the potential to significantly support readers’ comprehension of
abstract content. Even if we can’t literally draw concepts such as law, we
can offer a visual hint of what the concept refers to, and hence ground
its meaning.

  For example, the Composite Comic Contract examined in this chapter
explains that the worker will have to pick a minimum number of bags of
clementines per day; if they fail to do so, they may receive a warning. A

warning is a somewhat abstract concept and is therefore challenging to
illustrate precisely. The illustration used in the contract (Figure 2) de-
picts a visual example of what receiving a warning might look like: it is
a serious conversation between a worker and a representative of the
employer. The image explains the meaning of the word and the word
anchors the meaning of the image.

  The word ‘warning’ is superimposed at the bottom right of the image.
This corresponds to one of the cognitively-grounded design principles
created within Educational Psychology: the so-called spatial continuity
principle states that multimodal messages containing words and images
are better understood if the words and images are presented near to,
rather than far from, each other on a page or a screen32 (more of these
principles are discussed in section 4.3).

  Images also assist in the assimilation of difficult content by making
the content more engaging. Comprehending complex content requires
active cognitive engagement, and the visual appearance of the material

182  Anne Ketola, Robert de Rooy and Helena Haapio

is one of the motivational factors that can either increase or decrease
this engagement.33 Images increase the reader’s motivation to engage
with the materials – this is, in fact, the premise and starting point for the
audio-visual media research reviewed in section 4.3. Research has even
been conducted on whether adding purely decorative, topic-irrelevant
images to texts increases readers’ engagement, the outcome being that
they do, in fact, make the reader read the material in more detail, but,
unsurprisingly, do not contribute to text comprehension when meas-
ured in comprehension post-tests.34

4.2.2. Adding Images to Text Benefits Different Readers in Different Ways
Research on instructional comics has compared how factors in the read-
ers’ cognitive backgrounds, such as language level or academic abilities,
may affect how beneficial image support is. These studies have involved
a presentation of complex subject matter either as text-only or as an
instructional comic for large groups of readers.

  These studies have concluded that the more cognitively vulnerable a
reader is, the more their reading comprehension benefits from reading
complex content in a comic-format as opposed to text-only. Interestingly,
the opposite applies for readers who are not cognitively vulnerable: the
comic format can actually hinder their reading comprehension. Examples
of these studies include comparing the reading comprehension of nano-
technology-related science text by low- and high-achieving students (i.e.
students who have learning difficulties and students who do not)35 and
comparing the reading comprehension of English learning material by
readers of low and high proficiency in the English language.36

  These studies offer similar explanations as to why a skilled reader
does not necessarily benefit from the comic-style format: a reader who

does not need extra support in comprehending a complex text is likely
to have experience in reading similar complex texts. The comic, in turn,
is a very different type of information offering; it differs from how that
reader is accustomed to constructing meaning, and it can hence actually
make reading more difficult. The value of these findings for comic con-
tract development may lie in acknowledging these reader differences
and their possible connection with attitudes towards comic contract use:
A high-proficiency reader who is experienced in reading traditional con-
tracts may not always see the value of comic contracts, since for them
personally, the traditional text-only format can be easier to cognitively
process. The intended users of comic contracts, namely low- or illiterate
readers, however, can significantly benefit from the comic-format – the
more cognitively vulnerable they are, the more the comic helps.

4.3. Audio-Visual Contracts Format From a Cognitive Perspective

A Composite Comic Contract includes images, movement that guides
the reader through the image page, an audio narrative, and a few writ-
ten keywords and key phrases. In this section of the chapter, we review
research on how humans process audio-visual instructive media (i.e.
combinations of still images, moving images, written words, spoken
words and sound). We discuss how the combination of these elements is
cognitively processed and how audio-visual products such as Composite
Comic Contracts should best be designed based on these insights.

4.3.1. Composite Comic Contracts and Information Selection
In the sections above, we concluded that, as a general rule, combining
words and images has benefits for information processes: the combina-
tion leads to cognitive processing that is deeper than for reading words
alone. Words can be presented either as written or spoken information,
i.e. either as visual information (perceived with eyes) or auditive infor-
mation (perceived with ears). This presentation modality affects how the
words are cognitively processed.

  Presenting words as auditive information has obvious benefits for
someone who has poor or non-existing reading skills, but it also ben-
efits more skilled readers by reducing their cognitive load. In terms of
cognitive load theory, adding auditive information reduces the so-called
184  Anne Ketola, Robert de Rooy and Helena Haapio

split-attention effect.37 Split-attention occurs when readers have to split
their attention between separate sources of information, such as images
and written words in a comic contract. The reader looks at the words,
then images, then words again. This switching of visual focus creates ex-
traneous cognitive load: it requires information to be maintained in the
working memory while searching for the next information source, which
diverts working memory resources away from doing what they are sup-
posed to be doing, namely forming a schema, or an understanding, of
the material. If the words are presented as audio narration, the reader
does not have to split their attention.

  Research in Educational Psychology has similarly argued that present-
ing identic verbal information as written words and as audio narration is
counterproductive in audio-visual instructive media since readers have
limited capacity to process visually presented material. This so-called
capacity limitation hypothesis has been formulated into an audio-visual
design technique known as the redundancy principle, which states that
an audio-visual design with audio narration should only include the most
essential words (headings, keywords, key phrases) as written text; the
rest is redundant. Repeating the most essential words in writing guides
readers’ attention by emphasising this content.38

  The example presented above in Section 4.2, regarding the minimum
number of bags of clementines the worker has to pick per day, demon-
strates this technique (see Figure 2). The audio narration in this part of
the Composite Comic Contract states: (‘For example, if you pick only 39
bags in a day,) you will receive a warning, your first warning’ (see Process
screenshots in Appendix 1). The only word displayed as written text in
the Composite Comic Contract is ‘Warning’. For those users who are able
to read, this visual repetition supports following the contract narrative
by offering a reference point. A part of the target readership is illiterate
and not able to access written text at all, so from their perspective, all of
the written text is redundant. From their perspective, keeping the writ-
ten text to a minimum also serves to keep the design as clear as possible.

4.3.2. Composite Comic Contracts and Information Interpretation
Cognitively-grounded design principles for audio-visual instructive me-
dia emphasise that when presenting images with audio narration, the
images and corresponding narration should be presented simultaneous-
ly rather than successively (so-called temporal contiguity principle).39
Composite Comic Contracts implement this principle by zooming and
panning the image page: the relevant zoom points predetermine where
the reader will look when hearing a particular part of the contract.

  This temporal integration of words and images is particularly impor-
tant for page designs with several distinct elements such as comic pan-
els, because we cannot predict the order in which a reader will scan a
page. Designers may assume that the scan path starts from the top left
and proceeds according to the typical Western reading direction, but
eye-tracking research has demonstrated that the reader often first looks
at visually salient items in a page design, such as items that are rela-
tively large or bright-coloured.40 The zooming and panning of the comic
contract page is needed to make sure that the reader’s visual focus cor-
responds to the part of the contract page that is being discussed in the
audio narration.

  The zooming and panning in the Composite Comic Contract are more
than mere camera movement: they segment the visual information for
the reader and transform the image from something static to an infor-
mation offering that evolves and progresses in time. For instance, with
the clementine bag picking example discussed above, the panning takes
the reader from the left panel (a man with a bag of clementines) to the
panel on the right (receiving a warning), as the narration states: ‘For ex-
ample, if you pick only 39 bags in a day, you will receive a warning, your
first warning’ (see Figure 3). The vertical movement from one panel to
the next happens within the duration of narrating this sentence, which
emphasises cause and effect and the outcome of events.

  As the image merges with the movement of zooming and panning, it
essentially becomes a different information offer than the image alone.
The meanings carried by the other modes of the Composite Comic Con-
tract also merge. The meanings presented through words and images
become intrinsically intertwined: the images explain the words and the
words anchor the meanings of the images. The keywords that are dis-
played as written text place a special emphasis on these words as they
are uttered in the audio narrative. Hence, from a cognitive perspective,
the content of the Composite Comic Contract cannot be reduced down
to any of its constituent elements alone: the contract genuinely is a com-
bination of information presented in various modes.

5. Composite Comic Contracts as an Expression of Proactive Contracting

In recent years, researchers and practitioners have started to discover
and develop new ways of making and representing contracts, with the
focus shifting from winning a legal argument to making it easier for the
parties to achieve their business goals and show respect for their coun-
Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  187

terparties.41 New contract genres and designs have been introduced,
and contract tech has opened up access to new tools, templates and pat-
terns that challenge old beliefs, and even industries.42 Since the 2010s,
visual contracts – contracts with embedded images or infographics to
supplement text – and Proactive Contract Design have started to gain
recognition in business and academia.43 The pioneers of contract vis-
ualisation proposed a visual turn in contract communication: the use of
visual representation as a way to enhance contract clarity and ease of
use, embedding images such as timelines, flowcharts and icons in actual
contracts, contract briefs and guidance, and as planning and thinking
tools during negotiations.44

  Composite Comic Contracts are an expression of the principles of Pro-
active Contracting, a form of contracting that is deliberately designed
to achieve contracting success. The approach builds on proactive legal
thinking, where the focus is on preventing unnecessary problems from
arising and promoting positive outcomes, such as legal empowerment,

optimal functioning and enhanced access to justice.45 Proactive legal
strategies have been used in many contexts, varying from achieving the
business goals of contract parties to promoting societal goals and help-
ing businesses become more sustainable.46

  To this end, Proactive Contracting promotes the use of visualisation in
contracts to achieve the intended success of the transaction or relation-
ship.47 Visualisation of legal or legally relevant information is not limited
to the domain of contracts, of course, as proven in the work on Visual
Law.48 Apart from lawyers and legal scholars, the Proactive Contracting
and Proactive Law movement also includes designers and scholars of
design, who, through the theories and practice of information design,
have actualized and systematised the use of visualisation in contracts.49
Within this movement, the use of visualisation in the context of con-
tracts has developed to include: 1) visualisation in contracts, 2) visualis-
ation about contracts, 3) visualisation for contracts and 4) visualisation
as contracts.50

  It was these pioneering ideas that inspired the development of the
first Comic Contracts, and their ideas and rationale continue to inspire
the exploration and design of solutions to achieve contracting success.
We argue that the Composite Comic Contracts extend the use of visual-
isation and harness the other tools of communication, including audio,
movement and digital technology to achieve contracting success.

6. Composite Comic Contracts from a Legal Perspective

6.1. Are Composite Comic Contracts Legally Binding?

When presenting the idea of Comic Contracts, we are often asked: ‘Are
they legally binding?’. While there is no case law on the question, there
have been a few remarks and articles on the subject.51 The former High
Court Chief Justice Robert French, speaking at the ‘Comic and Creative
Contracts Conference’ hosted by the University of Western Australia in
2017, stated that there was ‘no reason in principle why pictorial con-
tracts explained orally or supplemented textually or contextually could
not be enforceable in the same way as any other contract’. Mark Gi-
ancaspro concludes: ‘There is ample authority supporting the notion
that a comic contract can satisfy the legal test of contractual certainty’52.

  We anticipate the same question in respect of Composite Comic Con-
tracts. First, we can state that Composite Comic Contracts are designed
to be legally binding and enforceable. They are designed to be an accu-
rate memorandum of the terms of the contract, and for the authenticity
of the contract and the electronic signature of the contract to be non-re-
pudiable. Second, from a legal point of view, while Composite Comic
Contracts may sound unusual at first, there is no law prohibiting such
contracts. The principle of freedom of contract is a universal and essen-

tial starting point for contract law. It allows the parties to choose the
content and form of their contracts, and the components they consider
appropriate for their purposes. Both civil law and common law coun-
tries have rules that require certain contracts or contract content to be
in writing to be enforceable. But ‘in writing’ does not necessarily mean
just words, nor does it exclude the addition of something to words. Im-
ages or spoken words can reflect the intentions of the parties in addition
to any required written text. Freedom of contract is not unlimited, of
course, and there are other intervening factors. These, however, are be-
yond the scope of this chapter.

  We recognize that we are, to some extent, entering uncharted le-
gal territory, as there are no precedents in terms of rules of interpre-
tation that have been applied to this new contracting format. So, for
the purposes of our work, it is important to examine the first principles
of contracting based on the requirements and expectations of differ-
ent contract audiences and how these can be better aligned during the
contract design stage, to guide the easy and consistent interpretation of
Composite Comic Contracts by all stakeholders: the intended audience
of low-literate and vulnerable people, the business users and finally legal
users. The goal is to ensure easy comprehension and predictability and
to prevent unnecessary disputes. Our work is ongoing, and in this section
we present some preliminary legal and interpretive implications for legal
users that emerge from this new contracting format. In the following,
we also cite some case law as illustrative, not authoritative, examples of
jurisprudence in which aspects of the issues raised by this innovation in
contracting have been discussed.

6.2. Contracts Come in Many Shapes and Forms

For centuries, the legal enforcement and interpretation of contracts has
been about verbal and written contracts. As a result, there is a rich and
deep body of contract law literature and case law about the interpreta-
tion of such contracts. No treatises currently cover the legal interpre-
tation of Composite Comic Contracts, and few, if any, statutes, cases or
other resources address the interpretation of contracts’ visual and oth-
er non-textual expressions. While different jurisdictions have different
requirements for contracts to be valid and enforceable in court, with
Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  191

very few exceptions (such as wills and surety agreements), contracts do
not need to be in writing to constitute valid and binding legal agree-
ments. Where there are such legal requirements, the minimum content
to comply with such prescribed exceptions can be easily included within
a Composite Comic Contract without undermining their purpose of be-
ing autonomously accessible to low-literate and vulnerable contracting
parties.

  Unless specifically regulated – or, if regulated, provided that the reg-
ulatory requirements are met – the parties are free to choose the form
of their contract, which can be verbal or written, and made on paper
or electronically. There should then be no reason why a combination of
contracting modes cannot constitute a valid, binding and enforceable
legal agreement.

6.3. Which Part of the Composite Comic Contract is ‘Legally Binding’?

Conventional drafters of contracts are accustomed to seeking to transfer
the risk of contradictions between the text and its explanation to their
counterparty, by including statements to the effect that only the writing
is legally binding and that any explanations – and even headings – are
provided ‘for convenience only’, or by including text to neutralise rules
of interpretation that allow for any ambiguity to be interpreted against
the party responsible for drafting the contract. If we were to add to the
record of text the record of images, the record of audio narrative, and
the record of the digitally predetermined and synchronised zooming and
panning mediating these modes of communication, the urge to identify
one of the modes as the only legally binding one would easily arise.

  Comic Contracts have shown us that visualisation as contracts is possi-
ble. It extends the idea of what a contract could be and could look like, in
other words, that a contract does not need to be a document filled with
text. The Composite Comic Contract similarly challenges the assumption
of what can constitute a contract. We have shown that from a cognitive
assessment perspective, the Composite Comic Contract cannot be re-
duced to any of its constituent elements alone: the contract genuinely is
a combination of information presented in various modes.

  From a legal design perspective, the Composite Comic Contract priv-
ileges the user’s experience and interests. From the user’s perspective,
192  Anne Ketola, Robert de Rooy and Helena Haapio

especially from the perspective of a low-literate or vulnerable person,
any attempt to try and introduce a condition that makes one mode le-
gally binding over another would be artificial and introduce unneces-
sary complexity. If we cannot predict which of the modes, visual, text or
audio, the user understands most easily, in which of the modes do we
communicate the fact that one of the modes would be the only legally
binding mode?

  Finally, from a legal perspective, why is it necessary to ‘unscramble the
egg’ and insist that one mode is more binding than another? In the typical
scenarios faced by conventional contract drafters described above, there
is normally a text record of an agreement and evidence of a spontaneous
or contemporaneous verbal explanation of the agreement. Then it may be
prudent to ensure that the weight of the ‘more reliable’ evidence of the
text must prevail over the possibility of ‘less reliable’ evidence of a verbal
explanation. Even if the verbal explanation was recorded, the explanation
itself could be spontaneous, dynamic, and less coherent. However, where
the modes are prepared and recorded equally and simultaneously as part
of a single artefact of the proposed agreement, there is no evidentiary
reason for any one mode to prevail over another.

  We argue that for these reasons, the Composite Comic Contract can-
not and should not be reduced to only the visual Comic Contract, or only
the narrative, ignoring the combination of these formats as mediated
by the digitally predetermined and synchronised zooming and panning.
We argue that what constitutes the legally binding contract is the user’s
whole experience of the presentation of the contract made up of all its
constituent parts.

6.4. How Would Lawyers Interpret a Composite Comic Contract?

With the increased attention to human-friendly contracts such as visual
and layered contracts,53 the possible legal challenges related to their in-

53 See e.g. Waller, ‘Designing Contracts for Human Readers’ (n 49); Rob Waller, Ste-
     fania Passera and Helena Haapio, ‘Layered Contracts: Both Legally Functional and
     Human-friendly’ in Kai Jacob, Dierk Schindler, Roger Strathausen and Bernhard
     Waltl (eds), Liquid Legal – Humanization and the Law (Springer 2022).
Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  193

terpretation and enforcement have started to gain scholarly attention.54
As regards case law, at the time of writing, we are not aware of any case
law directly related to the topic of this chapter.

  Two English High Court rulings, Altera Voyageur Production Limited v
Premier Oil E&P UK Ltd [2020] EWHC 1891 (Comm) and Starbev GP Ltd
v Interbrew Central European Holdings BV [2014] EWHC 1311 (Comm),
have dealt with ‘illustrations’ and ‘worked examples’, recognizing that
these can be integral parts of a commercial contract and may be where
the parties’ true bargain can be found. In these two cases, the ‘illus-
trations’ and ‘worked examples’ were expressed in words rather than
images. In the Altera Voyageur case, the Judge approved of comments
in Starbev GP Ltd v Interbrew Central European Holdings BV [2014]
EWHC 1311 (Comm) [284] that ‘[t]here is (...) no reason why illustrations
or examples should be construed differently than any other term in a
contract’ and that ‘in the context of lengthy contracts in financial trans-
actions with much boiler plate (...) illustrations or examples deserve par-
ticular attention as something to which the parties particularly turned
their minds’.

  Even though these cases dealt with verbal rather than visual illustra-
tions and examples, the analogy is striking: we argue that there is no
reason why visual or voice components of a contract – as long as the
parties have made them part of their contract – should be construed or
interpreted differently than any other part of a contract. After all, the
key goal of the interpretation exercise is to determine what the parties
intended should happen.

  While Composite Comic Contracts are a novel concept, the legal chal-
lenges related to them are not entirely new. Business people and law-
yers experienced in contract practice frequently encounter contracts
that are partly oral and partly written as well as contracts that are made

in many languages. When a contract is written in different languages (in-
cluding also picture language and multimodality), a number of potential
issues can arise due to the challenges of accurate intra- or inter-semiotic
translation, which can be hard, especially due to the different concepts,
styles and language used in different contexts and legal systems. Courts
and arbitrators have dealt with such problems, to which the parties may
or may not have provided guidance for example through a prevailing
language provision55 or an integration clause.56

  As indicated above, it is possible for images to sometimes be subject
to differing interpretations. Should an image or a combination of images
alone or with text be relevant to a legal dispute, the contract would have
to be interpreted and a decision would have to be taken on which inter-
pretation prevails. But does this possibility disqualify the use of visuals
in contracting? We argue that it does not, just as the fact that there are
legal libraries filled with case law about differing interpretations of text-
based agreements does not disqualify the use of text in contracting.

  The first point to make is that unlike conventional text-based agree-
ments, it is much more likely that the transparent and easy to under-
stand content of a Composite Comic Contract will surface any ambiguity
or contradictions before a contract is signed. But we nevertheless need
to consider the question of how the courts may deal with differing inter-
pretations of a Composite Comic Contract.

  The rules of contract interpretation have developed mainly in the con-
text of text-based agreements. Currently, there is no established legal
doctrine for interpreting the combination of written text, images and au-
dio in contracts. However, the idea of visuals as contract components is
not entirely new for judges and arbitrators. For certain types of conven-
tional contracts, such as construction and engineering contracts, visuals
have been used for quite some time: maps and explanatory drawings

55 A prevailing language provision typically states that in the event of a dispute about
     interpreting the contract arising from the fact that it exists in multiple languages,
     the contract in a named, ‘official’ language will govern the interpretation.

56 Some (but not all) countries’ laws require a court to focus on the written con-
     tract alone, and the parties can include in their contract a provision, an integration
     clause (aka a merger clause or an entire agreement clause) to the same effect.
     See, e.g. Annola, Haapio and Koskela (n 54) and Kim Lewison, The Interpretation of
     Contracts (Sweet & Maxwell 2007) 99.
Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  195

have traditionally been relied on to provide technical clarity, for example,
by showing location, boundaries, shape and size, tolerances, or other as-
pects of the desired outcome of the performance.57 Courts and arbitral
tribunals have dealt with disputes involving such visuals and have inter-
preted contracts in relation to them. Again, the parties (or the contract
forms they use) may or may not have provided guidance in this respect.58

  There is the view that not knowing how courts or litigators would view
– or challenge – Composite Comic Contracts could create a barrier to
their adoption and slow down the development of the field. In the con-
text of visuals, according to Jay Mitchell, ‘[w]idespread use of visuals by
lawyers is unlikely (and unwise) absent the demonstration of a solid legal
foundation for such use.’59

  But as our courts generally do not engage in determining matters of
academic interest only, how do we develop this ‘solid legal foundation’?
The enormous legal foundation built up over centuries of jurisprudence
on the interpretation of text agreement has done little to reduce disputes
regarding contract interpretation. A decision by a court on any contract,
image or text interpretation would only be valid for that image or text
in the context of that contract. Conversely, a decision on any defect or
issue in a visual or textual agreement would not disqualify or invalidate
all visual or textual agreements.

  As contracts are made for people to use, and not for lawyers to lit-
igate, we believe that the absence of a solid legal foundation for the
use and possible interpretative issues posed by Composite Comic Con-
tracts should not dissuade contract designers from adopting innovative

57 Annola, Haapio and Koskela (n 54).
58 The NEC contract flowcharts, for example, expressly state that the flow charts are

     not contract documents, they are not part of the contract, and they should not be
     used for legal interpretation of the meaning of the contract. See, e.g., NEC, Guid-
     ance Notes and Flowcharts for the Professional Services Contract – NEC3 (Thomas
     Telford 2005) 1. – For the purposes, and in the context, of our work, such a solution
     would be counter-productive and we do not recommend it for Composite Comic
     Contracts.
59 Mitchell (n 54) 852. For a more general discussion of the potential dangers of
     visualisation in the legal domain, see Elizabeth Porter, ‘Taking Images Seriously’
     (2014) 114 Columbia Law Review 1687, 1752–53. Porter mentions the lack of legal
     rules or traditions to mitigate the interpretive risks associated with images among
     ‘three primary dangers of welcoming images into the legal-writing toolbox’.

formats to empower people to easily understand their contracts. We
are not aware of writers cautioning the developers and users of smart
contracts to wait until there is a solid body of jurisprudence of smart
contracts.

7. Conclusion

Composite Comic Contracts are an expression of the principles of Pro-
active Contracting, a form of contracting that aims to achieve contract-
ing success in the best possible way. In the design of the content, we
privilege the content that expresses the parties’ mutual expectations.
The design of the format, in turn, aims to achieve cognitive success in
the best possible way. We employ the formats that are best at engag-
ing the users’ attention and that remove cognitive accessibility barriers:
visual information and audio information. We also make the effort of
presenting the information in the user’s mother tongue. All these facets
contribute to enhancing engagement with, and the comprehension and
retention of the information, essential preconditions for the success of
any contractual relationship.

  In this chapter, we have argued that what constitutes the Composite
Comic Contract is the whole, and not any of its constituent parts. From
the point-of-view of cognitive processing, Composite Comic Contracts
are complex combinations of images, movement that guides the reader
through the images, written text and audio narration. Each of these ele-
ments is a separate information offer, but when presented together they
become a single source of information. In other words, the contract is
not only the visual comic contract or the narrative, it is the combination
of these formats as mediated by the digitally predetermined and syn-
chronised zooming and panning.

  Composite Comic Contracts take advantage of the full capacity that
humans have for information processing. The images make difficult con-
tent easier to engage with, and they assist in explaining and structuring
the information. Verbal information is easier to absorb when we hear it
as opposed to when we read it, since our visual focus does not have to
keep switching between the words and the images on the page.

  The Composite Comic Contract challenges the assumption of what can
constitute a contract and raises new questions, including whether it can
Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give) a Voice  197

constitute a binding agreement and whether one mode should or could
prevail over others. In this chapter we have offered some preliminary
views on some of the interpretive issues that may arise. We argue for
an approach to innovative contracting formats that privileges the inter-
ests of users. Waiting for elusive legal certainty on potential legal issues
should not be a barrier to legal innovation and legal design. Composite
Comic Contracts afford agency and access to justice for the cognitively
vulnerable. Therefore, they are not only contracts that have a voice, but
also ones that give a voice.

                                          This new contracting format combines our visual
                                         comic contract with an audio narrative of the con-

                                           tract, mediated by zooming and panning to the
                                         relevant panels in sync with the narrative. We call
                                        this new contracting format Composite Comic Con-

                                                                    tracts.

     While our system also supports a process where the
     users don’t have smartphones, here we present the
     typical contracting process which assumes the user

                         has a smartphone.

       The contracting process starts when the user re-
     ceives an SMS with a link to view a presentation of

                         their contract offer.

     When the new employee clicks on the link, it takes
     them to their own personal website where they can

                see an outstanding contract offer.

       When they click on the PLAY button, their digital
                   comic contract is presented.

 For purposes of this annexure, we only show one
 sample page of how the user will experience the

               composite contract offer.

The textual and audio elements of the Composite

       tongue to further aid comprehension.

                                           You need to pick a minimum of 46 bags of
                                                        clementines per day.

                                       You may take a break every now and then, but if
                                        you end up picking less than 46 bags, you may

                                                         receive a warning.

                                      For example, if you pick only 39 bags in a day, you
                                           will receive a warning, your first warning.

                                       If you later again fail to pick the required 46 bags
                                     of clementines per day, for example, if you only pick
                                     25 bags instead of 46 bags, you will again receive a

                                                  warning, your second warning.

                                       If you later then again fail to pick the required 46
                                     bags of clementines, your employment contract will
                                     be terminated and you will have to leave the farm.’

But the display of a whole page on a phone is too cluttered and small, so we have
also developed the zooming and panning function, so that the contract is easy to

                                  follow on a small screen.

      At the end of the presentation of the Composite
     Comic Contract, the users will be invited to accept
     the contract by clicking ‘I Agree’, or they may de-

                 cline the offer of the contract.

     After accepting the contract, the users’ signed con-
     tract will be displayed under the ‘accepted’ screen.
      When users click on the PLAY CONTRACT button,

       they can review the audio visual version of the
     contract to check their rights, obligations and pro-
     cedures as many times as they like whenever they

                                 like.

      When users click on the VIEW CONTRACT button,
     they can view, download and print the PDF version

6. POSSIBILITY-DRIVEN DESIGN AND
RESPONSIBLE USE OF AI FOR SUSTAINABILITY

Marika Salo-Lahti and Helena Haapio

Abstract
Much of the legal scholarship has focused on past or present problems and issues
rather than future possibilities. Practitioners involved in legal drafting have focused
primarily on conflicts and legal enforcement, rather than on goals and successful
implementation. For scholars and practitioners with a proactive legal and design
mindset, goals and possibilities drive the work. In addition to mindset and think-
ing, doing – implementation – is critical. In this paper, we merge proactive legal
thinking with possibility-driven design and move from thinking to doing, using tem-
plates, design patterns and AI tools. Our examples illustrate how the responsible
use of AI tools can help navigate the new legal landscape of sustainability, and how
possibility-driven legal design can be used as a framework for balancing the needs
and expectations of people, businesses and society at large. By working in this way,
we argue, it is possible to achieve better investment decisions and more sustain-
able and responsible contracting – ultimately better business and a better society.

1. Proactive Legal Thinking and Doing for Legal Design

1.1. Combining Possibility-Driven Design with a Proactive Approach to Law

Design affects all aspects of our society: homes, workplaces, transporta-
tion and communication. The challenging years of the pandemic forced
a new approach to their design. All designed products, services, environ-
ments and systems can influence our wellness and health to a greater or
lesser extent.1 Positive design refers to the forms of design that consider
the impact of design on the well-being of individuals and societies.2

206  Marika Salo-Lahti and Helena Haapio

  For a long-time, however, neither doctors nor lawyers focused on
well-being. Instead, they mostly provided ex post services: curing the
sick and solving legal problems.3 With a new mindset and legal design,
law can be used ex ante, proactively, to promote what is desirable and
prevent what is not. A proactive, possibility-driven approach to law
makes it possible to design the legal well-being of people and organisa-
tions, rather than focusing on curing their illnesses, such as disputes and
litigation. By integrating legal considerations into the design process, it
is possible to create solutions that are legally sound, user-friendly, and
effective: an excellent example of the promotive dimension of proactive
law4. In this paper, we merge our proactive law perspective with a pos-
itive, possibility-driven design approach. These approaches, we argue,
can enrich the understanding and use of legal design.

  While the traditional design approach is typically used in situations
where a specific problem or set of problems has been identified, the
possibility-driven design process can be initiated and guided by the
exploration of possibilities even when there are no problems in sight.
Rather than focusing on identifying, analysing and addressing problems
or challenges, possibility-driven design envisions what could be, rather
than what is. To continue the health analogy, even healthy people can
feel better, and it is important to take care of oneself even when one is
not sick. While the problem-driven approach focuses on removing and
resolving existing problems and preventing future ones, the possibili-

     well-being of individuals and communities’. Positive design is noted to create pos-
     sibilities: it ‘envisions and realizes optimistic futures. Rather than merely reducing
     people’s problems, it offers them opportunities to improve their well-being’.
3 It should be noted that in medicine, since the development of genetic studies,
     there has been a greater emphasis on personalised care and health management.
     In these respects, legal design could do for law what personalised medicine has
     done for medicine. For the latter, see, e.g., Laura H Goetz and Nicholas J Schork,
     ‘Personalized Medicine: Motivation, Challenges, and Progress’ (2018) 109(6) Fertil-
     ity and Sterility 952.
4 The proactive law approach differentiates two aspects of proactivity, one being
     the promotive dimension (promoting what is desirable; encouraging good behav-
     iour) and the other being the preventive dimension (preventing what is not de-
     sirable, keeping legal risks from materialising). See, e.g., Opinion of the European
     Economic and Social Committee on ‘The proactive law approach: a further step
     towards better regulation at EU level’ [2009] Official Journal of the European Union
     C175/26, para 5.3.
Possibility-Driven Design and Responsible Use of AI for Sustainability 207

ty-driven design goes beyond this, seeking to design artefacts that ulti-
mately improve people’s lives.5

   Both approaches are important and necessary dimensions of legal de-
sign. They are not mutually exclusive and can often be used in combina-
tion or in sequence during the design process. We argue for a greater
focus on possibilities and ways to use the law and design to achieve new
and more ambitious goals, not just to remove barriers and resolve or
prevent problems. To turn this vision into action, we need to set goals,
navigate the legal landscape, move from thinking to doing and improve
individuals’ self-care by promoting their financial and legal literacy. This
will lead to positive outcomes, such as legal empowerment, optimal
functioning, and improved access to justice.6

   As with all human-centred design, our proposed approach seeks pos-
itive solutions that take into account people’s different characteristics.7
This is necessary if we want to empower people and promote their legal
self-care. Rather than the passive transfer of information – which is often
the case with conventional legal drafting and documents – this requires
knowledge of user needs, technological possibilities and the context in
which the user will make sense of the information provided.8 As with
design in general, user needs are put at the core, and, where appropri-
ate, technology is used to respond to the needs of different audiences.
The Nobel laureate Richard H. Thaler uses the term ‘choice architecture’
to refer to the practical fact that how the environment in which people
make decisions is designed affects the decisions they make.9 In other

words, design is not about decorating, it has a huge impact on people’s
decisions and their outcomes.

  A search on SSRN or Google Scholar for topics such as proactive law,
proactive legal design, legal health or legal well-being will reveal re-
sources related to research, particularly in the Nordic countries, that
shows how design can help bring future-oriented legal thinking into
practice. Scholars of proactive/preventive law and proactive legal design
have for some time seen lawyers not only as fighters or problem-solvers,
but also as planners and designers. Moving beyond problem-solving
thinking, they have applied foresight and design in their search for de-
sirable futures, legal well-being and the common good. In this paper we
build on the work of these scholars and expand our radar to cover two
specific areas of application, namely, 1) sustainability disclosure and re-
porting, and 2) sustainable and responsible business-to-business (B2B)
contracting, both of which are highlighted in the new EU sustainability
legislation.

1.2. Towards Action: Merging Possibility-Driven Legal Design with AI

According to the Legal Design Alliance (LeDA), legal design is about using
human-centred design in the legal domain to facilitate positive results
and proactively address issues before they escalate into conflicts and
disputes.10 Based on this definition, legal design aligns with the essence
of possibility-driven thinking. Legal design encourages interdisciplinary
cooperation and places emphasis on the perspectives of all users, not
just lawyers, judges, and regulators.11 In order to ‘make the legal system
work better for people’,12 legal design has very practical goals. It seeks

     Happiness (Yale University Press 2008).
10 See The Legal Design Alliance, ‘What is legal design?’ <www.legaldesignalliance.
     org/> accessed 31 August 2023. LeDA, according to the website, is ‘a network
     of lawyers, designers, technologists, academics, and other professionals who
     are committed to making the legal system more human-centered and effective,
     through the use of design’.

to make the best of law and legal information. In the context of legal
information, the core topic of this paper, this includes using information
design tools and methods such as visualisation and simplification.13 Here
the perspective is closely linked to the goals of proactive law: enabling
and empowering people to make better choices and have clarity about
their rights and responsibilities.

   This paper highlights the opportunities of legal design by linking it to
the promotive dimension of the proactive approach. Moreover, if the
aim is to make legal information work better, the focus must be on ac-
tion. Rather than simply aiming for human-readable information, we
should be more ambitious and aim for human-actionable information
– something that is actually likely to be used and implemented by the
target audience.14 AI, together with more traditional legal design tools,
can help achieve this goal.

   The potential of new technologies is well recognised in the field of le-
gal design.15 In the context of information design, AI tools can assist both
readers and writers of legal information. For example, language models
such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT can generate simplified summaries of long
texts and translate legalese into human language (and vice versa). Our
examples here and elsewhere16 show that AI-powered writing assistants

can also generate helpful first drafts of contract and clause summaries,
explanations and reports. As AI tools have certain limitations, which are
described later in Section 3.4, we argue that the role of human experts
as responsible users of AI is crucial. In this way, AI tools can make a sig-
nificant contribution to making information more actionable.

1.3. Possibility-Driven Design for Better Contracts, Better Business and a
Better Society

Contracts play an important role in business, not only as a legal tool but
also as a management tool. Contract negotiation can help to identify
and align expectations and clarify objectives, roles and responsibilities.
When used in this way, contracts can help reduce the risk of unnecessary
misunderstandings and disputes. They can be used proactively to pro-
mote what is desirable and prevent what is not.

  The proactive approach to law in fact originated in the context of
contracting. The first publication in the field was ‘Quality Improvement
through Proactive Contracting’ in 1998, written by one of the authors of
this paper.17 In the beginning, the approach was about using contracts
to merge quality and risk management with preventive legal thinking
in order for the parties to reach their business objectives and prevent
problems and negative surprises. The goal, according to Pohjonen, was
to ensure that the contracting parties achieve their desired results in
accordance with their intentions; this requires a thorough examination
of their goals and intentions and the ability to create a clear and legally
sound framework for their implementation.18

   The early adopters of proactive contracting wanted to shift the view
of contracts from merely legal tools to operational tools, with a focus
on their users, especially people in charge of contract implementation.19
When searching for ways to create contracts that are both legally and
operationally functional and user-friendly, the pioneers of the approach
were informed by insights from information design about matters such
as people’s literacy proficiencies, reading habits, information process-
ing and overload, understanding and memory. Merging these learnings
with proactive legal thinking and putting users at the centre became the
mission, and proactive legal thinkers and information designers became
natural allies. Proactive contract design was born. It was applied not only
in the context of the design of contract documents – their content, struc-
ture, language, and presentation – but also in the design of contracting
processes and their integration into business processes.20

   The thinking, tools and methods were tested in a number of projects
and contexts, which provided proof of concept beyond the domain of
contracts. The first Legal Design Jam events21 conducted in 2013 showed

19 A proactive contract has been described as one ‘crafted for the parties, especially
     for the people in charge of its implementation in the field, not for a judge who is
     supposed to decide about the parties’ failures’ in Gerlinde Berger-Walliser, Robert
     C Bird and Helena Haapio, ‘Promoting Business Success through Contract Visualiza-
     tion’ (2011) 17 Journal of Law, Business & Ethics 55, 61. The authors note that most
     contracts are not crafted in this way. Instead, they ‘contain concepts and language
     that non-lawyers often find overly complicated, obscure, and unappealing. This is
     because most contracts seem to be written by lawyers for lawyers’ (ibid 56). Chris
     Simkins calls such contracts ‘lawyer-to-lawyer’ or ‘L2L contracts’ – contracts where
     ‘it’s lawyers that lead the process of writing, reading, negotiating and finalising
     the contract documents on both sides’ (Chris Simkins, ‘L2L Contracts: Thinking be-
     yond B2C and B2B’ (Improving Contracts. Blog) <https://improvingcontracts.com/

that contracts, conventions, policies, licences and legal information need
not be boring, complex and inaccessible, and that designing engaging
legal communication is possible even with a limited, or no budget.

  Contracts have a significant impact on better business and a better
society, too. Better contracts can help businesses and supply chains op-
erate more effectively and sustainably, and contribute to a better soci-
ety by promoting responsible business and procurement practices. For
example, contracts can be used for setting ESG (Environmental, Social,
and Governance) goals and improving transparency and accountability
in transactions and relationships. In recent years, the proactive contract-
ing approach has broadened to also include the promotion of societal
goals, aiming at achieving and maintaining environmental, social and
economic well-being for present and future generations. Responsible
and sustainable contracting has emerged as a topic of growing interest
in research and practice.22

  Recently, the EU has proposed a plethora of new legislation related to
sustainability. These proposals are well-intentioned and aim to make the
EU’s ambitious sustainability goals a reality. At the same time, they will
impose a heavy burden of new and increased reporting requirements on
companies. They will also force companies to review their procurement
and contracting practices throughout their value chains. We will explore
how possibility-driven design and AI can work together to help investors
make better investment decisions, help companies meet their new sus-
tainability reporting requirements, and drive sustainable and responsi-

2. Sustainability and the Need for Tools to Help Navigate the Legal
Landscape

2.1. Managing the Flood of New Legislation on Sustainability

Sustainability is at the heart of the European Union. In particular, it is
guided by the European Green Deal, which is a comprehensive and am-
bitious set of sustainability objectives for the Union. The most important
goal is to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
Climate Law (EU) 2021/111923 makes this target legally binding on EU
Institutions and Member States. In addition, there are a number of sub-
goals, such as clean water, energy efficiency, and healthy food.24 The
Green Deal also implements the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and the
UN Sustainable Development Goals.25 These global goals include, among
others, ending poverty and hunger, achieving gender equality, and tak-
ing urgent action to combat climate change.26

   To translate sustainability goals into action, investors, citizens and
other stakeholders need information on the sustainability efforts of
companies and other actors. However, the Corporate Sustainability Re-
porting Directive (CSRD) EU 2022/246427 identifies a gap between users’
information needs and the sustainability information provided by com-

panies. This gap is expected to widen if no action is taken. This would
have significant negative consequences, such as the inability of investors
to take sustainability into account when making investment decisions,
and potential systemic risks that could even threaten financial stability.
Without adequate information and a common understanding of what is
‘sustainable’, it is difficult to hold companies and other actors accounta-
ble for their impacts on the environment, people and society. The lack of
common measures and definitions will also make it difficult for compa-
nies to assess, manage and respond to their sustainability efforts.28

  Legislation is an important tool for achieving sustainability goals. As a
result, the EU has recently issued a wealth of new regulations, directives
and legislative proposals related to sustainability. To name just a few,
the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/85229 provides a classification
framework for sustainable activities. It provides a definition of ‘environ-
mentally sustainable’ economic activities and new disclosure require-
ments. Standardised definitions and measures are intended to prevent
‘greenwashing’, the marketing of products as environmentally friendly,
when they are not.30 The CSRD also introduces new and much broader
reporting requirements for companies. In addition, the Sustainable Fi-
nance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)31 imposes new disclosure require-
ments for financial market participants and financial advisors at both the
company and product level.

  The proposal for a Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Dili-
gence (CSDDD) recognises the role of companies’ day-to-day activities in
achieving sustainability goals. The proposed Directive covers large com-
panies as well as listed companies.32 It aims to ensure that companies

identify and, where necessary, prevent, end or mitigate adverse impacts
not only of their own and their subsidiaries’ operations, but also of their
business partners in their supply chains.

   In addition to several more substance-related legislative proposals,
such as proposals for a Nature Restoration Law33 and a Regulation on
Deforestation-Free Products34, the EU has also created benchmarks,
standards, and labels to help identify sustainable products. As the stand-
ards and labels are based on the EU Taxonomy, they will increase in-
tegrity and trust in the sustainable financial market and make it easier
for investors to find sustainable investments. For example, the proposed
European Green Bond Regulation sets a standard for high-quality green
bonds.35 Benchmarks are also useful tools for investors, as they allow
them to measure and track the performance of assets and set alloca-
tions accordingly. 36

   Despite the growing need for sustainability information, the results of
a European Commission study have shown that this demand is not being
met. 37 Sustainability information is not easily accessible and digitally us-
able by public authorities in their supervisory and regulatory role, or by
investors, financial professionals, consumers and other audiences. While
new disclosure requirements, such as the EU Taxonomy, SFDR and CSRD,
will increase the transparency of sustainability information, they will also
increase the need for information accessibility. With its proposal for the
European Single Access Point (ESAP) Regulation, the European Commis-
sion aims to bring ‘simplification and improved efficiency’ to sustainabil-
ity information, by streamlining disclosure channels. The ESAP will be a

central platform that gathers public information, including sustainability
information, in one place.38

2.2. The Link between Better Business and Better Society

While climate and nature issues typically dominate in sustainability dis-
cussions, it is important to note that sustainability also has social and
economic components. The key elements of sustainability are often de-
scribed by the acronym ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and
Governance.39 Economic sustainability is necessary in order to have the
resources to invest in other aspects of sustainability, such as companies
looking after their supply chains. Accordingly, better business and a bet-
ter society are intrinsically linked.

  Sustainability goals cannot be achieved without adequate financing.
According to the Green Deal, the private sector is the key to financing
the green transition.40 The EU has given sustainable finance a central role
in achieving its sustainability goals. There is a huge need for additional
investment to meet the targets, and the Sustainable Finance Framework
aims to help with this. The Framework consists of three building blocks:
1) a classification system, or ‘taxonomy’, of sustainable activities, 2) dis-
closures that provide investors with the necessary information on sus-
tainability, and 3) tools, such as benchmarks and standards.41 The goal of
these is to prevent greenwashing. Because of the business value of sus-
tainability, companies can gain undeserved advantages by making false
sustainability claims.42 This, in turn, can reduce the motivation of other
companies to act sustainably. So false sustainability claims can actually
lead to worse business and a worse society.

   Accurate information and standardised definitions are therefore at the
heart of the EU’s efforts to promote sustainability. However, transpar-
ency alone cannot solve all sustainability problems, and there are many
new obligations related to more concrete actions, such as greenhouse
gas reduction and energy efficiency. In the following Sections, we will
explore how sustainability disclosures and reporting, as well as sustaina-
ble and responsible contracting, can promote sustainability. Easy access
to reliable sustainability information can greatly facilitate sustainable
investment decisions. Sustainability requirements can also be incorpo-
rated into commercial contracts.43

2.3. Sustainability Reporting and Investor Disclosures to Promote Sustainable
Investment

Investors need reliable sustainability information in order to make invest-
ment decisions that promote sustainability. Companies will also benefit
from sustainability information because it can help them access finan-
cial capital and manage their own sustainability risks and opportunities.
In addition, it can serve as a basis for better communication between
companies and their stakeholders.44 Most sustainability information is
derived from companies’ sustainability reporting and disclosures.

   Despite the new EU legislation, sustainability reporting is not a new
phenomenon. EU companies have been required to report on sustain-
ability under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive 2014/95/EU.45 How-
ever, the term ‘non-financial’ is confusing and imprecise, giving the
impression that sustainability information has no financial relevance.46
The CSRD makes sustainability reporting both broader and more stand-
ardised than before. It also aims to ensure the comparability of sus-
tainability information and disclosure of all the relevant information.
Machine-readability is an important objective as well, as it will facilitate
the use of the future ESAP platform.

  The SFDR requires financial market participants and financial advisors
to disclose specific sustainability information to end investors. Identi-
fying clients’ sustainability preferences is now part of the duties of in-
vestment advisors. This should make sustainability more visible in the
advisory process and increase the demand for sustainable investment
products. The new EU legislation also aims to help investors identify
sustainable investments. Therefore, the term ‘sustainable investment’
is harmonised in the SFDR. According to Article 2, sustainable invest-
ments contribute to environmental objectives as measured, for exam-
ple, through key resource efficiency indicators on energy use, waste
generation and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable investments can
also contribute to social objectives, such as reducing inequality or pro-
moting social inclusion.

  In financial market law, the typical way to protect retail investors is to
impose information requirements on those who have superior knowledge
– typically companies and financial firms, as is also the case with sus-
tainability information. This approach implicitly assumes that people are
fairly rational and will read and digest the information they receive. It
also homogenises retail investors, lumping them together as one large
group of investors who all benefit from the same type of information.

  Financial literacy studies can provide some insight into the average per-
son’s ability to use investment disclosures. These studies have shown that
people’s financial literacy is generally low. According to the OECD’s defi-
nition, financial literacy consists of three main components: knowledge,
behaviour and attitudes – i.e., it encompasses the aspects from thinking
to doing.47 The OECD has also measured financial well-being – a state of
being in which individuals have control over their day-to-day finances,
are able to cope with financial shocks, are able to achieve their financial
goals and have the freedom to make choices that enable them to enjoy

50 % of the maximum), meaning that financial situation does not con-
tribute positively to well-being, but rather causes stress and worry. There
are also especially vulnerable investor groups that have been shown to
have more difficulty with financial literacy and financial well-being. For
example, young people (aged 18–29) scored lower on financial literacy.
They had lower levels of financial knowledge and less prudent financial
behaviour. At the other end of the spectrum, seniors (age 60 and over)
also had lower financial literacy and financial well-being scores.49

   High levels of financial literacy are associated with better economic
outcomes and help people make day-to-day financial decisions as well
as in long-term financial activities.50 The perspectives of financial literacy
and financial well-being are consistent with the goals of legal literacy,
legal well-being, and legal design. They take into account the ‘thinking to
doing’ approach and differences among individuals, and they focus on
well-being rather than problems. However, these goals and perspectives
have not yet materialised in investor disclosures and company reporting.
Loughran and McDonald noted that investors do not read company an-
nual reports. In fact, usually, they do not even open them.51

   The core problem may be that reports and disclosures are typically
written in a way that does not encourage or entice us to read them.
The European Commission found in its study that the current investor
disclosure framework is limited in what it can achieve, as current disclo-
sures are not ‘engaging’.52 According to the Commission, engagement

is a precondition for reading and understanding disclosures, and mak-
ing decisions based on them. While attention is paid to the availability
and accessibility of information, the current framework does not help
to make the documents engaging enough to capture the attention of
users. Although standardisation of terms and measures will help to im-
prove understanding, it cannot overcome the difficulties arising from the
complexity of the terminology used. The European Commission states
that even when this complexity is presented in a standardised way, it still
does ‘inhibit understanding’.53 Later in this paper, we propose strategies
and tools to solve this problem.

2.4. Sustainable and Responsible Contracting

The CSDDD proposal mentioned in Section 2.1 as an example of the flood
of EU legislation on sustainability notes the critical role that contracts
and procurement practices play in promoting sustainability throughout
global value chains.54 Its proposed Article 7 in its original form required
companies to seek ‘contractual assurances’ from their direct business
partners that they will comply with the company’s code of conduct and
that such ‘assurances’ may also be sought from the business partners of
business partners that are part of the company’s value chain.

  It has been suggested that companies could fulfil many of their obliga-
tions under the originally proposed CSDDD by simply including clauses
in their contracts requiring suppliers to follow their Code of Conduct.
There has been wide criticism that this is going to lead to ‘tick-the-box
compliance’ and that the required ‘contractual assurances’ would have
allowed companies to pass on their responsibilities to their suppliers.55

In December 2023, the Council and the European Parliament reached
a provisional agreement on the CSDDD. The wording of Article 7 in this
version of the CSDDD has changed somewhat, but it contains a similar
obligation to seek and establish contractual assurances.56

   The discussion around the CSDDD proposal has brought today’s pro-
curement practices and contracts to the fore and drawn attention to
how contracts are currently used and how they could be used in the
future. Contracts have been seen in a new light, and growing attention
has been paid by scholars and practitioners to the various purposes and
functions of contracts. A similar discussion had already started, particu-
larly among the promoters of proactive legal thinking, before sustainable
and responsible contracting became a thing.57

   Despite all the potential benefits that contracts can offer, research and
practice tell us that contracts do not always work for the purposes they
are expected to serve. The contract law duty to read contracts is not re-
alistic. In commercial practice, contracts are not necessarily read – and

are even less likely to be understood by people who lack legal training.58
This problem has been known for quite some time, especially in the con-
text of consumer contracts: they are not engaging, and readers give up
before starting to read. The problems and their causes are well known
and widely researched.59 Yet they persist in practice. The world of con-
tracts – or contract research – does not change quickly. Apart from the
proponents of proactive legal thinking and design, there has been much
more academic work on the problems than on the solutions.

  Contracts can be a powerful tool to promote, measure and monitor
sustainability in supply chains. But if contracts remain unread, they fail
to achieve this goal. This is where design comes in. The fields of legal de-
sign and contract design help legal and business professionals improve
communications, services and solutions by applying design mindsets,
tools and methods.

3. Strategies and Tools to Promote Sustainability

3.1. Possibility-Driven Design Solutions

According to the European Commission, disclosure is ‘a necessary but
insufficient means to support retail investors in making their choice’, for
reasons that were explained in Section 2.3.60 Possibility-driven design
can make a significant contribution to overcoming these challenges. It is

     Annotation Framework’ (2022) 62 Jurimetrics Journal 225, 236. See also Berger-
     Walliser and others (n 19) 56: ‘too many contracts that are much too long require
     more reading time than most managers can afford…. So business people may enter
     into contracts every day without examining them.’ See also Simkins (n 19).

not enough for users of sustainability information to pay more attention
to sustainability – sustainability needs to be moved from thinking to do-
ing, taking action, in order to advance the goals of the Green Deal.

   In this Section, we introduce some of the more prominent tools and
give examples of how they can be used. First, we will discuss design pat-
terns, which provide solutions for communicating complex information
more clearly and in a way that is more likely to be read, understood
and acted upon.61 Templates and models can also facilitate the task of
communicating effectively. In addition, responsible use of AI can help
address the challenges of sustainability communication and contracting.
For example, it can help draft summaries and explanations and present
key information in a more engaging way. It can also make it easier to find
information in large amounts of data. So, AI can help both readers and
writers of contracts, sustainability reports and disclosures. However, the
limitations and risks related to AI tools must also be taken into account,
and they will be discussed later.

   One of the problems with investor disclosures identified in the Euro-
pean Commission study mentioned above is that there is typically little
focus on the environment and context in which the disclosure is used.
Taking these into account would encourage investors to use and act on
the information.62 Possibility-driven design and AI tools can help con-
textualise and personalise sustainability information, for example, by
changing its mass formatting or tone of voice to a personalised version,
adjusting to the knowledge level of an individual and adapting the con-
tent and presentation accordingly.63

   As one of the aims of this paper is to move from vision to action – from
(design) thinking to doing – in order to genuinely promote sustainability,
we argue for the need to move from merely drafting communications to
designing communications and to consider the needs of different user
groups. This is also a prerequisite for better legal literacy and self-care.

  In summary, we argue that design solutions have the potential to close
the ‘engagement’ gap identified in the context of contracts and other
complex information, such as disclosures. Legal design is based on the
vision of a legal system that is more straightforward, more engaging,
and more user-friendly, including the way information is presented.64 To-
gether with AI, possibility-driven legal design can help to overcome the
communication challenges of sustainability information and serve as a
foundation for sustainable action.

3.2. Design Patterns

Design patterns and pattern libraries have been used in various fields,
including architecture, software engineering and UX design, as a way
to share design knowledge. Design patterns can be defined as reusable
models of a solution to frequently occurring problems in a domain. They
also exist in the domains of legal design and contract design.65 The use
of patterns can help communicate design concepts and provide effective
solutions to design problems.

  In the context of contracts, the WorldCC Contract Design Pattern Li-
brary66 provides design principles and real-world examples of how the
patterns have been implemented. A design pattern is not a ready-made

template or a finished design, but rather a model approach that pro-
vides guidance and examples for identifying a problem and developing
a solution. The design pattern should not be strictly followed – instead,
it should be adapted to meet the needs of the designer, the context and
the audience.

   Let’s take an example: different readers and contexts can be accom-
modated with layering, which can be used both online and offline. With
layering, the same information is presented in different ways, depending
on the needs and capabilities of the audience. Creative Commons Li-
cences are an early example of layering. Their three-layer design consists
of the Legal Code layer – the typical ‘lawyer-readable’ version of the text;
the Commons Deed – the ‘human readable’ version of the licence; and
finally, the ‘machine readable’ version, which allows search engines and
other technologies to ‘understand’ and interact with the licence terms.67
With layering, it is possible to help readers avoid information overload:
key information is quickly and easily findable, while details are available
‘on demand’ for those who want or need them. Layering is a good prac-
tice to support strategic reading.68 A layered layout with multiple head-
ings can help make the content easier to understand by breaking it down
into smaller, more digestible sections. In this way, layering can promote
transparency and facilitate acting upon information.

   Adding explanations or summaries is particularly promising in our
context. However, not everyone is enthusiastic about them. In a 2018
study, Uri Benoliel and Samuel Becher examined 500 widely-used web-
sites’ sign-in-wrap agreements and found that 22 included explanations
or clarifications of the agreement or some of its terms, and 19 provided
a summary just before the full contract terms. While such approaches
may make the terms less tedious to read and arguably more memorable,

     ferent ‘pattern families’ that each have several patterns. There are currently eight
     different patterns in the layering ‘pattern family’, namely accordion, clause sum-
     maries, exemplar, guidance notes, skimmable headings, swim lanes, term sheet
     and user guide format, all with examples from real-world contracts. WorldCC Foun-
     dation, Passera and Haapio (n 61).
226  Marika Salo-Lahti and Helena Haapio

they raise several concerns, according to the authors. First, readers may
be unsure about what they are supposed to read: the formal terms, the
annotations, or both, and what parts of the text are legally binding. In
the event of a legal dispute, should courts favour one type of text over
another? Moreover, the authors ask, might such a text cause consumers
to become less vigilant and not fully aware of the legal risks and obliga-
tions of the contract?

  While the concerns raised by Benoliel and Becher are valid in the con-
text of consumer contracts, they may not carry the same weight in the
context of this paper: B2B contracts, where parties typically have more
experience with and understanding of contracts.69 In addition, the Beno-
liel and Becher article discusses a specific and narrow (though common)
category of consumer standard form contracts: sign-in-wrap contracts,
where consumers are asked to agree to the terms and conditions of a
website. Web wrap contracts and complex B2B contracts serve funda-
mentally different purposes and audiences. The latter type of contracts
often include hundreds if not thousands of obligations and detailed busi-
ness and financial terms that not only need to be understood by the par-
ties but also adhered to and potentially passed along the supply chain.

  Some organisations and lawyers may wish their contracts and terms to
remain unread – proactive lawyers think and act differently, using expla-
nations to achieve greater transparency, efficiency and understanding,
and adding clarifications, interpretation clauses and other contractual
devices to reduce potential confusion about what to read and what
parts of the text are legally binding.70 On the question of how courts

69 Still they may be reluctant to read contracts. See Section 2.4, with references.
70 For interpretation clauses, see Chapter 3 in Marcel Fontaine and Filip de Ly, Draft-

     ing International Contracts: An Analysis of Contract Clauses (Brill 2009). One possi-
     ble solution is to design contracts where all of their component parts are intended
     to be equally valid and part of the legally binding contract. For Composite Comic
     Contracts, which consist of images, text and a voice-over, see Anne Ketola, Robert
     de Rooy and Helena Haapio, ‘Comic Contracts 2.0 – Contracts that Have (and Give)
     a Voice’ in this volume. For suggestions related to the interpretation of images in
     contracts, see also Vesa Annola, Helena Haapio and Merja Koskela, ‘Interpreting

should interpret the different types of text, it is important to note that in
most jurisdictions the interpretation of contracts involves looking at the
intention of the parties. Clear explanations can help demonstrate the in-
tention behind certain provisions, particularly in cases where traditional
legal language may be ambiguous.

3.3. Templates and Models

Contract drafting rarely starts with a blank sheet of paper. Rather, it be-
gins with a template, form or model, or with a clause library. In today’s
contract practice, clauses and Codes of Conduct that address sustaina-
bility issues are frequently used. Where companies choose not to ne-
gotiate such clauses individually with each supplier, the clauses can be
made part of standard terms and conditions. These tend to favour the
buyer, due to the fact that there is often a major imbalance in the bar-
gaining power between the buying companies and their suppliers. A new
approach has been taken in the Model Contract Clauses known as ABA
MCCs 2.071 produced by a Working Group of the Business Law Section
of the American Bar Association. The same Working Group has also pro-
duced a model Buyer Code of Conduct called the ‘Responsible Purchas-
ing Code of Conduct’.72 Based on these models, the leading members
of the Working Group established the Responsible Contracting Project
(RCP) in 2022, with the mission to improve human rights in global supply
chains through innovative contracting practices. Following its mission,
the RCP develops and disseminates ‘practical contractual tools to sup-
port more cooperative relations between supply chain firms and better

human rights outcomes for workers’.73 It has developed a toolkit, ‘the
Responsible Contracting Toolkit’, seeking to operationalise and imple-
ment the Responsible Contracting Principles, which challenge the short-
comings of traditional contracting, such as supplier-only responsibility.74

  Templates, guidance and model clauses are expected to be provided
by the EU as well. In order to improve the comparability of sustainability
disclosures, the European Commission has already formulated standard-
ised disclosure templates in its Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/128875,
which specifies the SFDR. Articles 12 and 13 of the CSDDD state that the
Commission will provide guidance for model contract clauses and may
also issue guidelines for specific sectors or specific adverse impacts.

  A European working group has recently published a draft of European
Model Clauses (EMCs) for supply chains and has sought input on these
clauses. Building on the ABA MCCs 2.0, their goal is to adapt the clauses
to the European context and ensure that they comply with EU law and
national contract law systems.76 Adaptations may be required for some
countries, but the European working group intends to develop general
EMCs in order to accommodate the desire of many companies to use the

same clauses across Europe: the EMCs are expected to indicate where
specific legal systems require specific adaptations.77

   Other initiatives in the area of model contract clauses include the Chan-
cery Lane Project78 for climate-aligned clauses and the Sustainable Terms
of Trade Initiative (STTI)79, a manufacturer-driven initiative focused on
creating fairer purchasing practices in the textile and garment industry.
Further initiatives are underway. However, many of these model clauses
tend to be written by lawyers for other lawyers80 and would benefit from
a more user-centric design.

   Reading, writing and (re)designing these templates and models is not
an easy task. Next, we will look at how AI tools such as GPT-4 or ChatGPT
could help, and how we could implement these tools responsibly.

3.4. Responsible Use of AI tools for Sustainability

3.4.1. Managing the Challenges of Generative AI
In its Sustainable Finance Strategy, the European Commission states that
digital technologies can provide ‘essential solutions for citizens, investors
and SMEs to carry out their transition to sustainability’. The Commission
encourages the use of innovative solutions to support retail investors’
understanding of the sustainability of investment products. Therefore,
technological innovation, including AI, has an important role to play in
sustainable finance.81 Similarly, the Commission’s White Paper on Arti-
ficial Intelligence states that digital technologies, such as AI, are critical
enablers for achieving the goals of the Green Deal. At the same time, AI
poses risks, such as opaque decision making and different types of dis-
crimination.82 New innovations will also put more pressure on people’s

digital financial literacy. Investors and other users will need some techni-
cal knowledge and skills to understand and use new technologies.83

  ChatGPT and GPT-4 are part of generative AI, which is a subset of AI
that generates content such as text, images, audio, or video, resem-
bling closely human-created content.84 Applications based on generative
AI are already widely used. For instance, ChatGPT became the fastest
growing digital service ever, reaching 100 million users two months after
launching.85 AI-based applications affect people everywhere, from so-
cial media postings to the decisions about who will receive state ben-
efits. If AI contains biases, it might have negative consequences even
for our fundamental rights, if significant decisions are made based on
algorithms that are biased against certain groups of people.86

  Despite its great popularity and potential, generative AI has its risks
and challenges. In addition to potential biases, the Norwegian Consumer
Council divides the harms and challenges of generative AI into several
categories: structural challenges; manipulation; discrimination, and
content moderation; privacy and data protection; security vulnerabili-
ties and fraud; replacing humans in consumer-facing applications with
generative AI; environmental impacts; labour impacts; and intellectual
property challenges.87

  Intellectual property challenges relate both to image-generating tools
and large language models (LLMs). According to Strowel, there are al-
ready at least five cases, mostly class actions, filed in the US and UK
against generative AI. These cases mainly involve tools for creating
graphic material.88 In LLMs, training data can include copyrighted mate-
rials. Some models are transparent regarding their training data sources,

while others do not provide source information. Now, some solutions to
this problem have been developed, such as the Kelvin Legal DataPack,
which obtains data only from sources with clear intellectual property
rights that explicitly allow the reuse of data for commercial purposes.89
Microsoft, which is currently integrating its Copilot AI assistant into
many of its software offerings, has announced that it has content filters
and other technology in place to reduce the likelihood of copyright in-
fringement, and has promised to defend its Copilot enterprise custom-
ers against copyright lawsuits.90

   In addition to intellectual property rights, the risks associated with
the practical use of GPT models include hallucinations and errors, incon-
sistent responses, lack of metacognition and statistical understanding,
and lack of verifiability and reasoning. 91 Data privacy and the protection
of minors have also been important concerns.92 Age verification tools
would prevent underage users from accessing generative AI models. In
regard to privacy concerns, for example, Microsoft Azure93 and ChatGPT
Enterprise94 promise to provide data privacy for their AI tools.

   The widely cited challenges have not deterred us from exploring gen-
erative AI tools and encouraging others to do so. For us, the challenges

mean that we need to be aware of the potential risks and challenges and
act accordingly, primarily by having a knowledgeable human expert re-
view and editing the output before it is accepted, distributed, and acted
upon.95 We have used generative AI under the close control and supervi-
sion of a human. The role of humans as users of AI tools and as reviewers
and editors of input (prompts) and output is critical, and typically not
well recognised when discussing the use of AI tools. In prompts, users
can significantly guide the output, for example by asking for references
and indicating what type of output is preferred and what is not. Rather
than automating decision making or producing final versions, we have
successfully used AI to suggest topics, headings and ideas, and to pro-
vide initial drafts. Used in this way, we have found that generative AI
can greatly increase efficiency, while human oversight helps to address
challenges such as bias and error.

  Regulation is also an important response to the challenges of AI. Leg-
islation on generative AI is emerging, and some of the existing EU legis-
lation may also be applicable, depending on the context. For example,
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)96 applies to generative
AI applications in relation to personal data, and the Unfair Commer-
cial Practices Directive (UCPD)97 may address misleading or aggressive
commercial practices using generative AI. Among the emerging EU reg-
ulations, the proposed AI Act is also important from a generative AI per-
spective.98 The Parliament’s position on the AI Act, which was adopted
in June 2023, includes so-called foundation models in the proposal. Pro-
viders of foundation models, including GPT, would be required to ensure
the protection of fundamental rights, health and safety and the environ-

ment, democracy and the rule of law. Providers would also have to ad-
equately assess and mitigate risks, comply with design, information and
environmental requirements and register with the EU database. There
are specific obligations for providers of foundation models of generative
AI. These specific obligations relate to transparency, training, design and
development of the model so that it does not generate illegal content.
A sufficiently detailed summary of the use of copyrighted training data
must also be published.99 In this way, once applied, the AI Act can make
AI tools more accurate and safer. However, the role of users in terms of
the input and output will remain critical.

3.4.2. Examples of Using Generative AI Tools
AI, including machine learning, enables the processing of legal infor-
mation, disclosures and contracts as data. While it can analyse massive
amounts of data, it can also provide valuable information about what
is typical, ‘standard’ or ‘average’ in a given set of circumstances. For ex-
ample, there are AI tools designed to assist in the analysis of contracts
and identify terms that deviate from what is considered customary or
desirable in a particular industry or jurisdiction. Contract analysis and
review tools can scan contracts and flag unusual or undesirable clauses
for review. Such AI tools have been commercially available for several
years, while generative AI tools are of more recent origin.100 Whether the
work is done by humans or AI, the contracting parties will benefit, when
contract terms and disclosures are better read and understood. From a
preventive standpoint, this can lead to a reduction in misunderstand-
ings, disputes and litigation.101 From a promotive perspective, it can also
lead to more sustainable investments, better contracts and better busi-
ness – all of which contribute to a better society.

  Recently, there has been a significant shift in AI’s ability to process
text. Arbel and Becher explored the capabilities of GPT-3 models to act
as ‘smart readers’ of contracts, disclosures, and privacy policies. They
identified four core capabilities of smart readers: they can simplify and
summarise complex legal text; personalise the text based on the char-
acteristics of the reader; interpret contract terms; and benchmark and
rank contracts based on their quality.102

  We have been testing OpenAI’s GPT models in the field, particularly in
the context of contracts and sustainability reporting. Figure 1 shows the
potential we have found that generative AI such as Open AI’s ChatGPT
already has in the context of contract planning and design. In addition
to providing translations from one language to another, it seems to be
able to provide overviews and suggestions based on available informa-
tion and help us to draft, summarise, explain and present contracts and
contract clauses.

   In the following, we present examples of our testing of OpenAI’s GPT-
4’s ability to help us navigate sustainability legislation, suggest con-
tract topics and ideas, and present initial drafts of contract content and
presentation.

  The European Union has recently finalized the Corporate Sustainability Reporting
  Directive (CSRD) that will introduce more detailed sustainability reporting require-
  ments for companies operating within the EU, as well as non-EU companies that
  meet certain criteria related to their net turnover in the EU and companies with
  securities listed on a regulated EU market. The CSRD came into force on January 5,
  2023, and the rules will be gradually implemented starting from January 1, 2024, for
  certain large EU and EU-listed companies, with the aim of applying to all in-scope
  companies by January 1, 2028.
  The CSRD is part of a larger legislative package aimed at promoting corporate sus-
  tainability and a green economy, with other major European initiatives including
  the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.
  Further progress is expected in 2023 regarding related legislative and regulatory in-
  itiatives, including the Directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence and the
  EU Green Bond Standard.
  Under the CSRD, companies must disclose how sustainability-related factors, such
  as climate change, affect their operations and how their business model impacts
  sustainability factors. The scope of required reporting covers environmental, social
  and human rights, and governance factors. Specifically, environmental factors in-
  clude climate (including Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions), water/ma-
  rine resources, circular economy, pollution, and biodiversity. Companies are also re-
  quired to disclose their plans to ensure that their business models and strategies are
  compatible with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C in line with the Paris
  Agreement and the EU’s own European Climate Law, which aims to achieve climate
  neutrality by 2050.
  Regarding supplier contracts, the CSRD requires companies to disclose information
  about their value chain, including their own operations, products and services, busi-
  ness relationships, and supply chain where applicable. Companies are also required
  to disclose the due diligence processes they have implemented concerning sustain-
  ability matters, including any actions they have taken to prevent or mitigate any
  actual or potential adverse impacts related to their activities. However, I was unable
  to find more detailed information about the specific impact of these regulations on
  contracts with suppliers during this search.
  In summary, the EU’s new sustainability legislation imposes substantial new dis-
  closure and compliance requirements on companies, which could influence their
  business relationships and contracts, including those with suppliers. However, more
  research would be needed to detail these impacts more specifically.

  Figure 2 shows an extract from the results of GPT-4, using its built-in
browser and Bing (Beta), when asked to summarise recent and forth-
coming EU legislation and its impact on contracts with suppliers.103 This
simple example demonstrates how AI can be used as an ideation and
reading tool: it can help simplify and summarise text and find the most
relevant information.104 This example also illustrates how at the time of
this test, the GPT-3 knowledge cut-off date, September 2021, was not a
limiting factor: more recent information could be found in the output.
Here GPT-4 correctly stated that the CSRD came into force on January
5, 2023. It also discussed some of the legislative changes expected in
2023. The ‘Finished browsing’ button allowed the viewer to see what
kind of references were ‘clicked’ during the process. The ‘Browse with
Bing’ feature, previously removed, has now been reinstated, enhancing
the verification process and addressing some of the prevalent concerns
with generative AI. GPT-4 also ‘acknowledges’ its shortcomings, noting
that ‘more research would be needed to detail these impacts more spe-
cifically’.

  In our next test, again using OpenAI’s GPT-4 with Bing (Beta), we first
asked GPT-4 to summarise EU reporting requirements related to com-
panies’ and their value chains’ carbon footprint and then, after receiv-
ing the summary, we asked it to explain how it did this, including which
website it visited.105 After receiving a step-by-step description of its
search process, we asked it to suggest what about these reporting re-
quirements a company should include in its contracts with its suppliers

103 We used the following prompt: ‘I am writing an article about new EU sustainability
     legislation and how it impacts (and hopefully improves) investment decision-mak-
     ing and contracts. Can you help me by summarizing how the recent and forthcom-
     ing EU legislation impacts on contracts with suppliers, with references, please?’

     of contracts, see also Arbel and Becher (n 102).

and customers.106 In the response, ChatGPT identified six key points to
consider. These are shown in Figure 3.

  As for what a company should include in its contracts with suppliers and customers,
  it’s critical to include provisions that ensure compliance with the forthcoming re-
  quirements. Here are some points that could be considered:
  Compliance with Regulations: Clauses should be included that require all parties
  to comply with applicable regulations, including the new sustainability reporting
  requirements. This includes any future amendments or additions to these require-
  ments.
  Data Collection and Reporting: Since the reporting requirements might need infor-
  mation from suppliers (such as Scope 3 emissions data), contracts should specify the
  obligations of suppliers to provide necessary data in a timely and accurate manner.
  The same applies to customers if their activities are relevant to the company’s re-
  porting requirements.
  Auditing and Verification: To ensure the accuracy of the data provided by suppliers
  and used in reports, contracts may include the right to audit suppliers or require
  third-party verification of data.
  Liability for Non-compliance: The contracts should clearly outline the consequenc-
  es of non-compliance with the reporting requirements, including potential termina-
  tion of the contract, financial penalties, or other remedial actions.
  Cooperation in Case of Regulatory Inquiry: In case of any regulatory inquiries or
  investigations related to these reporting requirements, the contracts could include
  clauses requiring cooperation between the parties.
  Confidentiality and Data Protection: Given that data sharing is involved, contracts
  should include robust confidentiality and data protection clauses to ensure compli-
  ance with privacy laws and regulations.
  This is a complex issue, and companies should seek legal advice to ensure that their
  contracts are comprehensive and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. The
  exact requirements may also vary depending on the specific circumstances of the
  company and its value chain.

  Next we asked GPT-4 to generate a first draft of a clause to be included
in a contract with suppliers related to item 2 on the list, ‘Data Collection
and Reporting’.107 The clause it generated can be found in Figure 4 under
the heading ‘Full Contractual Clause Text’. As already noted, our tests
were meant to generate first drafts, with a human reviewing, verifying
and editing the output and AI acting as an assistant. For our test pur-
poses, we did not evaluate the output in more detail.

  Finally, we asked GPT-4 to suggest a way to put the contents of the
clause into a table-type format and present it in a layered layout with
FAQ-type headings, a summary or explanation in business language, and
the original full text.108 The result can be found in Figure 4. GPT-4 also
warned us: ‘this table is a guide and may need to be adjusted based on
the specifics of your situation. It’s always a good idea to consult with a
legal professional if you have questions’.

     to be customised to fit the specific circumstances and legal requirements of your
     organisation and location. Always consult with a legal professional before imple-

AI Tools can generate text and a layout that can be used as a draft for
sustainability reports, disclosures or other documents.

  The opportunities offered by AI-powered web translators such as
Google Translate and DeepL Translator109 and writing assistants such
as DeepL Write110 are already widely used by many writers. AI-assisted
translations, explanations and summaries can be used as first drafts in
layering information, in a fraction of the time and and with less effort
than would be required otherwise.111 We expect future AI tools to be
able to generate timelines, flowcharts, swimlanes and other typical
visual design patterns to explain contract clauses.112 While AI tools can-
not take the lead, their outputs can serve as a helpful starting point.

3.4.3. Generative AI in the Field of Legal Language
Large language models, such as Open AI’s GPT-4, Google’s BERT113 and
Cohere’s language models114 are trained on large amounts of data. How-
ever, because the training data contains very general texts, these mod-
els do not always capture the language used in some specific domains.
A significant advantage, though, is that large language models can be
fine-tuned with a relatively small sample of labelled texts. For example,
FinBERT is tuned for financial texts. Huang, Wang and Yang performed
an additional fine-tuning, which resulted in the FinBERT-ESG model. This
model is specialised for ESG-related discussions. The model was trained

sues.115

   The specificity of legal language can be seen as a challenge to the ap-
plication of generative AI in the legal field. Common words can be used
with very specific meanings, and legal language often also uses words
that do not exist in natural language. This means that legal experts are
needed in the development of the AI models.116 However, this challenge
can be overcome, as shown by FinBERT and its subsequent develop-
ment. A number of commercial AI tools are available as well, such as
ContractPodAi’s Leah Legal Copilot, which can, among other things, re-
view and summarise legal documents and provide first drafts, redlines
and extracts.117 Spellbook by Rally can suggest new clauses and entire
sections for contracts, detect aggressive terms, list missing clauses and
definitions and make negotiation suggestions.118 Codify AI, in turn, is a
GPT-4 based tool that is trained to find answers about legislation, so that
legal information can be found and understood quickly and with ease.119
It can also suggest follow-up questions and gives the citation information
used in its answers.

   In addition to monitoring and supervising AI tools and auditing the
algorithms, human experts are also needed to train the tools. This typ-
ically involves building a model and analysing and labelling thousands
of contracts or other documents, depending on what a particular tool
is being asked to perform.120 Even with careful testing, AI tools can still
contain biases and errors. These can be difficult to identify and correct.
Tools that use machine learning are typically ‘black boxes’ – the logic of
their thinking and learning is not visible to their users, and it is difficult to

understand how they make predictions.121 When it comes to using AI in
expert tasks, its trustworthiness is at the core. In addition to technologi-
cal means, trust can be built through legislation, such as the forthcoming
AI Act, discussed above.

4. Conclusions

With its flood of new legislation on sustainability, the EU wants to make
it clear that sustainability is no longer voluntary. It affects both society
and business. The EU’s Sustainable Finance Strategy highlights the im-
portance of sustainable investment in achieving sustainability goals. It
also considers the role of day-to-day business activities and contracts
throughout the whole value chain. Sustainability and business are thus
linked in a meaningful way. Better business can foster a better society.

  With many new legal requirements, the EU is using law as an important
tool to achieve sustainability goals. However, conventional contracts and
legal documents are written primarily to allocate and manage risk and
liability. This often results in dense texts full of legalese – complex legal
language written by lawyers for other lawyers. Studies have shown that
such contracts and documents are not necessarily read or understood.
So, they do not contribute to better business or a better society.

  The proactive approach reverses the mindset. It focuses on future
possibilities rather than past failures. Combined with possibility-driven
design and responsibly used AI tools, it helps move from design thinking
to doing. In the context of sustainability, possibility-driven, AI-assisted
design can help navigate the plethora of sustainability legislation and
overcome many of the problems associated with disclosures, reports
and contracts. These are typically not engaging and are therefore often
ignored by the intended audience. If sustainability information is not ac-
cessed, read and understood, it cannot promote sustainability.

   In the financial context, the importance of financial well-being and
financial literacy is already well recognised.122 Similarly, we should shift
the focus from a problem-oriented approach to legal well-being and le-
gal literacy. In this paper, we have explored how possibility-driven, AI-as-
sisted design can improve sustainability reporting and disclosure, as well
as sustainable and responsible contracting. Using design patterns, tem-
plates, models and AI tools, information can be transformed and com-
municated more effectively, taking into account different user needs.
One-size-fits-all solutions are not sufficient to promote sustainable ac-
tions.

   To address the challenges and risks associated with AI tools, we em-
phasise the role of responsible use of AI tools. Even if the future brings us
‘perfect’ AI regulation and fully compliant AI tools, user risk will remain.
When used responsibly, AI tools make it possible to generate, present
and interact with information in ways that were not possible before. This
opens up significant opportunities for both readers and writers of sus-
tainability information, and possibility-driven legal design can provide
a framework for balancing the needs and expectations of people, busi-
nesses and society at large.

PARTICIPATION IN LEGAL DESIGN

Nina Toivonen and Santiago de Francisco Vela

Abstract
This article discusses the ‘paradox of participation’ in legal design and how to ad-
dress it in practice. Law as a special social function needs multi-level participation,
not only to fulfill its duty in society, but also for its own reflection and inner de-
velopment. However, the legal culture, including classical legal analysis and many
legal practices tend to reject anything ‘non-legal’, making it challenging for both
lawyers, users and other professionals to initiate legal design projects and to en-
gage in them. As described in design literature, putting multi-level participation
into effect is a challenge also in design contexts other than law, and requires spe-
cial mindfulness and methods to succeed. This paper shows how the model of five
critical questions by Joseph Giacomin, the design matrix by Elizabeth Sanders and
Pieter Stappers, and the participation ladder model by Frans Geilfus can be used
to frame legal design projects from the perspective of participation, and to decide
how to incorporate a more participatory approach to them, if desired.

1. Introduction

For Legal Design to establish itself as a unique field of design with a mis-
sion to improve legal systems, it is necessary to develop design methods
that serve the specific purposes and features of law.1 This paper argues
for the fundamental role of participatory design practices2 in Legal De-

sign building on two main insights introduced and discussed in previous
research. The first insight is that designing legal artifacts that are part
of complex social systems requires a multi-level understanding of the
various functions, meanings, and values that the artifacts must gratify to
be usable.3 Such an understanding is best acquired by working together
with users and other stakeholders, as they can not only help build the
technical solution, but also its meaning, acceptability, and effects.4 This
participatory approach goes beyond ‘user-centricity’ or ‘human-centric-
ity’, as it regards users as decision-makers, validators and agents of the
design, not just as information providers.5 The second insight is that al-
though multi-level participation would be a must, engaging lawyers, de-
signers and other stakeholders to design legal artifacts together can be a
particular challenge.6 That may be due to the different - sometimes op-
posite - expectations, understandings and attitudes of lawyers and other
stakeholders towards problem solving, knowledge formulation and the
value of co-work.7 In particular, the legal profession is characterized by its
legal-centric and somewhat exclusive working models.8 Students at law

schools are traditionally trained to analyze and solve problems on their
own, normalizing the expectation of an independent and self-sufficient
legal expert. Also, when practicing their special expertise, to interpret
what is ‘legal’ or ‘illegal,’ lawyers can only turn to authoritative legal in-
formation sources, such as regulations or court rulings. Anything non-le-
gal has little to no value in classical legal analysis.9 Therefore, the idea
of participation embedded in legal design, that legal problems could be
solved with the help of non-legal experts and their non-legal knowledge,
may seem counterintuitive or even irrational for some lawyers.10 If not
adequately addressed and unraveled, this discrepancy between ideals
and reality, or as we call it ‘the paradox of participation’, may hamper the
practice of design in the field of law.

  This paper explores participation in legal design from two field-spe-
cific perspectives – those of law and design. In section 2 we first explain
why a participatory approach to designing law and legal artifacts mat-
ters, and secondly, what may hinder the use of participatory methods in
legal contexts. This overview is built on system-scientific, behavioral and
socio-legal theories, with a twist of our personal experiences and project
descriptions from the legal design field. As noted in previous legal design
studies, systems sciences provide a useful analytical lens to understand
complex human phenomena, such as the relationship between legal sys-
tems and society.11 Systems sciences also support the development of

design philosophy more generally, as design itself is a systemic method,
seeking to create systemic impacts.12

  In section 3 we continue our exploration with a more practice-ori-
ented focus. As the design literature describes, there are multiple ways
to understand ‘human- ‘or ‘user-centric’ design, but only some of the
methods and solutions created under these concepts are participatory
in the sense of letting users and other stakeholders have a say about the
design outcomes. In this section we discuss how the model of five critical
questions by Joseph Giacomin,13 the matrix of design by Elizabeth Sand-
ers and Pieter Stappers,14 and the participation ladder model by Frans
Geilfus15 can help legal designers frame their projects from the perspec-
tive of participation and decide how to incorporate a more participa-
tory approach to them, if desired. To demonstrate the potential of these
models, we use method and solution examples from three legal design
projects: the SMS tool created by the Eviction Prevention Learning Lab
at Stanford University in San Francisco, USA,16 the digital ‘Entutela’ tool
created by Labjusticia at the University of los Andes, Colombia,17 and the
Legal Service Design Toolkit created by Háptica legal design consultancy
in Colombia.18 Our exploration will be concluded in the fourth section
with a summary of our main findings, their possible uses in legal design
practice, and ideas for future research.

2. The Paradox of Participation in Legal Design

Just like any other everyday objects invented by humans, legal artifacts
have specific functions that satisfy human needs that no other artifact
satisfies in a similar way.19 In this paper we understand ‘legal artifacts’
in a broad sense as anything tangible or abstract that belongs to or is
closely connected to the legal system by its functions, and which make
law visible and something that can be experienced by its human users.
The problem, however, as addressed by the legal design movement, is
that legal artifacts are seldom designed to fit their actual purpose of
use, at least not from the perspective of their laymen users.20 Design as
a practice-oriented philosophy is interested in promoting the well-being
of people by satisfying their basic needs,21 but the common design of
legal artifacts often leaves these needs unsatisfied. Therefore, the ques-
tion of purpose is closely connected to the question of whom the design
solution is intended for and, therefore, whose needs, capabilities and
motivations should be considered when designing legal artifacts.22 The
artifact’s purpose also raises the question of how it should be designed
and by whom to optimize its functionality. When seeking to understand
the role of participation in legal design, it may therefore be helpful to
start with a few ontological questions: What is law really for? What are
legal artifacts really for?

2.1. Why Law Needs Participation

As understood in modern legal thinking, law as a human invented system
can have many functions, depending on which perspective this system is
viewed from. Law can be used to solve conflicts, to protect the vulnera-
ble, to satisfy human needs, to allocate resources, to provide services, to
enforce political ideas, or even to ensure a living for lawyers, to name a

few.23 These purposes can also manifest in different ways in the form of
legal artifacts. The legal artifacts that serve the purpose of conflict solv-
ing, for example, can be the procedural regulations that guide a litigation
process, the litigation documents, the litigation process happening at a
courthouse, the courthouse itself, and the final court ruling that seeks to
solve the conflict.24 From a purely legal point of view, it may also seem
logical that lawyers are the primary users of these artifacts, and there-
fore their needs should be considered when designing these objects.
However, as socio-legal theories help us understand, both the scope of
users and the purposes of use for legal artifacts are more diverse due to
the specific function that law has in society.

   If we accept the idea that law has a unique function in society, it fol-
lows that the artifacts that are part of that system also share the same
function. According to established legal and socio-legal theories, par-
ticularly the theory of social systems by late sociologist Niklas Luhmann,
the specific purpose of law is to guide human behavior by establishing
normative expectations.25 Normative expectations, communicated for
example in the form of legislation or court rulings, tell people how they
are supposed to (‘ought to’) behave to satisfy interests that society con-
siders worthy of protection, such as resolving conflicts or taking care of
the vulnerable. Normative expectations also tell us what kind of behav-
ior people are entitled to anticipate from others, thus helping people to
plan their future activities and prevent possible conflicts of interest.26
Only behaviors that meet the normative expectations set by the law can
enjoy legal protection. This is also the core requirement of legal cer-
tainty, the central element of the rule of law.27 From this viewpoint it
becomes clear that law and legal things are intended for all members
of society, or at least for everyone who needs to use them to access

the legal system and exercise their rights and obligations. As discussed
by Michael Doherty, the purpose of law in guiding human behavior can
therefore be seen as a justification for the application of human-centric
approaches to designing better functioning legal artifacts.28

  It is needless to say that guiding human behavior is a complex phe-
nomenon, perhaps too complex for just lawyers to take care of it. If
the purpose of legal artifacts is to communicate normative information
about what kind of behavior the legal system expects from its users,
ideally this communication and the way it is communicated should be
based on a non-biased, scientific and context-related understanding of
human behavior. This understanding can be acquired from various ex-
perts in behavioral and other human sciences, but also from the target
end-users and other stakeholders themselves. According to a behavioral
scientific theory called ‘the COM-B model’, there are three central com-
ponents, ‘capability,’ ‘opportunity,’ and ‘motivation,’ that are all needed
for any behavior to occur.29 For example, if a person needs to represent
herself at a court, to succeed in her task she needs the knowledge, skills,
and stamina (‘capability’), as well as time, money, and physical access to
the necessary materials (‘opportunity’) and enough interest to take such
action (‘motivation’) in order to succeed at the task.30 This information
about users’ capabilities, opportunities, and motivations can be consid-
ered subjective and context-related.31 Therefore, the best way to collect
it is from the target people whose behavior the design primarily seeks
to influence.32

  While participatory design methods can help gather the necessary in-
formation about the behaviors the legal artifact should support, they
may also have other benefits regarding guidance of behavior. Users of le-

gal artifacts are the best experts in their own matters. Involving users in
the legal design process as problem solvers and co-designers allows them
to pursue agency and autonomy, the right to decide for themselves.33
The democratic policy making process as well as the participatory de-
sign for policy movement are grounded in this very idea.34 According to
a behavioral scientific self-determination theory, the need for self-regu-
lation and control is also one of the fundamental human needs and core
factors for motivation.35 Legal artifacts that fail to support their users’
basic need for self-determination hardly bring out the best results. As
described by Margaret Hagan in the context of self-represented litigants
navigating inside the court system, if people experience that they have
no chance to influence their own case or they have only bad options
to choose from, they may become passive or reluctant to comply with
the given circumstances and eventually lose their ‘chances for taking the
full advantage of the legal system.’36 Participatory design methods that
engage users as the contributors to the design outcome can improve
users’ experience of ownership and agency in the design solution and,
therefore, give them a reason to comply with the behavioral models that
the design proposes.37

  User and stakeholder participation in legal design projects also enable
a learning curve for all participants, not just for the users, but also for
the lawyers, whose learning outcomes can eventually contribute to the
inner development of the legal system.38 This view is well adopted ia. in
socio-legal and legal realism research traditions,39 but also discussed in

modern legal theories, where lawyers are seen to have a dual role both
as the interpreters and the creators of the legal system.40 When engaging
with different viewpoints on legal matters through participatory prac-
tices, legal drafters themselves have the potential to learn something
new that benefits their legal thinking and lawyerly practices, and even-
tually the whole system.41 Learning is therefore a fundamental element
of positive change. As Buur and Matthews point out, ‘When presented
with an account of an exotic foreign mindset, we are compelled to view
our natural assumptions and practices in a new light’.42 If lawyers did
not encounter different, outsider viewpoints to law (and to life!), the
legal system would not receive the necessary information to reflect its
internal biases and to imagine, test and build better working legal con-
cepts and artifacts - for the sake of its own well-being.43 Human-centric
and participatory design methods can therefore work as practical tools
to gather and analyze legally relevant information for the internal use of
the legal system.

  Participatory methods also have the potential to gather knowledge of,
and make visible, the other different social systems and purposes that
influence the legal design solution. As noted in previous legal design
research, artifacts recognized inside the legal system as ‘legal artifacts’
can also have different uses outside the legal system.44 Contracts are
one example. If contracts are understood merely as ‘legal documents’,
it is natural to expect them to be written by lawyers using specific ‘le-
galese’ language and clauses that prepare parties for a possible legal
dispute.45 From a business perspective, however, contracts can be seen
as tools that,for example, help manage business commitments, create

and protect value, and realize financial benefits.46 If contracts were only
designed from the legal perspective, the other purposes might remain
unsatisfied. The difficult-to-understand legal text might even give rise to
misunderstandings and the neglect of one’s legal obligations,47 risking
the contractual relationship and its importance for the business. Par-
ticipatory approaches can help recognize the artifacts’ different uses in
different social environments and create solutions that make sense in all
of them.48

2.2. …and Why It is a Particular Challenge for Legal Design

The aims and philosophy behind participatory legal design are easy to
accept. In reality, however, based on our impressions and experiences as
legal designers in legal design projects, and as described in the legal de-
sign literature,49 putting the idea of participation into practice is trickier.
The ‘paradox of participation’ may not only be due to the legal culture
and the possible tensions that arise when it encounters the cultures of
other disciplines or professions.50 Successful communication and deci-
sion-making with other people, especially when there are many, who
all represent different backgrounds, knowledge and ideals, is a universal
human challenge – and sometimes a mission impossible.51 We all per-
ceive and interpret the world from our own unique inner perspective,
without the possibility of fully experiencing what it is to be ‘the other’.
The way we see the world and intuitively trust our own perceptions can
sometimes mislead us,52 making multi-level collaboration a task that re-
quires particular mindfulness, special methods and persistence in order
to succeed.

  Also, despite the popular interest that design thinking has gained dur-
ing recent years, the participatory methods and techniques of design are
not well known. If organizing multi-level co-work is a challenge as such, it
can be a bigger challenge when participants need to first be introduced
to the mindset, principles and methods of co-design. Although the de-
sign literature suggests that ‘design’ can be seen as a common language
or as a connecting factor between different disciplines and stakehold-
ers,53 in reality, if people do not understand this language, it can connect
them in a counterproductive way, such that it becomes the ‘common
enemy’. One reason for this could also be the way in which design as
a systemic and holistic approach challenges common thinking models.
The holistic and ‘free’ creative space that participatory design offers
may not be the environment where people feel comfortable to operate,
as it is not organized by similar mental frameworks, nor does it follow
the deterministic, linear logic that many classical professions are taught
to use.54 If participants do not recognize the way the design process
frames the problem solving, or how it can manage opposite viewpoints
and understandings and eventually help create something coherent and
sense-making out of them, they may experience the design process as
not at all organized, and lose interest in participating.55

  Then there are of course our all-time favorite excuses – time and mon-
ey.56 If doing a research interview or a stakeholder workshop adds the
expenses of a project, people with tight budgets and busy schedules like
to think that those things can be omitted and that by doing so they can
save time and money. The ability to communicate the fundamental role
of multi-level participation in a design process then becomes critical.

  The above-mentioned reasons are already enough to overwhelm a
legal designer who wants to successfully engage users and other stake-
holders in a legal design process. As we like to suggest in the following,
however, the concept of ‘legal’ and the different expectations and mean-
ings that lawyers and society in general associate with it can give partic-
ipatory legal design projects an extra twist. In our view that is because

the legal system and the traditional legal culture around it tend to foster
a rather narrow understanding of what a ‘legal’ problem is and when a
lawyer is needed to solve it. The multi-disciplinary and creative design
process rebels against this narrowness and challenges both lawyers and
others to think differently about law and the role of lawyers, causing
confusion about how to react to this challenge.

  From the perspective of the legal system only matters that have al-
ready been coded as ‘legal’ by the legal system itself – such as a question
of ownership, the right to compensation or the due process of litigation
– are proper ‘legal’ questions.57 Traditionally people have approached
lawyers with their legal matters when a problem has already actualized,
or is about to actualize, and a legal analysis is needed to solve the con-
flict between the parties and their interests. This human tendency to
react to problems only once they have occurred has created a culture
where reactive problem solving is normalized, and preventive or pro-
active problem solving is perceived as its ‘alternative’ (or abnormal).58
Against this traditional or reactive style of lawyering it is understandable
that some lawyers may find it irrational to ‘embrace a designer mindset’,
ideate and prototype with stakeholders in a joint co-creation process.
Solving legal problems from a pragmatic and ‘human-centric’ viewpoint
together with the users of the law differs significantly from the methods
that lawyers traditionally use, but also from what the society in general
has learned to expect from interaction with law and legal experts, as
well as from legal problem solving in general. Therefore, especially in
the beginning of a legal design project, there might be some confusion
about everyone’s role in the project, not just amongst the legal experts,
but also amongst the other participants.

  But what is the ‘legal’ work that lawyers are familiar with and what
do people expect them to do? Lawyers’ particular skill is legal interpre-
tation, that is, the ability to determine from various facts what is ‘legal’
and distinguish it from what is ‘illegal’ using information sources that
have authoritative value inside the legal system, such as legislation, case

law, or established legal principles.59 According to the above-described
Luhmannian socio-legal understanding, this is how normative expecta-
tions are created.60 Law school curricula, theories on legal analysis, and
the practice of jurisprudence have developed around mastering this skill
and the duty to the legal system that it involves.61 Luhmann calls this the
autopoiesis of the legal system, a self-regulation process that recreates
and maintains the system.62 Lawyers must follow the rules of legal anal-
ysis and interpretation, ‘the laws of the law,’ to maintain the coherence
and unity of the system and the trust it enjoys in society.63 In a legal de-
sign project, this knowledge is also crucial. However, it is applied from a
different point of view, or together with other different points of view,
and at a different moment on ‘a legal problem escalation axis’, often to
prevent legal problems or to promote ‘legal wellbeing’.64

  The unusual roles and setting of a legal design project and the way
it requires lawyers to practice their expertise beyond the traditional
borders of law may therefore explain why some lawyers feel confused
and unmotivated when invited to participate in design projects. Legal
design in its essence is not about solving acute legal conflicts or reacting
to a past event with legal consequences.65 Legal design, just like design
in general, operates in a space of many potentials, where things may
not yet be definitely ‘legal’ or ‘illegal’, but perhaps have the potential
to become such.66 When operating inside the legal system lawyers do
not have to deal with such open uncertainty and lack of structure when
solving problems, especially if they are called to action when an issue
has already become ‘legal’, as there often is a due legal process and rules
regarding how to proceed with it, and therefore, less alternatives regard-
ing how to deal with the issue.67 This moment is illustrated below in fig-
ure 1.

  As David Johnson points out, however, lawyers also know how to deal
with uncertainty, as they use their knowledge in a certainty-seeking
way.68 This supports the purpose of law, which is to create normative
expectations, in other words certainty, predictability and continuum in
society. The challenge for the legal design movement is to make lawyers
and anyone interested in improving the legal system understand that
design can offer effective tools for this purpose, but from a different per-
spective, at a different moment of time, in different spaces, and espe-
cially – as we like to highlight in this paper - with different people.

3. From Human-Centric to Participatory Legal Design

As discussed above, multi-level participation differs from what law as a
profession and a discipline has traditionally excelled in. It can thus be a
real practical dilemma for a designer or a design team to engage lawyers

in multidisciplinary co-work, facilitate it, and bring out satisfactory re-
sults. However, as the design literature shows, participation is a univer-
sal challenge in all design contexts, not just in law.69 To address this issue,
designers have developed alternative ways to understand and practice
stakeholder involvement.

  The participatory design approach, which emphasizes design with or
by users rather than designing for users, first emerged in Northern Europe
in the 1970s as a method to increase the value of industrial production.70
The participatory approach put together the expertise and knowledge of
designers and engineers and the situated expertise of the people whose
work was to be impacted by the design outcome. However, participatory
design shares the same philosophy of human-centered design (HCD), or
user-centered design (UCD), and the different approaches have recently
started to influence each other.71 They both focus on understanding the
needs of the people who use a solution or a design and propose that peo-
ple (as ‘humans’ or as ‘users’) should be involved in the design process.72
HCD and UCD have their origins in industrial engineering and computer
sciences.73 Donald Norman and Stephen Draper suggested in 1986 that
technology and design should be molded to the user’s capabilities and
needs and not the other way around.74 In his various works, Norman has
also emphasized designers’ need to understand human behavior and
the psychology that supports (or does not support) the functionality of
everyday things.75 Recently Norman has raised the idea of shifting the
design conversation from humans or users to humanity.76 This shift pro-
motes systemic changes that impact the societal level rather than the

     tered design and user-centered design.

individual level. It responds to the criticism of the HCD and UCD models,
that they have a narrow approach to people without considering individ-
uals’ relationship with social systems, regulations, or life itself. 77

  What the HCD and UCD approaches also put less focus on is the po-
tential of transformation, innovation and learning that participation in
the design process has.78 The enhancement of users’ skills and knowl-
edge is one of the distinctive elements that distinguishes participatory
design (or ‘innovation’) from the HCD and UCD approaches.79 As we
suggest in this paper, focusing on the quality of human-centric methods,
rather than just approaching law with a ‘human-centric’ or ‘user-centric’
mindset or ‘design thinking’, may be more useful for the purposes of law
and legal design.

  In the following we introduce three frameworks to implement partici-
patory design: 1) Giagomin’s five critical questions, 2) Sanders’ and Stap-
pers’ matrix of design, and 3) Geilfus’ ladder of participation, and explain
how they can help legal designers frame their project understanding
from the perspective of participation, and how to incorporate a more
participatory approach to them. We also demonstrate the frameworks
using the participatory methods applied in the creation of three legal
design solutions, as described in their published project reports:

  The Stanford Legal Design Lab’s Eviction Prevention Learning Lab used
an SMS strategy to help tenants get helpful information when facing
eviction. For the development of the system EPLL used different sessions
and interviews with legal aid experts, tenant advocacies and universities
to understand best practices regarding using text messages to empower
people in different stressed situations related to legal issues.83 SMS
messaging was used for three primary purposes: first, for outreach and
intake for eviction help and informing people about their legal status;
second, for ongoing engagement and participation of tenants by sending
reminders and updates; and third, for tracking outcomes by monitoring
tenants after they had received assistance.84

  ‘Entutela,’ developed by Labjusticia at the University of the Andes, Co-
lombia, is a digital tool that helps citizens draft and create a ‘tutela’, a
legal form for accessing fundamental rights in Colombia,85 without the
help of legal assistance. For the development of Entutela, explorations
were made with citizens, lawyers, law students and judges. In each in-
teraction with these users, the design team sought to validate the con-
ceptual and functional elements of the tool. Once the prototype had
been created and developed in an application to create forms, it was
launched live to understand its scope and impact. With the results of
this exploration, more than 100 tutelas were created in 4 months. The
second iteration round of the design process focused more on the tool’s
user experience, its interface (no longer on a form), and the way the
situations that make up the body of the tutela should be written. These
latter validations were only done with the users of the Legal Clinic of the
University of los Andes.

  The Legal Service Design Toolkit (LSDT) by Colombian legal design con-
sultancy Háptica is a compendium of tools and methodologies for de-

83 Verschoor (n 16).

85 The tutela is the primary mechanism for safeguarding fundamental rights in Co-

     lombia. It was introduced in the 1991 Political Constitution and was intended to
     be expeditious, informal and subsidiary. According to the Constitution, a citizen
     residing in Colombia can file tutelas without legal assistance and free of charge.
     However, most people who want to file a tutela need the help of a lawyer, which
     implies a charge for the drafting and filing. In addition, tutelas are a case of conges-
     tion in the judicial branch. Today, 30 years later, more than 9 million tutelas have
     been filed in Colombia, see Padilla Casas and de Francisco Vela (n 17).

veloping projects in the legal field. A designer, lawyer or innovator can
take this toolbox and use the cards that best suit their project. For the
development of the LSDT, Háptica used Beckman and Barry’s four phases
of innovation86 as a reference to define methodologies, tools or activities
that allowed them to investigate the projects they had developed.87 The
toolkit is divided into four phases: Discover, Interpret, Delimit, and Pro-
pose. For each phase, a series of activities comprise the organization’s
know-how.88

3.1. Five Critical Questions to Frame the Design Challenge

Based on our experiences as legal designers, when facilitating multidis-
ciplinary legal design work, it is necessary to pay attention to the legal
context and the language that is used to describe the context to differ-
ent stakeholders and make the roles that different stakeholders have
clear and visible. When the different components of a design challenge
are illustrated holistically as a starting point for the project, all of the
stakeholders can better understand their unique role and the value of
multi-level participation.89 Framing the design challenge from different
perspectives is especially useful to highlight how different stakeholders
are connected to the ‘legal’ problem, although they may understand it
differently.

  One way to do this visualization is to use Giacomin’s list of five critical
questions: ‘who,’ ‘what,’ ‘when,’ ‘how,’ and ‘why’ as its basis.90 The five
questions help identify the connections between the different activities
for a design strategy. In legal design, the model can help identify the de-
sired behaviors and the people whose behavior the legal design solution
should seek to influence and who should be involved in the legal design
process. We evaluated the three projects under Giacomin’s questions
to understand the connections between their design decisions and the

Exploring the Dimensions of Participation in Legal Design  271

legal designer’s desired outcomes (for a summary of the projects see
table 1).

  The first and most important question is ‘who’. It focuses on the peo-
ple or parties involved in the design process, especially the target users.
For example, in the EPLL’s SMS project, the target users were tenants
about to be evicted. In the Entutela case, the scope of the stakehold-
ers was broader, ranging from citizens to judges to lawyers and legal-aid
help providers.91 The target users of the Legal Service Design Toolkit
were Háptica’s clients, typically other lawyers.92

  ‘What’ describes the type of desired activities, behaviors and func-
tions that the design solution should support. In the case of the EPLL,
the desired outcome was to support tenants in making more informed
choices throughout an eviction process and empower them to take ac-
tion for their own cause. If a tenant does not respond to an eviction
notice, they are more likely to be evicted and face a more complicated
legal situation.93 In the Entutela case the ‘what’ is to help and educate
citizens to draft a proper tutela without legal assistance, but it is also
about giving them information about the legal system and how they can
navigate within it. Háptica’s toolkit aims at educating their clients about
design methodologies. When clients contract the design consultancy to
develop a legal services project, they must involve their organization’s
collaborators to understand and propose ideas. The toolbox helps them
as a means to integrate their vision with the employees’ experiences.

     Table 1. Giacomin’s critical questions applied to legal design solutions

  The ‘when’ is about the interaction’s form and timing.94 In the EPLL
project the understanding was that there are three critical phases when
the SMS system must provide guidance to tenants: before, during, and
after the eviction. The timing question is more challenging to frame in
the Entutela project, as there are many possible reasons, and therefore
times and places, to file a tutela. The Entutela solution that enables citi-
zens to make their tutela forms online using a digital platform solves the
problem of accessibility, at least for users who can access the internet.
The Háptica’s toolkit is intended to be used during legal design work-
shops with clients and stakeholders.95

  The question of ‘how’ refers to semiotics, communication, and design
discourse.96 The EPLL’s solution uses an SMS strategy to send information
that guides a tenant through an eviction process. SMS are also useful
for monitoring and tracking how the tenant’s legal process is proceed-
ing. The SMS’s also uses easy to comprehend language. Entutela uses a
digitally structured template that guides the user throughout the expe-
rience of drafting a tutela. The tool is divided into sections that are navi-
gable back and forth. Each section has easy-to-comprehend instructions
and guidelines to complete the information.97 The LSDT is composed of

Exploring the Dimensions of Participation in Legal Design  273

different activities according to the design phase. These activities have
descriptions and examples of how to use them. Also, the toolkit requires
a facilitator to provide guidance and respond to questions while partici-
pants use the tools.98

  The ‘why’ refers to the purpose of the design. In the context of legal
design, it is important to address the legal purpose of the artifact, while
acknowledging that artifacts can also have many other purposes that
can have value in creating a functionable outcome. Like in the example
cases, the purpose can be guiding tenants or Colombian citizens through
a legal process while informing them about their legal rights, so that they
can base their decisions on actual options that the legal system provides
them. The ‘why’ can also refer to an objective that supports other ob-
jectives, like training stakeholders to understand design methodologies,
so that they can start to implement them more independently and thus
socialize the legal design thinking and methodologies to their organiza-
tion and beyond.

3.2. The Matrix of Design to Understand your Approach to Users

Sanders and Stappers originally proposed ‘the landscapes of design,’ a
four-quadrant matrix, to identify new emerging design practices and un-
derstand the variations of human-centered design.99 According to Sand-
ers and Stappers, there are four different ways to categorize the prac-
tice of design: 1) research-led with an expert mindset, 2) research-led
with a participatory mindset, 3) design-led with a participatory mindset,
and 4) design-led with an expert mindset. Research-led refers to design
practices dedicated to understanding design contexts, either involving
(participatory mindset) or not involving (expert mindset) users. On the
other hand, design-led can be understood as design practices dedicated
to implementing solutions for (expert mindset or participatory mindset)
users.100 In legal design work, this matrix can help reflect whether the
approach taken in the project is ideal considering the project’s purpose
and the need to involve users in fulfilling that purpose. However, as the

98 Flechas, García and Escobar (n 18).
99 Sanders and Stappers (n 2) 2.
100 ibid.
274                    Nina Toivonen and Santiago de Francisco Vela

exercise below will show, not all legal design projects can be placed in
just one quadrant of the matrix; they can apply the different approaches
simultaneously. It is also useful to say that legal design projects can opt
for many different ways of approaching their users, and that applying
more of ‘an expert-mindset’ rather than a ‘participatory mindset’ may
not make their results less effective.

  The EPLL’s eviction project could be placed in the first quadrant of
Sanders and Stappers’ matrix (see figure 1), ‘research-led with an expert
mindset’. As described in the project report, the project involved sev-
eral consultations with different professionals who had expertise about
managing eviction cases, and for example about how to use SMS as an
intervention strategy, as well as the use of research data on typical pain
points in eviction procedures.101 Although it is not possible to evaluate all
of the details of the design methods used in the project based on avail-
able data, it seems that end-user understanding was created by using
more research-lead and expertise approaches than by engaging users as
actual co-creators in the project. The need to understand the impact of
SMS messages and the phases of the eviction process and their legal and
behavioral effects supports the approach taken.

  The approach taken in the Entutela project could be placed in the
second quadrant of the matrix, ‘research-led with a participatory mind-
set’, but between the ‘design-led’ and ‘research-mindset’ quadrants.
In the project it was necessary to understand profoundly the various
experiences of different users and create common language and com-
munication tools to reach that understanding. The project team used
different generative tools, such as low and high-resolution prototypes,
to dynamically understand and meet the needs of different stakehold-
ers.102 The project team also conducted several interview studies with

102 Padilla Casas and de Francisco Vela (n 17).
276  Nina Toivonen and Santiago de Francisco Vela

citizens to understand their experiences in drafting tutelas, as well as
with law students, lawyers, and judges to understand their perspective
in the process.103 Although the user groups had a possibility to influence
the design outcome, the design team made the necessary decisions to
guide and manage the design process.

  The case of Háptica differs from the two previously mentioned pro-
jects, because it itself is a tool to engage and activate different stake-
holders and groups to design for themselves. Therefore, it could be
placed within the quadrant in the corner, ‘design-led with a participatory
mindset’. It was designed by legal design experts to socialize legal ser-
vice design methods and understanding, and therefore not only aims at
improving people’s participation in projects but also provides them with
opportunities for learning and self-improvement. The toolkit could also
be categorized as generative design research.

3.3. Ladder of Participation to Choose your Methods

Geilfus’ ladder of participation identifies seven levels of participation
determined by the degree of decision-making that participants have in
the process (see table 2).104 The first two levels 1) passivity and 2) infor-
mation providing refer to low user involvement in the design process,
especially to the level of agency and decision-making they have in the
process. Users may be asked to participate for a certain period of the
process, or to fill in surveys or questionnaires, but they have no say in
how the information they have provided should be used.105 The next two
levels are 3) consultative participation, and 4) incentive-based participa-
tion. Design methods that consult users and hear their opinions to cre-
ate the outcome, yet do not give users the power to make that decision,
can be called consultative. EPLL’s design methods could be categorized
as consultative. EPLL developed a prototype for sending SMS messages
to inform people who are about to face eviction. After the implemen-
tation phase, workshops were organized to identify the good practices
of each actor involved. Virtuous cases were identified during these ses-

103 Padilla Casas and de Francisco Vela (n 17).

105 ibid.
Exploring the Dimensions of Participation in Legal Design       277

sions where SMS had had a more significant impact.106
  Incentive-based participation methods involve users or stakeholders

who supply labor or other resources in exchange for certain incentives. A
good example could be an organization that provides a test environment
for a prototype and does not get to directly decide how the prototype is
improved due to the testing, but as an exchange gets useful information
about the test to improve its own operations, or a possibility for learn-
ing.107

  The last three steps on the ladder are 5) functional participation, 6)
interactive participation, and 7) self-development. The methods mostly
used in the Entutela project could be defined as functional participation.

The project involved different stakeholder groups to meet pre-estab-
lished project objectives, but they had little to no role in the project de-
sign. For example, lawyers and law students were invited to experiment,
navigate and evaluate the prototype of the Entutela. Judges helped
identify the elements they considered essential for a tutela to be under-
stood, and once the online version was launched in collaboration with a
courthouse, the results were analyzed with the help of some of the users
who had sent their tutela through the system.109

  Háptica’s toolkit can be viewed as supporting interactive participation,
or even self-development. Interactive participation solutions help organ-
ize stakeholders to participate in project design, and its implementation
and evaluation. They also involve a systemic and structured teaching and
learning process, as well as a progressive transition toward control and
management by the stakeholders.110As in Háptica’s case, it is important
for a design agency to create their own tools and methods that support
the specific needs their clients have in design projects, so that they can
re-apply them if needed in future projects. To support this aim Háptica
has also launched its own legal design courses under the name Háptica
Academy, where people interested in mastering legal design methods
can train their skills using the toolkit.111 Both the toolkit and the courses
support stakeholders’ possibility to take their own initiative in legal de-
sign projects, without waiting for an external input from an expert. At
this level of participation the roles of the designer-experts and the users
have flipped: it is the expert that is being consulted, not the other way
around.

  What is noteworthy is that all of the example legal design cases rep-
resent a relatively high level of user and stakeholder engagement. This
may be due to the social and systemic nature of the design projects, as
well as the use of various design methods that as such require active
participation from stakeholders. This supports the view of legal design
as a genuinely participatory design approach.

Exploring the Dimensions of Participation in Legal Design  279

4. Discussion and Implications

Our exploration in this paper has shown that the central idea in legal
design, to make legal systems more human-centric and participatory, is
more multi-layered than the everyday discussion about legal design of-
ten implies. First of all, there are multiple ways to reason this approach.
The most important, and well acknowledged, reason is that the legal
system itself needs information from multiple perspectives to function
better. Different stakeholder groups and the end-users of the law can
help lawyers, legal scholars, government officials and other caretakers
of the legal system to reveal its internal biases and develop artifacts and
systems that are more in line with the purpose of law. One purpose of
the law, as understood in contemporary legal thinking, is to guide human
behavior by creating normative expectations. This behavioral aspect of
law also necessitates that the people whose lives are being influenced
by the results also get to take part in the knowledge formulation and
decision-making processes regarding the design, not just by providing
information, but also through having agency and validating the meaning
and acceptability of the result.

  There are also multiple reasons why participation is easier said than
done. Participation is a challenge in all design projects, and various au-
thors in the design literature have provided their understanding of the
phenomenon. However, in this paper we have focused on the special
features of the legal context that can make collaboration in design pro-
jects trickier. Law, both as a professional culture and as a method of
problem solving, tends to reject anything ‘non-legal’. It is easy to under-
stand that the legal system can only define, recreate and sustain itself
in society with its own communicational codes (‘legal’/’illegal’) and its
own communicators (lawyers, courts, legislation etc.) for the purposes
of legal certainty and rule of law. However, proper lawyering does not
only have to refer to reactive style problem-solving, working ‘with an
expert-mindset’, or solving problems alone using only legal facts and le-
gal information sources. If more lawyers, but also more people in gen-
eral, understood that aside from the traditional and somewhat exclusive
styles of lawyering there is space for human-centric, participatory and
creative problem solving, perhaps more people would feel welcomed to
280  Nina Toivonen and Santiago de Francisco Vela

be involved in it. As we have discussed above, both of these approaches
aim to fulfill the same purpose of legal certainty.

  The third dimension explored in this paper is the concept of ‘partici-
patory design’ itself. Although the concept has its origins in human-cen-
tric and user-centric design approaches, it goes beyond understanding
the user to providing them with decision-making power and experiences
of learning and innovation. The design literature reports several frame-
works and methods to plan and reflect the participatory approaches to
be taken. In this paper we introduced three of them. Giacomin’s five rhe-
torical questions can help break the design challenge into areas of ‘who’,
‘what’, ‘how’, ‘when’ and ‘why’, and answering them will show what di-
rection and level of participation might be needed to ensure working
results. Framing the project with these core questions at the beginning
of a workshop, for example, will also show the participants what infor-
mation and perspectives are needed from them, as well as from others.

  Once the desired scope of the project has been defined, legal design-
ers can use the Sanders’ and Stappers’ design matrix to reflect what type
of approach to users, as subjects (‘expert’) or as partners (‘participa-
tory’), and design tools, tools to understand (‘research’) or to implement
(‘design’), to take. This exercise can help legal designers understand their
own role in the project (a ‘designer-expert’ or a ‘facilitator’) and the pros
and cons of their approach and create awareness about which type of
tools and methods would support reaching the desired outcomes.

  The third framework, Geilfus’ ladder of participation, completes the
matrix exercise and can be used to choose concrete participatory meth-
ods. Each level on the ladder refers to a certain type of a method. In the
case of legal design it is useful to be aware that the higher the ladder, the
more the methods on it give agency to the users and other stakeholders.
For instance, if a legal design project has elements of research-led and
expert mindset approaches, we would recommend looking for ‘function-
ally participatory’ methods that create a collective understanding about
the topic, but also have elements that make users’ point of view visible
and give them a chance to analyze what the solution would mean for
them. In practice this could mean conducting interviews with experts
in the field, but also with users, for example using social cartographies
Exploring the Dimensions of Participation in Legal Design  281

as tools. 112 Social cartographies help multi-disciplinary teams create a
common understanding about the topic or challenge they need to solve
by formulating visual and tangible maps.

  The exploration journey taken in this paper was a brief one. More re-
search would be needed to better understand the elements and tensions
of participation in legal design, especially from practical perspectives.
The question of who should be allowed to design law and legal artifacts
is provocative which reveals how important it is to have an ongoing dis-
cussion about the topic. If legal design has a specific purpose in improv-
ing the legal system, it should be about inviting different disciplines and
users of the law to be part of legal design teams. This also calls for mind-
fulness about not fostering a too narrow understanding of ‘the legal’
when it comes to legal design. A brief look into the participants’ back-
grounds at legal design events, seminars, workshops and social media
discussion threads shows that the idea of applying design in the contexts
of law seems to attract and engage mostly other lawyers. Although it is
only natural for legal experts to be interested in topics related to their
own profession, it seems, however, that there is still a way to go for le-
gal design to be a truly multidisciplinary approach. If not mindfully ad-
dressed, there is a risk of legal design becoming a mere fragmentation
inside the legal system, not an approach that can connect people and
generate impact and change. It should therefore be the collective aim of
the legal design movement to create and promote alternative and easi-
er-to-access spaces for multi-level collaboration in legal contexts.

  There are many initiatives, projects, labs and working groups that are
leading by their example.113 More research would be needed to map
their goals, methods and insights on multi-disciplinary approaches to
law. One example can be found from Latin America. Labjusticia at the
University of Andes in Bogotá, Colombia, connects an interdisciplinary
team of designers, lawyers and engineers to approach real-life problems
of access to justice from a systemic design perspective.114

TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO ACCESS TO
JUSTICE

Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

Abstract
Access to justice is one of the most critical issues in law. The legal justice system
needs a transdisciplinary approach to ensure better access to justice. This article
presents a methodology that combines the principles of Legal Systems, Legal De-
sign, and Systemic Design to be applied to the context of access to justice. This
methodology has been developed through an undergraduate course for law, de-
sign, and engineering students at Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia.
It considers three primary contexts: legal, social, and users. We have developed
a methodological guide that starts with the definition of the regulatory frame-
work, then identifies users´ perspective, followed by the interaction between users
to build the social system. The conjunction of these three elements defines the
boundary and requirements of prototypes, which are iterated and validated with
potential users. The application of this iterative methodology has allowed students
to reframe the problem, present a robust diagnosis, and propose solutions to the
studied situation. In the end, we present one successful case of the application of
this methodology: the reduction of pro-bono cases that remain untaken by law-
yers.

1. Introduction

The legal justice system is complex. This complexity arises from the va-
riety of individual actors and public or private organisations, with their
interests and goals, that interact and intervene in it.1 From this perspec-
tive, situations and problems presented by the legal justice system fall
under the definition of complex problems. Complex problems do not
have a single solution; therefore, the approach to solving them must
be systemic. Thinking about the improvement of the administration of

1 Camilo Olaya and Juliana Gomez-Quintero, ‘Conceptualization of Social Systems:
     Actors First’ (Curran Associates Inc 2016).
288  Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

justice invites for a synergy between engineering, law, and design. This
combination of disciplines has made it possible to explore the social sys-
tems surrounding justice administration and design solutions that im-
prove its performance.

  To develop this idea, we will begin by exploring why access to justice
should be understood as a transdisciplinary activity. Within that trans-
disciplinary exploration, we will review the connections that design, law,
and engineering have and how that led us to think about the method-
ology we use. That methodology is based on Legal Design,2 Systemic
Design,3 and Legal Systems4 (See figure 1). These synergies result in the
Systemic Design of Justice (SDJ) proposal. However, for this methodol-
ogy to work within the educational and project field, it is essential to
define the transdisciplinary tools we develop and use at different project
moments such as understanding the challenge, designing solutions, and
challenge management.

  In the end, we present a successful case developed by students on the
course, using the methodology in question; and we put forward some
reflections on the future of these disciplines and the work with organisa-
tions that ensure access to justice.

2. Transdisciplinary Dimension to Justice

The “wicked problems” concept defined by Rittel5 perfectly describes
what is involved in working within the legal justice system. Justice sys-
tems, like most systems, are composed of people, which makes them
a social system. Specifically, in the justice system, the improvement

5 Rittel’s first definition of wicked problems was presented by C West Churchman,
     ‘Wicked Problems’ (1967) 14(4) Management Science B-141. In that definition, he
     posited that wicked problems were a “class of social system problems which are
     ill-formulated, where the information is confusing, where there are many clients
     and decision makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the
     whole system are thoroughly confusing.”
290  Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

challenges take time to be identified. In some cases, we talk about the
implementation of technology; in other cases, we talk about the im-
provement of administrative management. In essence, many possible
points of intervention can be attacked. However, for each intervention
point, there are multiple types of users whose motivations are not al-
ways aligned. We can have judges, who want to administer justice best,
and citizens who want their rights to be respected. However, in trying to
achieve both points, we encounter barriers (regulatory, informational,
access, etc.) that prevent designers from having a clear idea of what to
do. In an exercise between the Liquid Legal Institute and the School of
Design Thinking at the Hasso Plattner Institute, where a design exercise
was proposed to respond to the Common Legal Platform, Kohlmeier and
Santuber6 reflected on and reinforced the idea of “wicked problems” in
legal design.

  Designing for access to justice is a wicked problem, requiring the in-
tervention of different disciplines. This interaction of different disciplines
is known as cross-disciplinary. Within cross-disciplinarity, three dynam-
ics are recognised: multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisci-
plinary. According to Chew,7 multidisciplinarity provides independent
inputs from each intervening discipline without needing knowledge in-
tegration. Interdisciplinarity proposes an interaction between disciplines
where particular dynamics are shared, generating collective agreements.
Transdisciplinarity takes advantage of interdisciplinarity to investigate
complex issues, generating synergies that transcend the domain of a sin-
gle discipline. Chew also opened a debate on the operational challenges
of generating cross-disciplinary curricula, highlighting the need for more
alignment between disciplines, generating fewer synergies, and creating
more distance between disciplines.8

Systemic Design of Justice: Transdisciplinary Approach...  291

  Since the emergence of Design Thinking, design has evolved as a
cross-disciplinary practice. On the one hand, Buchanan9 broadened the
spectrum of design by proposing four areas in which the designer can
intervene. These areas involve the subjects of (1) communication, (2)
materialities, (3) services, and (4) complex systems. On the other hand,
Kimbell10 made an interesting distinction between design-as-practice
and design-in-practice. Design-as-practice speaks of a designer’s pro-
cesses and methodologies to develop a project.

  In contrast, Design-in-practice speaks of the multiple results or im-
plementations of these exercises, understood as tools, prototypes, and
proposals. Also, this evolution of the design discipline has led it to adopt
a transversal position. For example, design and medicine have given rise
to Medising;11 design and psychology to Positive Design;12 and design
and anthropology to Design Anthropology;13 and recently, design and
law have given origin to Legal Design.

2.1. Design + Law = Legal Design

For Brunschwig,14 Legal Design is as much about process (design-as-prac-
tice) as it is about the outcome (design-in-practices). She states that Legal
Design comprises four elements: processes, products, actors, and con-
texts, and that it can also have sub-areas such as graphic design, product
design, and service design, among others. Brunschwig’s vision implies
a transversality between design (and its areas) and law. Likewise, from
Stanford’s Legal Design Lab, Hagan15 defines Legal Design as applying Us-
er-Centred Design approaches, typical of Design Thinking, to the legal or

justice context. For Hagan, this has allowed the exploration of different
design dimensions, such as communication, product, services, spaces,
and policies, all under the scope of technology. Both Brunschwig and
Hagan recognise that Legal Design has wide application as a design prac-
tice and a response to different situations that arise in legal contexts.

  The rise of Legal Design has allowed more universities, research labs,
and law firms to adopt its visions, methodologies, and tools. More and
more courses, publications, and events bring together different profes-
sionals to build on Legal Design. Complementing Brunschwig’s vision,
Legal Design has begun to expand its boundaries to enrich itself with
Systems Thinking. Including Systems Thinking or Systems Theory in Legal
Design allows for approaching legal problems from a broader perspec-
tive, generating a framework of analysis that identifies critical elements
to develop solutions to legal problems.16 However, Design Thinking and
Systems Thinking also have a practice in common, Systemic Design.

2.2. Design Thinking + Systems Thinking = Systemic Design

Ryan17 has made a proposal that combines the holistic views of Systems
Thinking with the user-focused approaches of Design Thinking. In his vision
of Systemic Design, there are three levels: Mindset, Method, and Meth-
odology. These three levels interconnect, allowing systemic designers to
bring to the table the values, criteria, and practices (mindset) to apply
tools (method) in a process (methodology). With this idea, Systemic De-
sign is intended to approach highly complex contexts. However, to define
complexity, Jones18 defines principles to differentiate a systemic problem
from a traditional design problem. The principles are idealisation, wick-
edness, purpose, boundary framing, requisite variety, feedback coordina-
tion, ordering, generative emergence, continuous adaptation, and self-or-
ganising. It should be noted that when Jones talks about these differences,

     cal Insights from the Field (Ledizioni 2021).

he also references the four areas proposed by Buchanan.19
  Systemic Design is also on the rise. On the one hand, the Design Coun-

cil launched a methodology called Beyond Net Zero.20 This methodology
seeks to consolidate the visions of Design Thinking and Systems Think-
ing. On the other hand, in 2021, a group of researchers led by Van Ael,
Ryan, and Jones21 launched the Systemic Design toolkit. The methodol-
ogy addresses tools from systemic thinking, such as zoom out, and de-
sign thinking, such as zoom in. These tools alternate to give relevance
and perspective to this more comprehensive approach.

2.3. Engineering + Law = Legal Systems

It is common to think that the intersection between engineering and law
is in the design of technology for the administration of justice. In many
cases, it is a resource that uses engineering to solve problems in addition
to justice issues. However, this intersection goes beyond a specific prod-
uct. Howarth22 says that Law and Engineering are similar in answering
what engineers and lawyers do.

     The characterisation of lawyers that best fits what lawyers actually
     do is not hero, or statesman, or trickster, or hired gun – all of which
     in some way relate back to litigation – but engineer. Clients come to
     lawyers, as they come to engineers, with problems that they cannot
     solve themselves. The service both engineers and lawyers provide
     is the solving of those problems. But more than that, although both
     lawyers and engineers might solve clients’ problems merely by offe-
     ring advice and guidance, the central instrument for solving problems
     that both use is a device of some kind – usually a physical device in the
     case of engineers and a document in the case of lawyers, although, as
     we shall see, it is less the physical embodiment of a device that mat-
     ters as how it alters the system within which it operates.23

They are alike in their purpose of producing solutions to problems and in
considering the social implications of those solutions. The latter is rooted
in engineering practice, as engineers must constantly test and validate
their designs. To be more precise, this intersection stems from our un-
derstanding of legal systems as social systems. These are systems where
different actors and organisations, public and private, interact and pro-
duce justice (or injustice). Thus, the law is responsible for designing legal
instruments that solve access to justice problems. From engineering, it
is complemented with the analysis of how this legal solution could be
correctly inserted into that social system so that it produces the desired
results. Thus, legal innovation is complemented by a systemic vision of
its implementation in a complex system.

3. Design + Law + Engineering = Systemic Design of Justice

So far, we have discussed that merging two disciplines can broaden the
approach to a specific topic. For instance, engineering and law can op-
timise the processes of justice administration. Law and Design can im-
prove the experiences around legal services. Design and Engineering can
generate a more holistic vision of the contexts, from the human to the
systemic scale. In this article, we want to present a methodology that
combines the principles of Legal Systems, Legal Design, and Systemic De-
sign to be applied in the context of access to justice. We have been pro-
totyping, iterating, and evolving this methodology since 2019 through
an undergraduate course for students of the three disciplines: Design
for Justice Lab. This class is structured around challenge-based learning.
For the different versions of the course, we have looked for public or-
ganisations with challenges that can be addressed from the law, design,
and engineering perspectives. One of the biggest challenges has been
finding a balance between the contributions the disciplines can make.
After five versions, we have arrived at this methodology called Systemic
Design of Justice (SDJ). This transdisciplinary methodology is where the
three disciplines share knowledge and combine tools to develop pro-
jects considering the legal context, the social context, and the people
within the contexts (see figure 2).
Systemic Design of Justice: Transdisciplinary Approach...  295

          Fig. 2. Abstraction of the contexts of interest for design for justice

  The legal context addresses the regulatory framework. The social con-
text allows for representing the social system(s) bounded by the legal
context. Furthermore, the user perspective allows for identifying the
people and organisations that interact within the social context through
legal and non-legal artefacts. In the Design for Justice course, we have ap-
proached projects starting from the legal context and regulatory frame-
work. However, we envision that the model can be approached from any
point, as it has a cyclical property. In that order of ideas, we first address
the understanding of the current regulation or norm in which the project
will be developed, in other words, to define the regulatory framework.
This regulation delimits the legal restrictions and defines a contextual
framework for the project. This definition of the legal limits allows for
identifying the users, artefacts, and organisations that use these laws.
A process of observation and information gathering defines the identi-
fication of users. Identifying actors gives us the starting point to build a
social system model. This model identifies the decisions and interactions
296  Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

of the different actors playing different roles in the system; their interac-
tions produce feedback loops that determine the system’s performance.
With the social system, we identify system archetypes and leverage
points. These leverage points allow for modelling and the evaluation of
user and system proposals. Next, we begin an ideation process of proto-
typing. The process includes evaluating how the interventions affect the
system’s dynamics (feedback loops ans system’s structure) and which is
the best option based on these results. Finally, we validate whether the
proposed solution responds to the studied regulatory framework. If yes,
the proposal could be implemented; if not, it would be necessary to see
if there is an option to propose an adjustment of the regulatory frame-
work (see figure 3).

 Fig. 3. The Mobius strip inspires the SDJ. It aims to create a research loop so that
                 all the elements integrate smoothly into the projects.

  In the first step, lawyers translate the regulatory framework elements
so that designers and engineers can use them. In the second step, de-
signers are responsible for carrying out information-gathering activities
so that engineers and lawyers can conceptualise the social system. In
the third step, engineers are responsible for building the social system
model so that designers and lawyers can visualise the context. In the
fourth step, engineers and designers define points of intervention. In
the fifth step, designers and lawyers propose solutions to implement.
Furthermore, in the sixth step, lawyers and engineers validate the im-
pact of the solutions. We have begun to validate this tool through work
Systemic Design of Justice: Transdisciplinary Approach...  297

with students from the three disciplines and research projects for the
construction of new products and services for access to justice.

4. Tools for Transdisciplinary Solutions

To apply the methodology described previously, we use different types
of tools that we organise according to the project moment in which we
use them: understanding the challenge, designing solutions and chal-
lenge management. The first two moments occur in a consecutive way
and the third one is transversal throughout all of the process. Some tools
already exist and are commonly used in each discipline (disciplinary),
some are common across two disciplines (interdisciplinary), and we have
also created our tools that articulate elements from different disciplines
(transdisciplinary).

4.1. Tools for Understanding the Challenge

Understanding the challenge is where we aim to grasp its legal, social
and user context (as shown in figure 2). Most of the tools we use at this
stage are specific to each discipline and some are interdisciplinary.
–– Analysis of problem environment (interdisciplinary – design and engi-

  neering): As a first approximation to the problem, we invite students
  to develop a PESTEL analysis, which consists in identifying political,
  economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal aspects that
  are relevant to the challenge. This analysis allows students to see the
  challenge holistically and identify potential barriers and facilitators for
  its solution.
–– Regulatory framework (disciplinary – law): Students must identify the
  regulatory framework relevant to the challenge. This is an exercise in
  critical legal analysis where the gaps or barriers between what the law
  says and what happens in reality, are identified. Groups should refer
  to the relevant norms, identify the gap or barrier that prevents that
  rule from being effective, and identify regulatory facilitators that can
  be used to reduce the gaps identified. This tool mainly defines the
  legal aspects of the challenge; hence leadership from law students is
  expected.
298  Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

–– User perspective (disciplinary – design): We ask students to identify at
  least 20 different actors that interact with the challenge for which they
  must define: names, relevant characteristics, needs, motivations, and
  interests. We then ask them to organise them in a 2x2 matrix24 using
  their needs or motivations as exes. Finally, we ask them to describe
  profile personas25 26 according to the results of the 2x2 matrix analysis.
  This user analysis is an activity mainly led by design students.

–– Social system (interdisciplinary – design and engineering): As a final
  task for understanding the challenge, we ask students to build a sta-
  keholder map where they identify actors (individuals and organisa-
  tions), the roles they play, and the interactions they have;27 28 we have
  developed a guideline for building these types of maps. We also ask
  them to build a systemic model (Causal Loop Diagram - CLD) based
  on the decisions made by the stakeholders they have identified. This
  CLD must include all decisions relevant to the challenge and feedback
  loops that determine the problem.29 Building this type of model is
  taught in a previous course for industrial engineering students called
  “System Dynamics.” Industrial engineering students mainly lead this
  exercise.

4.2. Tools for Designing Solutions

Designing solutions consists of a process of devising, iterating and vali-
dating different proposals that arise from the understanding of the chal-
lenge and that can provide a solution to it. These tools are mainly disci-

plinary from design and engineering.
–– Systemic archetypes and leverage points (disciplinary – engineering):

  Systemic models are helpful to visualise the system as a whole and
  to explore potential places to intervene with a systemic perspective.
  Identifying systemic archetypes -30 31 enables the identification of fe-
  edback dynamics that can potentially be intervened to leverage the
  system’s performance.
–– Critical thinking (disciplinary - engineering): We encourage students
  to reflect on the ethical implications of their proposals. For this, we
  use the Critical Heuristics of Social Systems Design32-33 from which stu-
  dents must address questions about four sources: motivation, power,
  expertise, and legitimacy.
–– Creativity exercises (disciplinary - design): To encourage creativity, we
  carry out ideation exercises such as “the cat and the fridge,” “what
  if?”, “10x10”, “Brainwriting,” “WOW-POW-HOW Matrix.” These exerci-
  ses are intended to produce as many ideas as possible that allow stu-
  dents to think “outside the box” while producing innovative solutions
  to the challenge.
–– Prototyping (interdisciplinary – design and engineering): Once studen-
  ts have at least three options for solving the challenge, we ask them to
  select one and develop the idea further. We do not expect complete
  functional prototypes but ask them for at least mock-ups of how it
  would work.
–– Implementation manual (transdisciplinary – design, engineering, law):
  Once the prototyping is done, we ask students to develop an imple-
  mentation manual, where they justify their design, explain its functio-
  nalities, and also come up with a plan of how the organisation can
  implement the solution taking into account the system in which it will
  be embedded.

4.3. Tools for Challenge Management

The last group of tools is used transversally throughout the entire pro-
cess. These tools are mainly focused on project management and group
work.
–– Group work (interdisciplinary – design and engineering): Each group

  is composed of students from three different disciplines (law, design,
  and engineering); there is a need to encourage communication, te-
  amwork, and shared understanding. For this, we use the Marshmal-
  low challenge34 to break the ice among students who do not know
  each other. Each group has to build the highest tower with limited re-
  sources in 18 minutes and keep the marshmallow on top of the tower.
  While building the towers, groups use different strategies: have the
  most spaghetti tied and put it together in the shape of a tower, others
  use a trial and error strategy to start with low towers and ensure the
  marshmallow holds before building any further, and others use all
  available resources to raise the tower by any means necessary. We
  have found that this tool illustrates what is expected from students in
  the class: they have to deliver a design that accomplishes the objecti-
  ve and makes the best use of available resources. This exercise is also
  an opportunity to reflect on group leadership, the ability to listen to
  others, and the way they organise and delegate their tasks.
–– Project management (disciplinary – engineering): we have developed
  a methodological guide with different tools for effectively managing
  the challenge.35 36 The guide develops three stages of project man-
  agement: Planning, Execution, and Validation. For the Planning stage,
  the guide suggests activities and questions for defining the scope and
  objective, group roles and activities, and strategies for effective qual-

  ity management and risk management. For the Execution stage, the
  guide focuses on prototyping, iteration, and trial and error manage-
  ment recommendations. Finally, the Validation stage focuses on stake-
  holder management and project documentation.

5. Case Study: How to Increase the Selection of Legal Cases at the Pro-
Bono Foundation?

As mentioned, we have applied this methodology and tools in our un-
dergraduate course at Universidad de los Andes. Last year we had a case
with the ProBono Foundation, where we could track the results beyond
the course.

5.1. Challenge

The ProBono Foundation in Colombia is an organisation that offers free
legal advice to people who do not have the possibility of hiring a law-
yer. Their model connects people with a legal need with lawyers from
firms linked to the Foundation interested in dealing with the case. Of
all the cases that the Foundation receives, some “orphan cases” are not
selected by any lawyer. In particular, cases that have to do with Family
Law (divorces, inheritance, alimony, and child custody problems, among
others) are those with a lower lawyer selection rate. The Foundation had
noticed that in the past, the number of Family Law cases incoming had
increased. However, the number of these cases that any lawyer did not
select also increased. The Foundation wanted the number of cases of
Family Law that are not selected to decrease. Hence the challenge was:
how to sustainably reduce the number of Family Law cases that lawyers
do not select (see figure 4).
302  Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

 Fig. 4. Visualisation of the current scenario and the desired and feared scenario.

5.2. Understanding the Challenge

The team working on this project defined the legal context within the So-
cial Function of Law. In Colombia, ProBono work is not regulated. There-
fore, it is directly related to the social function of the legal profession and
the possibility for everyone to access the judicial system. This lack of reg-
ulation means that there are no incentives to carry out ProBono work.
The lack of incentives means that there are insufficient staff to meet the
legal needs of the population without legal representation. Within this
normative analysis, they found two valuable opportunities. The first was
to make clear the need for ProBono work to fulfil the social function of
the lawyer to promote the effective implementation of justice. The sec-
ond was related to the formative value that these cases could have and
thus connect the practice of the Foundation with the Legal Aid Clinics in
order to increase the possibility of accepting and receiving cases that are
left out.
Systemic Design of Justice: Transdisciplinary Approach...  303

  From the user perspective, the team conducted interviews with 16
people within the context of the ProBono Foundation. The result of the
interviews allowed them to construct a 2x2 matrix where the affinity of
the users with the selected cases (family area) and the number of cases
that the lawyers select were taken into account. By classifying the users,
they realised that most had little affinity with cases in the family area,
but many more took ProBono cases from other areas. This classification
allowed them to identify that family cases are not sought after by law-
yers who take ProBono cases due to their legal complexity. Attorneys
taking ProBono cases look for cases that are easy to resolve, with family
cases being among the most time and resource consuming.

  The matrix analysis also allowed them to construct four profiles rep-
resenting users in each quadrant. The first profile is a law student that
collaborates with the ProBono Foundation doing judicial oversight of
the processes. The second profile is a firm lawyer who handles differ-
ent cases and has a flexible schedule for meeting with clients. The third
profile is an independent lawyer who does consultancies for different
entities. The fourth profile is a full-time intern in a law firm whose role is
to support senior lawyers in handling their cases. These four profiles rep-
resent different ways in which lawyers and users interact with ProBono
cases and should be taken into account during the design process to
ensure that the solution considers their particular interests, i.e. consider
that law students can be of support for cases that firm lawyers take.

  The development of the social system model (CLD) led them to un-
derstand two moments of intervention within the system. The first was
related to the information provided by ProBono for the offer of cases
and the conversion indicators for case intake. Although the information
was widely disseminated, family cases were orphaned due to the need
for more timely information. The reinforcement loop involved modifying
the newsletter to detail case information and provide more understand-
ing of the cases. The second moment was related to the incentives to
take the cases. Somehow, since they do not exist, there is no way to
connect them with the productive indicators of the firms; hence, there
is no motivation to take cases.

  These understandings from the legal, user and social system perspec-
tive reframed the challenge in three main aspects: information, commu-
nication, and evaluation. In terms of information, the team identified the
304  Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

need to filter the information that the Foundation delivers to the differ-
ent users according to the interests of the firms. In relation to communi-
cation the team identified a need to communicate cases more effectively
so they would not be orphaned. And in regard to evaluation the team
identified a need to generate mechanisms to measure the satisfaction
and user experience of the lawyers after having accepted the case.

5.3. Designing Solutions

The proposed solutions were structured around the redesign of news-
letters (information and communication), the integration of an incentive
model (evaluation), and the creation of a support network. Newsletter,
graphic and content changes were proposed for the weekly newsletter
to provide complete information on the types of cases. The modifica-
tions give lawyers the necessary information to decide whether or not
they are interested in the case. The incentive system was devised as a
strategy to assign differential points to each case that law firms or attor-
neys can acquire by taking the case. In this way, it will avoid benefiting
the firms or lawyers that take the most cases during the year, but the
one that accumulates the most points; since the objective is to reduce
Family Law “orphan cases”, this type of cases were given more points to
incentive their selection. The legal assistance network proposed a free
service for firm and independent lawyers allied to the ProBono Founda-
tion called “ProAsistencia.” The network is built through alliances with
the legal aid clinics of the universities to help with the follow-up and
development of cases.

5.4. Implementation Results

Recently, the Foundation informed us that in 2022 case selection in-
creased substantially. This increment was due to a series of implemen-
tations they made after receiving the students´ proposal. Within the
aspects proposed by the students (information, communication, and
evaluation), the ProBono Foundation implemented a “direct assign-
ment” strategy where they modified the information content of their
newsletter. The modifications include: more detail on the case, the area
Systemic Design of Justice: Transdisciplinary Approach...  305

of the law, and the documents needed to start working on it. This strat-
egy has facilitated the understanding of the case by the firm or attorney
and is a more helpful definition for taking the case. Due to technical is-
sues, they have not yet made any graphic modifications.

  Regarding the incentive model, they implemented a strategy called
“Formula Pro,” a system of points awarded to the firms for their perfor-
mance in taking cases, closing them to satisfaction and customer service.
In addition, the formula has extra points and badges that are awarded
for taking cases in areas such as labour, family, and judicial representa-
tion. Furthermore, in terms of the legal assistance network, they created
a strategy called “Profe ProBono,” in which they have the assistance of
professors in the family area who offer advice to volunteer lawyers who
take cases in this area. This network is to reduce the fear among the net-
work of lawyers of taking cases that are outside their expertise.

6. Discussion and Conclusions

Future professionals need to be able to understand and propose alter-
natives for their disciplinary challenges, but also to articulate with oth-
er disciplines. This articulation is what Chew37 calls inter or transdisci-
plinary education. However, inter or transdisciplinarity has challenges,
mainly when disciplines are rooted in a different ethos. The main goal of
inter and transdisciplinarity is to use the best of each discipline to deliver
an intervention that creates value. This crossover of disciplines does not
mean that professionals should change their nature.

  In other words, if lawyers, designers, and engineers work together to
improve access to justice, designers must not become lawyers, lawyers,
engineers, or engineers designers. They have to be able to understand
their disciplinary strengths to create synergies. They need to potentialise
their practice and expand the disciplinary frontiers while acknowledging
their role in a transdisciplinary project.

  Since 2019, when Labjustica started, we have had this same transdis-
ciplinary concern. Labjusticia is a transdisciplinary proposal to prepare
lawyers, designers, and engineers to address access to justice issues.
However, beyond thinking of this space as a design, law, or engineering

37 Chew (n 4).
306  Santiago de Francisco Vela and Laura Guzmán-Abello

course, we think of it as a platform to visualise the future of these pro-
fessions. That is why we have reflected upon the strengths and weak-
nesses of transdisciplinary education. For example, projects that could
be solved by generating decrees of law would leave out the design or
engineering work. More importantly, it would make the power of com-
bining disciplines invisible. Likewise, if the result were the transforma-
tion of a document into a graphic piece, the contribution of engineering
and law would be reduced. The good news is that these three disciplines
have already managed to have interdisciplinary spaces between them.
Design and engineering have given way to Systemic Design; engineering
and law to Legal Engineering; and finally, law and design to Legal De-
sign. However, what happens when the three disciplines are combined?
Should one of the disciplines be given priority over the other two, or
should one seek to blur the disciplinary boundaries to implement solu-
tions that respond to the challenge rather than the disciplines? While
these questions may seem simple to resolve, they are not.

  Over the years, we have defined, reflected on, and redefined our ap-
proach. According to Chew, we have moved from interdisciplinary to
transdisciplinary, working on five pillars: real problems approach, us-
er-centredness, systemic thinking, empirical exploration, and disciplinary
synergy.38 One of the crucial elements of these pillars is respect for the
other disciplines. The leadership dynamics represent the respect that
the disciplines must have concerning the project phase. We presented
an evolved model that alternates between different practices while ex-
ploring particularities from each discipline. Legal practices frame the
social system, and the social system frames the actors involved. Legal
practices, or legal contexts as we call them, are related to the regulatory
framework, which sets the guidelines for people to behave. Social sys-
tems comprise the social context within the regulatory framework. The
perspective of actors, or users as we call them, is related to the people
and organisation within the social system. These actors have roles, in-

tentions, and motivations.39 In the legal context, law students or lawyers
lead to identify the regulatory constraints for people to behave. From
the user’s perspective, design students or designers lead on understand-
ing and discovering the motivations, interactions, and interests of those
actors, people, or organisations. In social contexts, engineering students
or industrial engineers lead on building the social system to understand
and identify possible opportunities for intervention.

  Despite all of this disciplinary reflection, we have encountered other
types of challenges related to transdisciplinarity, such as teamwork.
Transdisciplinary teamwork faces information asymmetry, disciplinary
jargon, differences in thinking processes, and types of deliverables. To
address these issues, we decided to use bonding activities before intro-
ducing any justice challenge. These previous activities taught us that cre-
ating a smaller challenge would allow students to learn how their peers
behave while developing a project, so now, we dedicate three weeks to
team bonding before entering into any transdisciplinary approach. We
have used the Marshmallow Challenge because it helps to set the expec-
tations of what these students will face in a larger project. Another chal-
lenge is the relationship with organisations. We have tried different ways
in which organisations have the tools to draft their challenges. However,
we still need to ensure that these challenges contemplate topics that can
be addressed from all disciplines. In the end, we have to set up multiple
meetings with the organisations to refine the scope of the projects. For
example, if the scope is too narrow, students will only have the chance
to explore some of the contexts. Also, they will need help to alternate
leadership among the project. If the scope is too broad, students will not
have the time to narrow it down or will be lost most of the time. For fu-
ture methodology developments, we will improve the relationship with
organisations.

LEGAL DESIGN(ING) AND THE ONTOLOGICAL
TURN

Joaquin Santuber and Pablo Hermansen

Abstract
Designing for posthuman legalities explores ways of projecting new human-na-
ture-technology relations within the frame of legal rights. We do so, addressing
the problematic notions of human, nature, and technologies – all three of which
are hallmarks of modernity. In times of a global climate crisis and accelerated digi-
talisation, the legal system needs to shift the human-centred paradigm to consider
other ontologies that account for our posthuman condition. Problematising the
current human-centred design practices, this paper explores other ways of design-
ing beyond the Anthropocentric worldview. This demands a reworking, on both the
epistemic and ontological levels —ways of knowing and ways of being— of the de-
sign part as much as the legal part. Against this context, we explore the designing
of the rights of nature and the rights of machines. We elaborate five propositions
regarding ways of designing for the posthuman in the realm of law and justice. The
propositions are 1) prototyping as a way of disclosing worlds, 2) posthuman legal-
ities as trans-ontological liminality, 3) from explanations to describing, perform-
ing, and becoming, 4) posthuman solicitations, affectivity, and attunement, and 5)
posthuman co-incidences, resonances, and frictions. At the end of each one of the
propositions we share experiences from our projects on designing for the posthu-
man. The propositions are not meant to be a checklist, but to provide possibilities
for action to the reader. Thus, fellow researchers and practitioners will find in this
paper a rich conceptual reference, as well as strategies to explore and disclose oth-
er worlds. It will also serve as an invitation and encouragement to delve into the
complexities of the emergent posthuman legalities.

1. Introduction

The challenges the world is facing in the 21st century pose tough ques-
tions for our modern concepts and disciplines, yet the tools we have
312  Joaquin Santuber and Pablo Hermansen

can only provide weak answers.1 The big issues of today, digitalisation,2
climate change, and recently having to live with a virus, are forcing us
to question how we coexist in this world.3 In this regard, posthuman ap-
proaches have addressed this by placing the focus not on discrete enti-
ties, but on their relationship with other beings. This approach intends
to shift the centre from the human, overcoming human-nature and hu-
man-machine dualities, by conceiving of them as relational ontologies.
Yet, the law still has a one-world world paradigm, focusing on the regu-
lation of purely human action, i.e., human action on the environment.4
The posthuman stream of research has called for a legal ontological turn
to place the sphere of action of the law beyond the human to deal with
environmental issues.5 In a similar direction, a proposal for a cosmolegal
approach aims to account for the agency of other-than-human in the
current challenges, and the consideration of them in law-making pro-
cesses.6 The need to rethink the human-nature relation has also been
addressed from the way in which environmental law is designed with
an emphasis on socio-ecological resilience.7 In this chapter, we address
Designing for Posthuman Legalities in the context of climate change and
digitalisation, the two most pressing issues of our times.

  Despite the grandiose narrative around these anthropocentric issues
i.e., climate change and artificial intelligence, the micro-dynamics that
constitute them touch our daily lives. Wildfires burning large extensions
of woodlands and displacing non-human animals and human population
are becoming commonplace—even if it takes so little to forget about
them. Moreover, heavy rainfall leading to flooding and landslides has
led to towns and neighbourhoods being buried. And paradoxically, year
after year we are confronted with historical droughts that risk traditional
means of agricultural food production, extending the agony of rural vil-
lages. While a human-centric body of legal literature has created con-
cepts such as the force majeure to deal with such situations, it does not
address the need for a reciprocally respectful and sustainable relation,
in which humans and more-than-human beings have mutual rights and
obligations.

  In the context of the digitalisation of private and public spaces, the
story is no different. The digital knows no boundaries and captures every
aspect of our social life, exercising novel forms of control.8 Our work,
social, family, and sexual relationships are increasingly mediated by dig-
ital technology, and thus coordinated and regulated by it. Many of the
constitutive activities of our lives such as teaching –at both schools and
universities– are now carried out in private spaces, digital spaces owned
by big tech companies, which are replacing public spaces. This is also the
case for public services, including courts of justice, which are increas-
ingly moving to platforms and interfaces, in which the references of our
social organising are replaced by shiny buttons, dropdown boxes, and
clicks9.

  Recent design research has problematised the limitations of hu-
man-centred approaches in relation to digital technologies and smart
cities.10 This criticism has extended to placing humans and users at the
centre of design to solve the planetary challenges of our time.11 The alter-

native to that shortcoming of human-centredness in the social sciences
and philosophy has been framed under the posthuman discourse and ap-
proaches.12 In the field of designing, the ontological turn(ing) to the post-
human has been positioned as a reaction to the Anthropocene,13 as the
terminal phase of capitalist modernity.14 This has also been fostered by
the idea of designing for a pluriverse, in which many worlds are possible.15
The use of the verb designing over the noun design is especially relevant
in the context of posthuman ontologies and legalities. Design as an ob-
ject or noun suggests a fixed structure that is adapted to be applied in
a particular case. On the contrary, by focusing on designing, we relieve
the performative dimension, we open ourselves to intra-action, and
we question the hegemony of the word as a strategy for categorising,
predicting, and regulating relationships. Design is a properly humanis-
tic-modern-Western discipline, while designing is a doing —a political
action— whose performative dimension allows us to apprehend16 oth-
er-than-humans, re-know-us and trans-form-us into/with other ontolo-
gies17.

  In line with previous work in design research, addressing the post-
human is to overcome human-centeredness and embrace the social
and material complexity of a model in crisis, projecting more “respon-

sible, accountable, and ethical ways of engaging with emerging tech-
nologies”.18 From this we frame our contribution as foregrounding the
human-nature-machines legal entanglements. We do this by exploring
posthuman legalities, within the frame of rights of nature and machines.

  Recently, legal design has emerged as an interdisciplinary practice, at
the intersection of law and justice, and design.19 Despite its brief history,
its foundations in human-centred design have been questioned, urging
for an “expanded practice of inquiry”.20 Answering that call, legal design
has also been addressed from critical design perspectives,21 speculative
design,22 radical imagination,23 cosmopolitical design,24 and designing
with theories via diffraction.25 In doing so, together with fellow research-
ers, we have taken a critical—yet affirmative—stance on the injustices
and inequalities meditated by the law and its design.

  In this paper, we build on that communal effort and offer theoretical
and practical insights into a posthuman approach to legal design. This ap-
proach places the emphasis on the human-machines and human-nature
ontologies and their possible novel forms of co-existence. After a brief
literature overview on designing and the posthuman legalities— within
the frame of the rights of natures and rights of machines— we elaborate
on five propositions for the practice and research. These propositions
are: 1) prototyping as a way of disclosing worlds, 2) posthuman legali-
ties as trans-ontological liminality, 3) from explanations to description,
from description to performing different worlds, 4) posthuman solicita-
tions and embodied attunement, and 5) posthuman co-incidences, reso-
nances, and frictions. For each of these we provide short accounts of our
own experiences of doing design research on interspecies relations and
digital logic in courts of justice.

2. Related Work

While the topic of posthuman designing and legalities is novel, there
is already a basis of literature stemming from critical design and legal
theory. In the following pages, we cover part of it to provide a frame
and justify the need for Legal Design to embrace an ontological turn into
posthuman legalities.

  Posthuman Designing and the Problem with Human-Centred Design

     it is often ethically appropriate and morally important to do design
     that does not align with the status quo of governing, or for that mat-
     ter, with industry. It is a responsibility of academic designers to ask
     questions and pursue lines of thinking and doing that are at odds with
     our standard forms of government and governmentality and that are
     at odds with free-market ideologies.26

  We take this call to action as our opening statement. Designing outside
the dominant canon, the logic of industrial production and the endless
pursuit of efficiency, cost reduction, and profit seems an impossible en-

     tice (MIT Press 2022) 9.

deavour. Trying to do so questions the very core of our modern condition
of humans. Our social life is shaped —after all— by the same rules and
values as the production chains in a factory, from education to labour.
And while it is hard to imagine the end of the capitalist system,27 we see
hope in contemporary critical understanding of design as a posthuman
practice.28 In this regard, design’s sources and beneficiaries exceed the
all-mighty consumer of products and services. Design accomplishes its
goals by orchestrating and serving a myriad of actors ranging from other
ways of being people, to other living species, bacteria, and technolo-
gies.29

  However, while a refreshed perspective on design is welcomed, we
need to be wary of the long-term commitments of design to industrial
production, relentless innovation and novelty and the universality of its
application, which can render contemporary forms of imperialism, and
design-powered authority and dominion.30

  This phenomenon, described by design researcher DiSalvo, is even
more true for human-centred design due to its large adoption in industry
and the public sector. This has turned the human into a marketable be-
ing, often referred to as the user. Where traditionally there was a citizen,
now there is a user. Where there was a voter, now there is a user. The
modern condition of being human is inextricably compounded with that
of being a user — a homo usus: to be is to use. Thus, placing a market
type of human at the centre for the design activity justifies the reproduc-
tion of systems by placing the spark or inspiration for new products and
services in the human-user-consumer.

  In the field of law and justice, and in politics and democracy the un-
questioned adoption of human-centred design approaches is even more
problematic. The adoption of such practices in policy and legal design has
served as a trojan horse to impose market values over those of democ-

racy, justice, and equality. The alliance between design and the market,
via human centred design, has surpassed its dominant influence in the
private sector and industry and has been embraced with determination
and enthusiasm in government, public offices and civil society.31 This can
be seen as another manifestation of the citizen-consumer paradigm.32
Similarly, critical voices have raised the concern that access to justice
projects has been captured by logics of globalisation and neo-liberalism
since it is instrumental to the global market’s operation and the safe-
guarding of foreign investment.33

  The popular statement from design theorists that now everybody de-
signs34 is inscribed in the notion that design recreates and reproduces
elements of the systems we live in –industrialised production, mass
consumption, and a global system of labour. On this, Design Thinking, a
methodology which popularised human-centred design in corporate set-
tings, has been characterised as part of a strategy in which consultancy
firms have ensured that Anglo European design remains at the “apex of
global hierarchies of labour and creativity”,35 in a global context of manu-
facturing power that is being taken over by China and India. This strategy
is easy to spot on any of the digital hardware coming from Silicon Valley,
as they proudly announce on the back of Apple products: Designed in
California. Assembled in China. When competition on expertise with the
raising Chinese and Indian economies was no longer possible, Design
Thinking helped western corporate leaders to move from expertise to
empathy and mysticism, entitling themselves as the only ones capable of
translating the needs of humanity.36 By doing that, Design Thinking and

human centred design have helped corporations to perpetuate the epis-
temic injustice around creativity and inventiveness that is intertwined
with technological progress dependencies between the North and the
South.

  Summarising the three problems with human-centred design:
1. Placing the human as the source of needs, and only a certain human

   as the creative one
2. The human as the only recipient of the benefits of design
3. Homologising the human and the user, turning the human into a mar-

   ket-consumer entity

  However, there is hope. Placing ourselves in the realm of legal design
comes with the deep belief in, and commitment to, the notion that
the legal system is a valid and powerful vehicle for social transforma-
tion and change.37 Specifically, legal design practice is bounded to the
betterment of the rule of law, access to justice, and ultimately social
peace.38 That is valid, even acknowledging that the way it is currently
done serves the interests of a dominant way of being and knowing and
excludes others.39 However, this acknowledgement should not lead to
surrender and hopelessness; instead it should lead to a revitalised ap-
proach to our legal systems and the drive to change from within40, even
if that means dismantling part of it. In this direction, in the context of
designing for law and justice, it is important to first acknowledge the

role of law in creating systems of subordination and reworking them
from within towards liberatory expressions of the law as a joint effort
of radical transformation.41 It is, however, necessary to overcome the
anthropocentric limitations of the law and designing a legal system for
a more-than-human world.

3. Posthuman Legalities: the Rights of Nature

As a major source of structure and coordination of our social life, law and
the design of legal systems project a defined worldview and leave others
out.42 In relation to nature, the worldview and commitments represented
by the legal system are in-line with those of production-based progress,
massive extraction of earthly goods, and infinite consume-powered
growth.43 This projected worldview of the anthropocentric legalities—or
the regulation and coordination of a unique anthropocentric world—
could be otherwise. Such an alternative has been conceptualised in legal
scholarship as an expression of a lifeway, in the context of indigenous
legalities and an “earth-centric ‘rooted’ form of constitutionalism”.44
This represents an alternative to the dominant western constitutional
tradition because it is not the same practice with a different object (i.e.,
nature); instead it represents a whole novel form of doing constitutional
law, which represents a lifeway, a way of being in the world.

  In the human-nature ontology, the field of environmental law plays a
significant role. Based on previous research, law should move from ac-
counting for human action as harmful to the environment to a mutually
enhancing relationship, conceived of as posthuman legalities.45 In the
study “Towards an EU Charter of the Fundamental Rights of Nature”,
evidence and recommendations are provided for the implementation of

the rights of nature at the legislative and policy level in the EU.46 This
study emphasises the

     need to reframe rights from adversarial to synergistic, moving us from
     “rights” to “right relationship”, a “right relationship” being one that
     supports the wellbeing of the whole47

  From a constitutional perspective on environmental issues, the Con-
stitutions of Bolivia and Ecuador consider Nature a subject of rights. In
the same direction, the rejected constitutional project in Chile granted
rights to nature.

  To conceive the Rights of Nature, we argue that an ontological turn is
necessary. The reason is that the mobilising capacity of our current legal
instruments towards a regenerative human-nature relation are limited
by the condition that our current legal paradigm is at the root of the
degenerative practices of production, enabling and protecting them.48
This is at odds with nature’s generative power, as in the case of plants,
which turn into life everything that they touch, because plants make the
world.49 A challenge for western legal systems is the one-world world
paradigm.50 The one-world reference builds on a critical account of
mononaturalism and multiculturality, which states that there is just one
way of being and knowing, while differences can be explained simply as
cultural differences.51 In contrast, the invitation is to design for/from a
pluriverse52 or fractiverse,53 in which many worlds fit in the world. This is
also what legal pluralism has fostered, be it intended or unintended 54.

  An important case of posthuman legal issues has to do with inter-
species justice and non-human consent.55 Moreover, the notion of the
consent of other-than-humans has also been addressed by design re-
search, as an exploration of ways in which stones and trees say no.56
Far from being a pretentious account of trees and stones in biology and
geology, it seeks local stories in which posthuman legalities are made
explicit and visible. Those new materialisations of legal concepts, rights
and duties in our legal systems need to be designed, prototyped, and
implemented. The role of design in (pre)figuring those relationships has
been addressed as designing and prototyping a cosmopolitical practice,
a doing.57 In this, through design intervention, the team of designers
propitiated inter-species’ encounters with animals in a Chilean Zoo.58.

  The issue with the current legal system’s paradigm is its intrinsic hu-
man centredness—if not exclusivity. In this regard, the exclusivity we re-
fer to is not only human activity as the only source of law-making and
regulating, but that the human is its unique beneficiary, and thus it has
a self-imposed constraint to remain in the realm of the Anthropos.59 Put
differently, under this logic, nature or the environment is worth protect-
ing because it provides a value to the human, and not because it has
a value on its own. The design practices that deal with posthuman le-
galities should be wary of reproducing such a problematic tradition. An

issue that arises from engaging with other ontologies is the lack of com-
munication mechanisms of such beings in a written or oral human lan-
guage. In legal theory, the role of Nature’s guardian has been proposed,
as someone or a group that speaks for the trees; yet alternatives have
been proposed in the direction of eco-feedback, as a form of expression
of the fundamental right of free speech of nature to prevent acts that
silence nature’s voice.60

  However, engaging with posthuman legalities demands an ontological
shift, overcoming human pride and opening the space for other ways of
being and relations, beyond the human. In this regard, a reconsideration
of the legal ontology implies that…

     animals and plants, then, as well as robots, should have rights not be-
     cause they are like humans, but because of what they are.61

  Thus, when designing for posthuman legalities, it is crucial to resist
the temptation to humanise things and to ascribe them qualities that
were thought and refined to fit the human way (more specifically west-
ern-European) of being in the world. We should not attempt to ascribe
intention and free will to posthuman legalities. Instead, this is an oppor-
tunity to rethink our role in the world, moving the human from the driv-
er’s seat to the role of a passenger who finds itself in a world and tries
to make sense of it. Reformulating our set-in-stone legal building blocks
is important to prevent us from transposing human hierarchies and ine-
qualities that our societies have failed to solve to posthuman relations,
amplifying existing inter-species inequalities.62

4. Posthuman Legalities: the Rights of Machines

While machines and even very sophisticated digital technology are not
considered to have human capabilities, media equation research has

shown how people treat technology like real people and places, in a
comparable way to how people relate to other people.63 This research
emphasises the idea that in our intuitive conduct of everyday practices
the distinctions between us and them are blurry, and the human-ma-
chine gap vanishes at times (or has never really been there).

  Already in the 1980s, researchers in the foresight studies division of
the Hawaii Judiciary speculated about 21st century robots having legal
rights and duties.64 Already, 20 years into the new century such a futur-
istic scenario has not entirely become true. Nevertheless, a world with
increasing agency of technologies and nature (often (mis)understood in
the form of natural disasters) sets a path to rethink the relation, and the
responsibilities that one and the other have. In this regard,

     the expansion of rights to robots may promote a new appreciation of
     the interrelated rights and responsibilities of humans, machines and
     nature. With such a holistic extension of rights to all things in nature,
     from animals and trees to oceans, comes a renewed sense of respon-
     sibility, obligation and respect for all things. 65

  While some argue that HCD approaches should play a vital role in the
design of AI,66 the need for an expanded practice of inquiry is necessary.
The complexity of human-digital relations is posing new challenges to the
capacity of law to regulate and coordinate our social life.67 Moreover, the
waves of digitalisation of our daily practices, digital infrastructure, are
displacing traditional forms of regulation and coordination, in a phenom-
enon characterised as the digital undertow.68 This challenges the human

hierarchy of the regulator and coordinator, and places digital technolo-
gies as both the regulated and regulators. In this direction, technologies
constitute a competing regulative regime that rivals traditional legal and
policy instruments.69 As such, we are no longer —or perhaps we never
have been—in the position to regulate digital technologies. The question
is not whether certain technology (think of AI) needs to be regulated, it
has always been regulated. The real question here is by whom it is be-
ing regulated, and whether we humans are regulating or being regulated
by technology. Taking a posthuman approach situates us within the hu-
man-machine entanglement; thus this regulation is no longer an inter-
action, but rather an intra-action. In this scenario, the human-machine
relation also needs to be understood as a posthuman legality.

  Moreover, machines and their digital programming operate in a logic
of omnipresence, in which every aspect of social and material life can be
captured in the form of data.70 This logic has been further characterised
into two goals: capturing the world and its realities in bites and datapoints
(digital omniscience), and the control of social and organisational life via
information technologies and systems.71 Thus, digital technologies are
not just a means to perform a task but are pervasive and ubiquitous in
our lives. Even if they become invisible (we cannot see algorithms), they
have politics that click by click, scroll by scroll are invisibly enacted in
our societies.72 In this regard, in designing technological infrastructures,
engineers, developers, and designers project their norms, values and
worldviews,73 and have the capacity to shape behaviour on a large scale

by means of their codes and software.74 In the design of digital technol-
ogies, theories about the world are embedded in their infrastructures
and are thus adopted through their use, performing the world.75 The
modern illusion of the machine subjugated to the human starts to fade,
and we observe all around configurations of human-machine ensembles
in which the boundaries are hard to point at. These hybrid bodies made
up of human-machine configurations have been the subject of Science
and Technology Studies as hybrid ontologies in the form of cyborgs.76
This is not a matter only of corporations and private life but has reached
the very court of our legal institutions.

  Previous research in the digitalisation of courts has called to account
more-than-human agencies in the design of courts’ e-Proceedings,77 and
more recently the effect of AI in transforming the relation between hu-
mans and technologies in courts of justice 78. The materiality of the legal
and justice systems has always been there – the bench, the coat of arms,
and the columns.79 That materiality is now being replaced, augmented
and transformed by algorithms and their interfaces. It is an invisible ma-
teriality, but yet so material, so political. These hybrid ontologies have
also been considered under the rubric of technolegalities i.e., in DNA
profiling in criminal justice and forensics.80

  As such, law and justice can leverage the current developments in de-
sign, philosophy and the social sciences to account for more than human
agencies and capture new forms of coexistence. An example of that is

our relation to things and their right to be repaired. In a recent publica-
tion, the “more-than-human-right to repair” is presented as a design op-
portunity to rethink the relation with things and artificial intelligence.81
Starting from a legal change, introduced by the right-to-repair in a brief-
ing in the European Parliament,82 there has been a shift in the focus on
purely human needs to the relations of humans and our everyday things,
such as a toaster and all the unremarkable and small smart things around
us (Internet of Things).83

5. Ontological Clashes in Public Space: The Case of Climate Activism
and the Case Techno-Judicial Entanglements

To highlight the relevance of taking an ontological turn in Legal Design
practice and research, we ground our methodological proposal in two
cases of ontological clashes in public spaces: climate non-violent activ-
ism by the German group Letzte Generation, and their practices of glu-
ing their bodies to public spaces. The second case is the digitalisation
of Chilean courts, especially the hosting of judicial hearings online via
Zoom.84

regulations, or media influence. This idealisation of public space omits
or naturalises the different norms that these spaces materialise and im-
pose on the bodies that move and unfold there.85 The regulations that
make up public spaces become especially evident when citizen groups
demonstrate in streets, squares, and parks to publicly make visible what
they consider to be situations or unjust power relations. Since 2011,
the massive mobilisations and demonstrations of social discontent that
have developed in various parts of the world have once again put on the
scene the political and citizen character of public space. 86

  One of the constituent elements of any citizen manifestation in the
public space is that, to make visible what is claimed, those who demon-
strate performatively overflow the configuration, the programme, the
daily uses and the materialities of the space where they manifest them-
selves. As a space of appearance and encounter or to question the power
relations that constitute the polis,87 those who protest occupy the public
space aiming to be seen through actions that allow them to make visible
their contested bodies, slogans, and demands. This visibility dialogues
creatively with multiple counterparts. At the same time, it constitutes
an adversary while affirming as a collective those who demonstrate; it
calls for the definition of others with respect to what is claimed while
temporarily displacing the usual practices of the place where it is per-
formed.88 As seen in Images 1 and 2, the activists appear with their faces,
posing for the camera to capture their actions (see Image 1b). In short,
by overflowing the configuration, the programme, the daily uses and the

materialities of public spaces, its normativity and the power relations
that we exercise daily when making normal use of it become evident. In
the antipodes of the Habermasian idea, we observe that it is performa-
tive frictions – not discussion and rational deliberation in pursuit of the
common good – that evidence the political character of public spaces,
opening the possibility of reflection and critical action.89

  For example, as we can see in images 1a, 1b and 2, the narrative ten-
sion of the scene emerges from the contrast between the protesters and
their background – the museum as an institution and the street as a
normative infrastructure. Those who protested at the museum (image
2) challenged the sacredness of Art and the radical indifference of insti-
tutionalised culture regarding the urgent problems that the protesters
claimed, stressing the republican imaginary, government architecture
and cultural symbols of power. The possibility of demonstrating is lim-
ited by time, spatial and material conventions: the bars and the security
personnel define the space that can be occupied, and that which cannot.
The transgressive character of those who protest is that, through their
staging, they overflow and appropriate the infrastructures of power, cul-
tural symbols and limits of political action – certainly for a limited time,
as we see in image 3, but that lasts through the publication of its photo-
graphic record.

  Their performances are at odds with the historicist republican imagi-

terpieces and, in general, its symbolical power. The set, efficiently made,
creates a perfect contrast against the materiality of the museum. In turn,
the protesters’ use of their equipment and clothing demands a dexterity
that is difficult to improvise. So, we can affirm that the scene is not the
product of an outburst, but of careful planning. And in turn it demands
dexterity from the police forces to clear the area without harming the
bodies of the protesters glued to the pavement (image 3).

  Those who register (image 1b) are simultaneously protesters and
communicators. The mass media have lost the monopoly over the publi-
cation of images: it is increasingly common for individuals, social move-
ments and citizens in general to generate and disseminate their own
photographs and videos.90 The images they produce while demonstrat-
ing circulate both in their intimate sphere and in their social networks
and independent media, collapsing the usual separation between those
who demonstrate and the mass media, and challenging the monopoly
that they have historically held. In the case of the climate activist group
Letzte Generation, they have a gallery with all of their images on their
website and a cloud-stored Google Drive folder that is open to every
person who would like to use the images.91 Moreover, this dual role am-
plifies its relevance since the image can circulate in real time.92

  In this way, streets, squares and parks are public spaces to demonstrate
off and online through the visual registration of demonstrators and their
practices, which usually operate with full awareness of social actors, who
are increasingly conscious of this visual dimension and make strategic
use of it. Moreover, streets as a space for demonstration acquire political
status and the potential for transformation if what is happening on the
street is being socialised via the press or cotemporary social media plat-
forms and the internet.93 The activity of sharing becomes a constitutive

action of the political movement.94 The staging of those who manifest
themselves supposes a visuality capable of being registered and dissem-
inated, in order to transmit messages, but also generate affections and
interpellations.95 Beyond its capacity for dissemination, this dynamic of
the registration and publication of political manifestations in the public
space performatively configures many of the visibility actions that these
same demonstrators-communicators develop, since they are deployed
in dialogue with the visual register and to enhance the memorability of
this once it is published. The way in which bodies express themselves in
public spaces is intricately connected to the communication and tech-
nological tools -devices- they utilise to convey information about the
events occurring in the streets.96

5.2. Technologies in Public Spaces

Dialoguing with the Habermasian idea of public space, the court can be
described as the place where a rational discussion and deliberation takes
place, inscribed in the constitution and laws, and conducted by a group
of experts in doing justice, to resolve differences between private parties
whose conflicts exceed in intensity or complexity what they can resolve
directly and spontaneously.

  Following the Habermasian ideal, for this mediation to occur with-
out the interference of other powers of the State, the market, or the
influence of the media, the staging of judicial procedure – with its order
and hierarchy – is considered a constitutive dimension of the exercise of
justice. This is especially relevant given the public access to the judicial
process. Consequently, in its staging, the court incorporates a section
of public space into its structure, but a highly regulated one. The court
scene and the area for the public are clearly and materially separated
by a bar or rail. In the same way that in government buildings i.e., the
Presidential Palace or Congress, metal barriers and police personnel are
arranged to contain the citizen overflow within the executive power, in-
side the room a half-height wall —known as the bar— with a door in

its centre materialises the separation between the public space and the
judiciary. In Chilean criminal courtrooms the litigator scene is divided
into two sectors, the bench and the lower stage (for the litigators), and
together it must have a size (52 m2), equipment and invariable distribu-
tion, which are organised to ritualise the roles, positions and flows of
those who lead the process. On the contrary, the size of the spectator
public area within the room is relative. When considered necessary, two
capacities are suggested: for 32 people (30 mts 2) and for 16 (16 mts2).
The bench and litigator area are materially distinguished. The floor of
the judge’s bench is 32 centimetres higher than the rest of the room and
the three judges who are located there face the rest of the participants,
sitting in a closed front with wooden panels. Wood, especially in courts
where modern materials such as concrete prevail, symbolically inscribes
the judges in the institutional tradition, suggesting that their authority
takes root and continues the history of this power.

  The two sectors have differentiated access, but while the judicial scene
has six access points – four for officials and two for security personnel
– the public have only one entrance door to their sector, which is con-
trolled by a security officer who is subject to a strict protocol. The distri-
bution of judicial officials at the scene clearly shows their inscription in
the institutional hierarchy, while their location and equipment facilitate
their agency and manifest their role. For its part, the spectator or public
area is designed for those who occupy it to perform as non-participating
observers. While the bleachers for the public only facilitate sitting and
witnessing the judicial action (passive scrutiny), the equipment of the
judge’s bench and the litigation area is designed for experts to deploy
their work devices and develop their tasks, such as taking notes or con-
sulting documents. They do justice.

5.3. Zoomification of the Judicial Scene

The restrictions on movement imposed in the pandemic forced the ad-
ministration of justice to take place within private spaces, more precisely
within the digital sphere. This imposed on the judicial scene a new con-
figuration, programming, modes of use and materialities. The courtroom,
with the bench, the litigation area and spectators or public space were
reduced to a latent image, to the memory of those who inhabited it.
Designing for Posthuman Legalities  335

  What justice is emerging with the irruption of the digital sphere?
  The algorithm behind the Zoom platform allocates the position of each
participant in its own unknown and obscure logic. However, it provides
each participant the same space in terms of pixels. This sense of horizon-
tality in the relation happening in the digital courtroom breaks with the
highly normative –century old model—distribution of the judges, par-
ties, and audience in the courts. The hierarchy is flattened by the screen,
without the depth of a shared space that provides the architecture of
the courtroom. Moreover, the homogeneity forced by the software
make invisible references to the identities of the participants. We cannot
tell who the judges are, or the offender, or the victim. Furthermore, their
role is limited to delivering information, as a vehicle constituting them as
commodities in the process of delivering justice. The documentation, re-
cord, profiling, and storage of portraits of the participants is given by the
videoconferencing platform possibilities. These profiling mechanisms,
however, are outside of public scrutiny and critique by civil actors, com-
munities and other public institutions because they are behind a wall
of secrecy, which is justified in the property of the algorithm. This is an
issue of the privatisation of public space and processes, in which the
traditional agencies of regulation and coordination of the processes are
replaced by human and more-than-human techno-power. These novel
forms of techno-power are internal actors, however with different logics
and values, as well as external actors that are inscribed in the digital
sphere, which exceeds the self-imposed limits imposed by the judiciary
to preserve its independence.
  We use the expression digital sphere instead of digital technologies
to highlight the scope, complexity, and particularity of the globalised
maraña that constitutes the digital networks of information, interaction,
and communication.97 Given the field we are dealing with, it is especially
important to distinguish the already mentioned digital sphere from the
public sphere, the environment that confers legitimacy on the judiciary.
It is dangerous not to problematise the fact that justice being a consti-
tutive part of the public sphere, the digital platforms on which justice

rested during the pandemic are private collective spaces, over which the
State has a discreet influence. The private infrastructures for the exer-
cise of justice tend to be at odds with the materialities, practices, pos-
tulates, and principles that have made the law and justice. This makes
it problematic to suggest without criticism that, for example, these plat-
forms improve access to justice, since they could tend to change what
justice is.

  The digital sphere, as a private infrastructure for collective life, works
mainly on privacy regulations designed to guarantee the profit of its
owners. Consequently, when used for exercising citizenship, they often
come into conflict with national laws and public interests. At the same
time, the increase in discretionary solutions with which members of the
judiciary face the adaptation of their practices to the new digital plat-
forms also increases the influence that the logic of the digital sphere has
on the practice of justice. When acting tactically, each official reproduces
a way of doing things that they have naturalised in their everyday expe-
rience of social networks, which constitutes a hotspot or access door for
the logic of the digital sphere. The point is that besides the spontaneous
individual agency underlies the logic of social networks, opening a new
flank for the irruption of their influence.

  In turn, responding to the tireless search for surplus value with which
their owners overcome the hectic flows of capital, these regulations and
their “terms of use” evolve at a frenetic pace, which contrasts with the
slow pace with which the laws respond to social changes. Due to the
already mentioned differences –in materiality, power relations, goals,
principles, adaptability, etc.– the places that make up the digital sphere
–Zoom, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc.– are ontologically different
from those of the public sphere –squares, courtrooms, streets, parlia-
ment, etc. In other words, the distance between these private digital
places of collective meeting and the halls of the justice buildings is greater
than the difference between a public square and a shopping mall.

  While the public is supposed to be a collective space for a dialogue
regarding the common where private interests and the power relations
that regulate our coexistence in private environments are put on hold,
the digital sphere privatises the common, and organises the collective in
business spaces where the exercise of what is public must be submitted
Designing for Posthuman Legalities  337

to the extraction of surplus value. In each sphere, citizenship means rad-
ically different things.

6. Methodological Propositions for Designing for Posthuman Legalities

Due to its early development and its fundamentally exploratory spirit, we
present in the following section five propositions for the practice of, and
research into designing for posthuman legalities. This propositions, as they
stand, are better understood as lines on a sketch, projections of something
that is becoming a gestalt. They are also to be thought of as steppingstones
from which to delve into the posthuman legalities. The propositions are:
1) prototyping as a way of disclosing worlds, 2) posthuman legalities as
trans-ontological liminality, 3) from explanations to describing, perform-
ing, and becoming, 4) posthuman solicitation, affectivity, and attunement,
and 5) posthuman co-incidences, resonances, and frictions.

6.1. Prototyping as a Way of Disclosing Worlds

Designing for posthuman legalities demands a radically different ap-
proach to the scenarios we are designing. In this context prototyping
is never an end-result, or as in human-centred design a tool to validate
assumptions regarding user needs. In contrast to prototypes aimed
at matching an actual need or desirability, prototyping posthuman le-
galities aims at revealing a world that is hidden. This is different from
speculating about a possible future through prototyping;98 this is about
disclosing a present that already exists, yet is invisible to us— episte-
mologically and ontologically. In other words, by prototyping we do not
bring to the present a future or aim at predicting it;99 instead we unearth
and shed light on something that is already here - we disclose an aspect
of the world that our ways of knowing and creating knowledge have pre-
vented us from seeing.

     Dreaming (MIT Press 2013).

     tural and Critical Epistemologies’ (1990) 22 Futures 115.

  In this way, the embodied process of building or sketching a proto-
type, together with the gestures and stories that are part of it, serves as
a scaffold to the unfolding scenarios we are designing.100 The emphasis
in prototyping is on practices, ways of doing, which in turn open up ways
of being in a world (in contrast to results). Processes and practices can
be found in an account of experiencing a line, in which the line is not the
connection between two points, but rather is the embodied experience
of the pen’s friction against a sheet of paper.101 A line is in the multiple
experiences of “walking, weaving, observing, storytelling, singing, draw-
ing and writing” a line.102 It is the process of becoming a line, not the
line as an output, a result, a number. Similarly, in an exploration of the
interstice of posthuman ontologies, free from human-centred epistemic
constraints, practices can be enacted in “walking, flowing, listening, dif-
ferentiating, processing salt, reading, photosynthesising, thinking, floc-
culating, writing, infecting, revising, or filter-feeding”.103

  This is particularly relevant in working with plants, since in plants do-
ing and being are inextricably entangled.104 The way plants are in the
world is by making the world because plants do not have other worlds to
escape to. In this regard, beyond the human ways of creating by means
of our hands, plants are a great example of shaping the world like no
other actor, yet they do not have hands.105 Likewise, from the famous
“for the trees have no tongue” by The Lorax, trees do not need trans-
lators nor representatives that speak up for them; they are expressive
in their own ways, just not our human centred ways. The way in which
different worlds are disclosed is far from being a well-defined process or
objective; they look more like tales of something that happens.

  During my research on the digitalisation of courts, I set up a research
apparatus to collect data on the social media activity of the Chilean

courts.106 To perform the data collection I registered my personal account
to use the API of social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twit-
ter, and Instagram. The moment of revelation came when I was in bed,
before falling asleep on social media scrolling past photos of friends, and
suddenly I found myself engaging with the content of Chilean court tri-
als. That situation disclosed a set of relations in which --without actively
consenting-- I was part of the judiciary’s communication machinery by
consuming their content, liking posts, sharing and reposting, all from my
bedroom thousands of kilometres away from Chile. The entanglement
of courts’ activity and social media algorithms became a substantial part
of my doctoral work and a departure point for posthuman legalities.

  In the work on cosmopolitical prototyping, the doing poses questions
about the status that would otherwise not be asked. Prototyping in this
sense questions and dis-locates without having the answers and does
not even aim at them. By prototyping a form of more-than-human re-
lationship, the very conditions of that relationship and the entities that
participate in it are tested, revealed, and become.107 As we discussed,
it is a challenge for the law to incorporate prototyping and its vocation
of failure or failure as a speculative or test form for the construction of
legal bodies for relationships that exceed the scope of the word. Proto-
typing allows us to test the relationship conditions for which we have no
empirical background to predetermine a norm, such as the relationships
between ecosystems and algorithms, such as the release of water from
a reservoir or dam by an algorithm.

6.2. Posthuman Legalities as Trans-Ontological Liminality

The approach to posthuman legalities is always trans-ontological.108 The
designer cannot grasp another ontology without leaving the boundaries
of its own worldview. This transit between ontologies and the indeter-
minacy of the process can be better characterised using liminal theory.

  At the beginning of the 20th century, the book Rites of Passage pointed
out the hallmark transitions and their rituals in different communities,
across time and space, that are performed to ease the passage from
one state to another, childhood-adulthood, life-death, and marriage.109
The stage of liminality was then further explored, the liminal phase, the
“betwixt and between” state.110 From their original application in small-
scale societies and groups, liminality has also been studied in more ex-
tensive contexts.111The recent COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis
we are in have been characterised as a form of global liminality.112 In the
context of digitalised judicial practices, liminality has been used to make
sense of the governance (or the lack of it) of digital technologies in pub-
lic services.113

  Across contexts and scales, a key element for liminality is suspended
normativity, in a transitional and transformative space with blurred
boundaries.114 Designing from a trans-ontological place lifts the century
old legal structures and concepts and opens a space to re-imagine fun-
damental positions, and by imagining them we become them. This pro-
cess is characterised by blurring boundaries, distinctions and positions,
and even the suspension of societal values and principles.115 Moreover,
liminal processes bring opportunities as well as risks to modern organi-
sations, cultures, and societies.116 On one side, liminality creates a tem-
porary space for generativity, disruption and creativity,117 while on the

other, the capacity of liminality to become permanent generates constant
uncertainty and disintegration.118 Designing for posthuman legalities is
not about solving the trans-ontological paradoxes (as a human-centred
solution fixed approach would aim for) but working the liminal condition
through. We should not attempt to define this trans-ontological, as we
should not fruitlessly try to explain it, but we can start by moving our
practices from describing to performing posthuman legalities.

  In the project in the Chilean courts, conducting design research on
non-human agency, the liminality came from many sides. Trying to ac-
count for digital, physical, legal, judicial, institutional, and individual
agency, at times it felt like the language was missing, or falling short. At
times it felt like the methodology needed many hacks and walks around.
Regarding the data, while interviews served as the steppingstone, soon I
realised it was a very human account of things, and I needed to go back
to disclose the non-human doings in the courts. I then reconstructed a
genealogy of the practice by putting little parts of a trans-ontological
mosaic of data points. It was, nevertheless, fascinating and rewarding.

6.3. From Explanations to Describing, Performing, and Becoming

While there is a temptation to stay in the realm of what has been ex-
plained by our fellow natural scientists, in these interstices, liminal places
in which posthuman legalities enfold the demand for scientific certain-
ty may lead to stagnation. Even worse, seeking explanations will put us
back on track towards reproducing the inequalities that science has cre-
ated. Breaking from the scientific exclusivity allows us to transit to other
places and put them in a trans-ontological dialogue. Latour’s approach
put forward descriptions as a more satisfactory approach to social phe-
nomena than explanations.119 However, as designers and researchers we
are not outside the world we are observing, because observing a world
is at the same time producing that world. In the engagement with post-

342  Joaquin Santuber and Pablo Hermansen

human legalities, when designing we are already performing those on-
tologies differently.

  Non-human are a substantial part of the world making process. From
the perspectives of plants and nature “to be in the world necessarily
means to make world: every activity of living beings is an act of design
upon the living flesh of the world”.120 In these practices of becoming in
relation to other-more-than-human ontologies, a key element is the
search for a meaningful and reciprocally value laden relationship. In
performing this ontology the invitation is to embrace values beyond the
exclusive benefit and centrality of the human, co-constituting these re-
lations in a process that is “more like filter-feeding”.121 Humans, in this
sense, do not play a central role in such a performance but are part of a
thick mesh of relations of humans and more than humans 122.

  From a methodological perspective, designing is understood as the
performance of the people, media and tools we work with.123 Put other-
wise, designing is already a performance of things, tools, and the people
they work with. Performing different ontologies implies a rearticulation
of objects, behaviours, and narratives to adhere to the rules and prin-
ciples of a world. In this relation, it is not clear who is using whom, the
tools the people, or the people the tools. 124 Performing those ontolo-
gies, we need to do differently. The differentiation capacity of practices
as world making follows from the notion that “different realities are en-
acted in different practices”.125

  In the project on courts digitalisation in Chile my goal was never to
explain what was happening; rather, we transited from looking for and
then drafting stories about what I was seeing in the emerging digitalised
practices in courts. After a long time dealing with the phenomena, we
could not but acknowledge that we too were part of it. We spent hours
and hours watching, scrolling down, attending virtual hearings, and talk-

ing to court personnel. We were playing our part; we were performing
with others - human and non-human - in the digital courts in Chile.

6.4. Posthuman Solicitations, Affectivity, and Attunement

Our design practices, as mentioned above with prototyping, are our
ways of, and vehicles to disclosing different worlds. For that an open-
ness to that world is required. Here the concept of solicitations is useful.
Solicitations are situated experiences in which an agent feels the inclina-
tion to act in a certain way; it is the/a world calling to act on it.126 This are
a certain type of affordances that stand out as relevant to the situated
individual, in a landscape rich with affordances as our modern life is.127
This is not just a possibility for action, but to be drawn by the particular-
ities of a situation, called to act upon a matter.128

  In designing for posthuman legalities, as being and existing in a
trans-ontological liminality, we adopt strategies, or leverage from arte-
facts, behaviours and narratives to be open to solicitations. This is a form
of disposition to be moved, to be touched by something and with that
gain a glimpse of the trans-ontological liminality. To be part of it, design-
ers need to develop a sensibility to the regularities of the environment,
the ability to be affectively open to these encounters – to affect and be
affected by something as in Spinoza’s affectus.129 Moreover, on Spinoza’s
affection it is about, an “encounter between the affected body and a sec-

ond, affecting, body”.130 The reference to bodies is, in its broadest sense,
human and more-than-human, i.e., a body-without-organs. The capacity
to affect and to be affected is tightly connected to the ability to solicit
and to be solicited by something.

  A solicitation, as affection, is not a thought, an emotion, or a decision,
it is being part of a constant flux, an attunement with the regularities of
different worlds. It is us responding to the movement of the waves in the
sea, as the Oysters loyally respond to the proposals of the tidal rhythms
in the mangroves.131 When our anthropocentric ways of communicat-
ing fail, the door to other worlds is to return to the attunement of the
vibrant matter.132 Moreover, things do not affect us because some phi-
losophers granted them some sort of human agency, but because they
are part, as much as we are, of the dynamic flow and currents of the
lifeworld.133 While this is usually invisible to our way of knowing, it is a
matter of a bodily attunement of our sensing bodies to the currents of
that other lifeworld.

  While studying the digitalisation of courts’ practices, we had the
chance to interview a lawyer working with victims of sexual abuse and
rape. Inquiring about the tensions of interviewing victims via videocon-
ference, he reflected on the importance of “breathing the same air” dur-
ing an interview face-to-face - sharing the same space and connecting
through the invisible medium of air that surrounded and permeated the
lawyer and victim. In remote interviews, the shared breaths were miss-
ing, and so was the ability to generate trust.

  In the project on Interspecies Encounters at the Chilean Zoo,134 the
team of designers was engaged with Judy and Gombe while they were
playing with a rope. Suddenly, one of the chimpanzees took away the
rope from the other. In that moment, she turned around and asked one
of the designers to solicit something to restore the rope. The perception

of such a subtle change in the currents of the play by the designers was
a way of the chimpanzee acting on him, revealing that all the time he
was observing their play, he was being part of it already. It was not that
the chimpanzees invited him, but that through bodily participation the
designers were already performing that world, even if he was not yet
aware of it.

6.5. Posthuman Co-Incidences, Resonances, and Frictions

By decentring the human from the world, attunement is not a matter of
will and intentions but of concurrence. Thus, in posthuman legalities we
seek co-incidences, resonances and frictions as modes of trans-ontolog-
ical affectivity.

  Co-incidences have to do with a shared world making, and a shared
becoming. We co-make the world and thus we co-exist in it, and our fate
is bounded to that of nature and machines. Even if we are not all the
same, “we are all in this together”.135 By co-incidences we emphasise
the posthuman notion of having a shared incidence in the world’s des-
tiny. With the capacity to influence the situation comes at the same time
the responsibility of humans and non-humans to create a caring world.
Caring is understood as providing the conditions for the possibility of
other relationships to emerge, in a way that new forms of being in the
world are fostered.136 In the case of plants’ immersion, action is not nec-
essarily bounded to consciousness, but to compenetrating posthuman
ontologies.137 Paying attention to posthuman co-incidences is the human
taking a humble position and accepting that far from being at the centre
of creation, we have come late to a world already in the making, which
exceeds our generativity in space and time.138 Life on earth was there
before humans, and will last beyond our existence, we are just playing
our part.

  Posthuman resonances resemble the physical phenomenon of an
increased amplitude of a wave or frequency. In the trans-ontological
affection, resonances are amplifications resulting from the alignment
between worlds, their rules and values. Differently, frictions relate to the
resistance of the motion of other surfaces. This is two worlds that are
in conflict, or worlds that do not touch each other, that do not overlap.
Resonances and frictions are part of a trans-ontological coexistence.139
The inspiration for resonances as a category comes from the project
“Tectonic Resonances” presented by Chile in the London Design Bien-
nale 2021.140 One of the authors (Hermansen) was part of the curator
team of that project.141 In this project, resonances were used to refer to
the natural sound of stones extracted from the Chilean Andes. By fore-
grounding the voice of the stones regarding the impact of extractivism
and highly techno-mediated life, the installation reactivated the poten-
tial for more-than-human forces in dealing with the current issues of the
Anthropocene.142

  The notion of friction has been worked in design, with an optimistic
connotation, in which frictions, as tensions, conflicts and disagreement
move the design inquiry forward, arising as possibilities, turnings, and
dead-ends demanding to be worked through via prototyping.143

natural and technological entities would be between subjects of law.
Taking a design research stance, such a body of law covering these rela-
tionships must be prototyped, not drafted a priori. Such explorations via
designing and prototyping reveal new questions that we cannot formu-
late without digging into those posthuman ways of being. Speculating
in this direction, the nature-human-technology trio leaves out a consti-
tutive ontology of Latin America: non-corporeal or spiritual beings. For
example, Mapuche144 cosmology considers that nature, humans, tech-
nologies, and spirits (deities, ancestors, earth beings, etc.) live on a con-
tinuum. In other words, spiritual entities are not transcendent (like the
Christian God) but immanent (a la Spinosa). If they are immanent, they
live with us and their existence depends on certain material conditions
(e.g., earth beings), could they become subjects of law?

  In this sense, facing the current challenges with the old habits and ref-
erences, which were instrumental to creating our current condition, can
only render more of the same145. Considering this context, aggravated
by the current global climate crisis, we take on the challenge that em-
bracing the complexity of our time, we need to creatively look for theo-
ries and concepts that can help us make sense of the challenges that lie
ahead in a fast-changing and highly technologically mediated world.146
This is true, even when those theories and concepts are resisted and lie
at the periphery of scientific and political knowledge creation.

  The ontological turn addresses the exclusions performed by modern
concepts that are widely accepted in the western world: human, na-
ture, and technologies. Designing for the human is problematic – not to
say unethical— because the modern dominant concept of humans as
a normative category excludes the sexualised, racialised, and natural-
ised bodies, grouped under the less-than-human others.147 Similarly, the
dominant modern notion of nature places it in fundamental opposition

144 Mapuche , means people of the earth, and is the denomination of a group of in-
     digenous inhabitants in the southern and central regions in Chile and Argentina.

to humans, defined by the exclusion of what-is-not-human.148 This es-
sentialist European notion of nature differs from older historic meanings
in the European tradition, as well as other non-European meanings that
take a relational approach to it.149 Similarly with the concept of technol-
ogy, as modern neologism it was adopted to make invisible all kind of
inventiveness from less-than-human others (their creations are labelled
as handcrafts and hacks, stemming out of hobbies).150 Thus, from a crit-
ical stance, technology, as a term, has been instrumental to picturing
a modern male authority and the North’s superiority in industrial pro-
duction and scientific knowledge creation, as a male-led technologically
advantaged region.151

  Doing post-anthropocentric design152 demands not only a shift in the
object of our design practice and research moving beyond the modern
concepts of human, nature, and technology, but also the expansion of
the methodologies we use, for example prototyping for multi-species
coexistence in a Zoo.153 In this case, prototyping —relationally and per-
formatively— redefines the power relations between human and non-
human animals and, therefore, there is a reciprocal construction of
para-rights. This is the power of prototyping as an instance to empiri-
cally redefine our legal bodies. Furthermore, this has been extended to
knowledge creation which in design research and practice has also been
theorised under posthuman ontologies.154

design in the human-machine, and human-nature relationship, consid-
ered as mutually constituting ontologies. Fellow researchers will find in
this paper novel concepts, frameworks and theorical perspectives to en-
rich the repertoire of legal design research and practice. Legal design
practitioners will benefit from this contribution, as it contains examples
and references regarding how posthuman approaches to legal design can
be carried out and implemented in practice. A call for posthuman legal
design does not oppose HCD approaches, yet it positions itself outside
of them to critically assess their potential, and most importantly their
limitations. Furthermore, to tackle the grand challenges of our time, fos-
tering access to justice and the rule of law, requires a critical assessment
of our legal design practices. By doing that we can embrace new forms of
understanding the world we are co-designing together with more-than-
human agencies.

SERVICE DESIGN TO INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN

Margaret Hagan

Abstract
As more people go online to find help for their housing, family, and money prob-
lems, there is a large risk that they will find incorrect or unreliable information
there. Just like with misinformation regarding elections, political news, and public
health, online platforms like search engines and social media sites can strongly
influence people’s beliefs and choices. That means there is a huge opportunity to
connect people with their rights and public services to help them resolve their life
problems, as well as a huge risk that they will rely on incorrect information (or not
find any help information) and their life problem will spiral into a larger crisis.
The problem is that public service design is usually predicated on a two-way pub-
lic agency-to-user relationship that doesn’t acknowledge the growing prominence
and authority of private technology platforms like search engines and social media.
As described in this paper’s case study of the Better Legal Internet initiative, these
platforms have growing control over what information people see, what they see
as authoritative, and whether or how they connect with public services. As such,
public service agencies must engage in more ambitious design interventions that
go past traditional efforts of creating websites, applications, visual guides, and oth-
er agency-to-consumer services. Instead, they must also design infrastructure to
understand what is happening with public services on big tech platforms, to spot
misinformation problems and harms, and to engage with the platforms on improv-
ing their algorithms, interfaces, and other policies. This paper presents the detailed
case study of how our team identified and designed these kinds of research, data,
and expert infrastructure in the civil justice professional community. It also details
the robust efforts in the voting and medical services domains, to improve public
services through a mixture of adversarial and collaborative policy-making with big
tech platforms that were enabled through extensive research, data, and organiza-
tional infrastructure in their professional communities.

1. A Different Kind of Misinformation Problem: Public Services

In the past decade, more government agencies and nonprofits have real-
ized the threat misinformation and disinformation pose to a stable, dem-
ocratic society. What information does the public see about elections,
politics, pandemics, climate change, or other important policy topics?
Misinformation (incorrect information spread unintentionally or inten-
tionally) or disinformation (incorrect information spread intentionally by
actors) must be a public policy concern. If people rely on false, deceptive,
or misleading information on these topics, many harms might result.
Conspiracy theories might spread; people might avoid important servic-
es and treatments; there might be increased distrust in institutions; and
more people may participate in violence and antisocial behavior.1

  But much of the misinformation coverage and research has been fo-
cused on these high-profile policy domains. When policymakers focus on
the harms of online information, they are often discussing coordinated
campaigns of bots, trolls, and other deliberate efforts to spread false
or misleading information to the public.2 This misinformation research
points to an important new trend for policymakers: that more people
are relying on information from the Internet, including search engines
and social media, for important topics like health, politics, education,
foreign affairs, and the justice system. But most frequently the conver-

sation is framed around how to counteract deliberate misinformation
campaigns in political and health domains.

  This paper highlights another concerning trend with the public’s in-
creasing reliance on Internet platforms for information: low-quality in-
formation about public services. What rights does a person have? What
government programs can help them with housing, financial, family, and
other problems? What nonprofit services can help them with compli-
cated but important challenges like getting affordable housing, receiving
unemployment benefits, clearing a criminal record, securing a restrain-
ing order, or getting an immigrant visa? These are all public services that
can have a significant impact on an individual’s well-being and stability,
and taken as a whole can contribute to a more equitable, stable, and
cohesive society.

  Just like with the high-profile misinformation topics of health and pol-
itics, many people go to the Internet to find information on public ser-
vices or the underlying problems that the services are meant to help
with.3 But there is no apparent coordinated misinformation problem
with public services information online. Unlike with health, politics, or
other high-profile topics, there are no reports of troll farms or misinfor-
mation campaigns trying to spread misleading information about how to
submit a food assistance application or whether people have a right to a
free lawyer if they are facing eviction.

  Because of this lack of a coordinated misinformation campaign, public
service actors like government agencies, legal aid groups, or nonprofits
may assume that there is no need to focus on misinformation online.
Why should public service agencies spend precious resources on how
information spreads on the Internet when there are so many other chal-
lenges to tackle in delivering effective and impactful public services? The
current misinformation discourse’s focus on countering bots, influenc-
ers, rumors, and conspiracy theories doesn’t have much to offer these

agencies, which are not dealing with these kinds of coordinated misin-
formation problems with their public service information.

  This paper proposes that public service agencies, including govern-
ments and nonprofits that offer services meant to help the public, all
must have online misinformation strategies. Public service agencies
should focus on whether and how people can get crucial information
about rights, services, and processes on the Internet. And, at least as
of 2023, this focus must also include the big tech platforms that most
people use to search and prioritize information online. As detailed in this
paper’s case study, public services are not a simple two-party interaction
of agency to citizens. Rather, technology platforms – especially search
engines and social media sites – often now mediate whether and how
public service agencies connect with the public.

  This paper presents an example of this online public service informa-
tion challenge, in the domain of civil justice. How can public agencies
like courts, legal aid groups, bar foundations, and community navigator
programs connect with the public, to inform them of their rights, legal
processes, and free services available to help with civil justice matters
like debt collection, eviction, divorce, restraining orders, or criminal re-
cord clearing? Our Stanford Legal Design Lab had begun to tackle this
problem in 2015 with an initiative called Better Legal Internet, using a
human-centered design process in collaboration with partner courts,
legal aid groups, and government agencies. This paper profiles our in-
itiative and distills the lessons we learned about how challenging it is
to design effective interventions when private ‘big tech’ platforms play
such a large role in the relationship between public service agencies and
the public.

  Based on this ongoing research and design project, this paper ar-
gues that public service agencies should be investing in deliberate, hu-
man-centered design efforts to create infrastructure in their professional
community. This infrastructure includes:
1. Research Infrastructure: to understand how the public currently uses

   the Internet for the public service topic their agency is trying to pro-
   vide, and the life problems the service is meant to address; and to
   profile how the search engine and social media tech platforms decide
   what information to show the public in this topic area and how these
   tech companies’ policies are set; and
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  365

2. Data Infrastructure: to standardize the types of information that are
   relevant for users of public services, including what organizations can
   help them, what rules and guidance they should know about their
   problem area, and what official documents or tools they can rely on
   to address their problem;

3. Expert Infrastructure: to bring various officials, professionals, and
   experts (including community experts) in a policy domain together,
   so that there is a coherent approach to judge what information in
   this domain is authoritative and reliable, and what is misleading or
   harmful. Expert infrastructure also makes it easier for outside groups,
   like teams that work at big tech platforms, to understand this unique
   policy domain and build ongoing collaborations that get dedicated
   attention, policy-making, and engineering resources focused on this
   domain’s problems.

  This paper’s case study of the Better Legal Internet design initiative
raises several concerns from which other public service agencies and
civic innovation researchers can build. First, this case study found that
there is a particular misinformation problem with public services infor-
mation online: of high-quality information from government and non-
profit agencies being obscured and drowned out by low-quality content
from private actors. This misinformation problem is not one of the ma-
licious campaigns trying to deceive the public, as has been profiled in
the high-profile areas of vaccines or elections. Rather, this misinforma-
tion problem is about well-resourced for-profit companies trying to cap-
ture the Internet public’s attention and engagement on search engine
results pages and social media sites, and in the process diverting the
public away from government and nonprofit agencies’ information. This
is a different type of misinformation problem, but still, one that should
be a strong policy concern. The case study discusses this public services
misinformation problem so that more government bodies and nonprofit
agencies can explore their own information landscape on the Internet
and how to address it.

  Second, this paper highlights the need for new strategies to engage
big tech platforms in the government-to-citizen service relationship.
Even if there is more design work happening in public service agencies
to make these services more accessible and equitable, traditional ser-
366  Margaret Hagan

vice design approaches do not work when trying to solve a challenge like
public services online. Traditional service design techniques assume that
public service agencies and members of the public are two parties in a
relationship with each other.

  Our design work found that technology platforms are actually an in-
creasingly large third party in the government-to-citizen relationship
and that these platforms’ policies, interfaces, and algorithms play a huge
role in how public service agencies can connect with the public. It is not
enough for a public service agency to focus innovation efforts on its own
communications, marketing, websites, or guides. Rather, to truly be dis-
coverable and usable to the public, government and nonprofit agencies
must also engage with technology platforms to change their policies and
algorithms. This is a big shift, in acknowledging that even if an agency
has formal authority as a government body or public interest designa-
tion -- a third-party technology platform might actually be more influen-
tial with the public.

  This paper proceeds as follows. First, it gives an overview of the Better
Legal Internet initiative, as a case study of how a university-based de-
sign team tried to lead public service agencies through a service design
process to improve how they help the public with civil justice matters
online. It then highlights the main challenges that this initiative encoun-
tered: the large role that tech platforms play in online public services,
and the new kind of misinformation challenges that appeared. The paper
discusses the methods that the Better Legal Internet initiative adapted
into the traditional design process, including tech platform audits and
public-private design workshops. The conclusion discusses what future
researchers and public service agencies might do to build from this
work, including more mixed carrot-stick approaches to tech platforms’
policy-making, and coordinated interventions to improve the delivery of
public services online.

2. A Design Effort to Improve Public Services Online

The Stanford Law School’s Legal Design Lab is a justice innovation re-
search and design group that works on reforming the United States civil
justice system to be more human-centered, equitable, and accessible.
In 2015, the Lab launched the Better Legal Internet initiative to conduct
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  367

research and design new interventions regarding how people can find
legal help and public services on the Internet.4 The initiative’s objective
was to ensure that anyone searching for information on housing, debt,
family, or other related legal issues on the Internet, was made aware of
the public legal services, local laws, and the procedures to resolve their
issues.

  Our Lab chose to focus on Internet information and services because
it came up regularly in our design workshops and user interviews.5 When
we spoke to people using the courts or legal aid offices, they regularly
discussed how they tried to find information by searching online or go-
ing on forum sites to seek help.6 From an initial set of Internet searches
for legal help services, our team found that many government and non-
profits websites did a poor job in showing people’s rights, the law, or le-
gal procedures. We were concerned that these websites weren’t created
in a clear or accessible way, to serve the public. Our initial project goal
was to improve people’s ability to find helpful, authoritative information
when they went online for a query like ‘help with eviction’ or ‘how do I
respond to a debt collection lawsuit’.

  Notably, our Lab did not begin the Better Legal Internet initiative
framed in the language of misinformation or disinformation. Though
our team was aware of efforts in other policy domains to combat co-
ordinated campaigns to spread misleading and deceptive information
online,7 we did not consider this relevant to the civil justice space. Our

framing of the design was about the delivery of public services. The gov-
ernment and public interest groups had resources, experts, and guid-
ance to give the public, to improve their housing, finances, and family
outcomes. How could we better improve these public service agencies’
ability to deliver services to the public?

3. Taking the Traditional Public Service Design Approach, and Hitting
a Wall

We thought of the challenge as a typical service design challenge: a
well-meaning public interest group wanted to serve its potential audi-
ence better.8 How could we help them improve their communications,
interfaces, and other strategies to better serve the public? Naively, we
expected the design effort to be relatively straightforward: our Lab de-
sign team should help research people’s needs and preferences, then
craft better website designs through collaborative, creative sessions, and
then work with government and nonprofit networks to scale these best
practices to as many jurisdictions as possible.

  This traditional service design approach that we began with is sim-
ilar to what other public interest groups are embracing in their move
towards more human-centered innovation. Government agencies, ed-
ucational institutions, and nonprofits are increasingly focused on public
interest technology and innovation in order to better serve individual
people and improve all of society. White House issued an executive or-
der directing federal agencies to have customer experience plans, to en-
sure that people can have accessible, understandable, and empowering
government experiences.9 Court systems like the California state Judicial
Council have built design teams to research how people try to solve legal
problems in the state courts, and then created new digital platforms that

are more user-friendly.10 More governments have created design and in-
novation labs that are focused on improving people’s journeys through
a complicated, bureaucratic process.11 These efforts have all been pred-
icated on the belief that people should get these public resources in
low-burden, empowering ways -- and that this improved process design
will then build greater trust, authority, and confidence between people
and government institutions.

  Our Lab’s earlier innovation projects in the civil justice space had been
guided by the service design approach to good success. We used the hu-
man-centered design process to understand the user experience and sys-
temic policies that affected a given challenge.12 Our approach, like many
other public interest innovation teams, followed a ‘double diamond’
design process that involved a first phase of user, system, and market
research to uncover people’s main frustrations and needs, and the main
opportunities to improve the given system. In the second phase, we use
creative techniques to brainstorm many different possible solutions with
diverse stakeholders and gradually test, prototype, and refine them into
pilots that our partner agencies can implement.

  The double-diamond, empathy-driven service design approach
worked for our team and partners in other civic justice challenges. These
justice challenges ranged from improving traffic ticket courts, to how
people apply for guardianships of children, to how to make the divorce
process more efficient. We conducted design research and used user-fo-
cused insights to generate solutions for our government agency or non-
profit partner to implement. These solutions were typically aimed at the
public service agency or the public. For the public, we helped create us-

er-facing interventions for the agency to offer, like new handouts, fliers,
guides, navigators, websites, or apps. For the agency, we created back-
end system interventions, like changes to room layout or architecture,
creation of new staffing positions, the establishment of new data ex-
changes, or changes to court rules or procedures.13 Our team had gotten
comfortable in this two-party service design approach. We could either
encourage the system ‘owners’ (like court leadership, legal aid directors,
government agency workers or nonprofit executives) to change how the
system worked, or we could direct these agencies on how to make it
easier for people to find and use the system. Inherent in both of these
solution spaces is the assumption that the public service agencies held
power and authority over the public’s interactions with public services.

  As we entered into the Better Legal Internet initiative, the Lab team
assumed this two-party service design approach would be sufficient.
We could follow the same basic double diamond process and rely on
our usual strategies of user interviews, stakeholder workshops, jour-
ney mapping, and qualitative data-gathering to understand the current
breakdowns and opportunities for legal help information online. After
using these service design research methods, we would then be able to
craft user-facing and back-end interventions for our court and legal aid
partners to implement. Likely, our team predicted, we would end up with
proposals to help public service agencies improve their legal help web-
site interfaces, visuals, and content, so that more people could discover
and use these sites to protect their rights and resolve their conflicts.

  We began the project with a combination of user research and stake-
holder workshops, as typical in a service design project. For user re-
search, we conducted a structured survey of people online, to have them
share their past experiences searching for legal help online and then go
through a simulation exercise and share their experiences.14 Through
this survey of nearly 50 adults throughout the US, we began to uncover
a trend that would reveal itself more prominently: many people began

their Internet problem-solving on a tech platform like Google Search or a
social media site like Yahoo Answers. We also identified that many peo-
ple never reached the website or content from a public service agency.
People were starting on a private tech platform, expressing the need for
help with a problem or asking about a certain service, but they were not
ending up where they thought they would go. We had assumed most
people online would go to a public service agency’s website, like from a
court, a government agency, or a nonprofit legal aid group. Rather, these
organizations’ information was rarely appearing to people. Even if our
team thought of these organizations as authoritative and high quality,
most people did not visit them online when seeking help.

  We convened a stakeholder workshop in the autumn of 2015, to do
more design research on the challenge topic. Our team invited approx-
imately 25 court leaders, legal aid groups, civic technologists, and data
experts together for a day-long session on the largest problems these
groups saw with legal help services online, and what opportunities they
proposed to work on as priorities.15 This stakeholder workshop affirmed
that the starting challenge of our initiative was worthwhile. The stake-
holders agreed that the Internet held the potential to help courts and le-
gal groups better deliver services to the public. Some use cases included
helping immigrants through citizenship applications, helping people
without lawyers to navigate the court process, or empowering consum-
ers in submitting complaints to the department of justice. Stakeholders
agreed that currently many people were not able to find or use these
public services, but that it should be a priority to ensure they could.

  During this workshop, our team realized that the Better Legal Inter-
net challenge did not fit into the traditional service design framework.
Our stakeholders, particularly those who worked in civic technology
and data, flagged that our initial vision of possible solutions was overly
limited -- and not likely to succeed. If we followed a traditional service
design approach, our work would focus on improving public service
agencies’ communications, technology, and infrastructure. We might
help them build better front-end experiences, with websites that have

     accessed 14 February 2023.
372  Margaret Hagan

better interfaces, technology, and content. But, these civic technologist
stakeholders warned us, even if our initiative led to more courts build-
ing these better websites, this would not solve a key problem: what the
technology platforms would actually show to people.

  Even if government agencies and nonprofit groups thought of them-
selves as authoritative, search engines and social media platforms did
not necessarily grant them any authority. The public service agencies
were not at the center of the challenge. If we wanted to have the de-
sired policy impact, of connecting people online with high-quality public
services information that helped them resolve their life problems, we
needed to shift our focus from public service agencies to tech platforms.
Our team would have to alter our design process to focus on the tech
platforms’ policies, data infrastructure, and business models, in addition
to the government and nonprofits’ policies, technology, and services.
Our initiative would have to grapple with a different kind of policy and
service design, this time with private, for-profit technology companies.

4. Tech Companies and Public Service Design

Our stakeholders’ feedback led our team to begin a new research track,
layered onto our traditional service design work: profiling and under-
standing the technology companies that operate the dominant plat-
forms on the Internet. To solve our public service information challenge,
we had to employ qualitative and quantitative design research methods
to understand these companies’ behaviors, needs, frustrations, and in-
centives.

  To begin this process, we adapted our typical co-design methodology
of convening workshops in which mixed stakeholder groups did process
mapping, empathy maps, and brainstorming of new solutions for the
design challenge. By 2016 and 2017, our team had done enough back-
ground research to identify leaders in big tech who had some interest
in working on public service information challenges. By doing market
research and organizational mapping of technology companies and sec-
ondary research of industry publications and conferences, our team
could identify specific groups and leaders within search engine compa-
nies like Google and Microsoft, as well as social media companies like
Reddit, that might have some interest in improving how people find pub-
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  373

lic services help online. We also identified a cross-company nonprofit in-
itiative, of Schema.org, that had a mission in line with ours. The Schema.
org project, in which most of the big tech companies participated, aimed
to build more common data structures and consistent labeling of infor-
mation online, so that tech platforms could better match people to the
content that could help them.

  Our team convened another multi-stakeholder workshop in early 2017,
this time with representatives from big tech companies like Google and
Microsoft, industry initiatives like Schema.org, and public service agen-
cies in the civil justice space, like courts and legal aid groups.16 For this
two-day workshop, our focus was more precise than our first one. Rather
than explore many different needs, use cases, and possible solutions, we
narrowed in on the central question of how technology platforms might
alter their algorithms, policies, and interfaces to better deliver public ser-
vice information to the public. Our team no longer framed the challenge
as centered on the courts or legal aid groups. Rather, the framing now
was on the search engines and social media sites at the center. What
could they do, and what could the civil justice community do with them,
in order to ensure that the public could find high-quality public service
information when they looked online for help with evictions, debts, di-
vorce, deportation, or the like?

5. Design Research into Tech Platform Policymaking

It was during this second round of work that we fully understood that
our challenge might need to be framed as a misinformation problem.
What we, from our civil justice perspective, had thought about as a pub-
lic legal education problem (how do public agencies present information
about complex legal topics in engaging and user-friendly ways) might
need to be reframed as a technology platform policy problem, about
how they sort and moderate information. This would change how we
could run a human-centered design process to create impactful solu-

tions. If we were to make an impact, we would need to understand what
needs and preferences big tech companies had, as well as what kinds of
interventions could work to change their information policies.

  Our partners in the tech sector shared with us their outsider’s view
of our civil justice domain. This helped us to understand how for-profit,
worldwide, big tech companies approach problems and policymaking.
The design workshop helped us see our group of public service agen-
cies and information challenges the way that tech platform teams might:
as one more in a series of information domains. Though our court and
legal aid stakeholders were thoroughly immersed in the challenges of
getting people crucial information about housing, finances, family, and
employment law, and valued this for the public interest impact it could
have on society, this was not necessarily compelling to a tech company
team. They had many similar professional communities coming to their
companies, with complaints, demands, and proposals for how the tech
platforms should deal with information in their domain. It was not just
our group talking to them about a “Better Legal Internet” for civil jus-
tice problem-solving. There were similar teams of doctors, elections
commissioners, political researchers, consumer advocates, reproductive
rights specialists, and people working in other policy domains, all trying
to get on the tech platforms’ agenda to get the misinformation prob-
lems around their domain improved. The tech company teams did not
necessarily know about each of these policy and information domains:
what kinds of problems people were searching for, what a ‘good’ search
results page would look like, and what harms or benefits could result.

  During the workshop, they recommended that our civil justice com-
munity look to analogous professional communities, who had been able
to realize changes to search engines and social media sites for misinfor-
mation problems in their domains. In particular, our stakeholders urged
us to explore how the medical and public health community, and how
the voting and elections community, had approached tech platform com-
panies to work on information problems and solutions in their domain.
If we wanted to engage in a collaborative design and policy process with
the big tech platforms, then they pointed us toward these analogous
areas to understand what we should do.

  Our second workshop reaffirmed that engaging big tech platforms
would be essential to improving public services on the platform. It did
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  375

not give a step-by-step blueprint of exactly how to engage these compa-
nies in the reform of their platforms for civil justice information, in either
a ‘carrot’ approach of collaborations and rewards or a ‘stick’ approach of
accountability and criticisms. Instead, we left that second workshop with
a mandate to explore how other analogous professional communities
had reformed tech platforms’ policies and to map out the levers that
public service agencies could have in changing how tech platforms show
and prioritize information to the public.

6. Strategies to Engage Big Tech in Public Service Challenges

Our project had now officially transformed into one focused on informa-
tion. We began to explore the literature on how different policy commu-
nities had found misinformation or disinformation problems for topics
related to their policies, and then how they worked to solve these infor-
mation challenges on the Internet. This research was to help us scope
possible solutions for our overarching design process. What could we
learn from analogous efforts that could guide possible new communi-
cation, product, service, or policy designs? Much of the literature about
addressing online information problems focused on intentionally mis-
leading or deceptive information on tech platforms. The online informa-
tion research and policy recommendations often focused on responding
to trolls, bots, influencers, or foreign actors attempting to spread harm-
ful information for political reasons or for profit.17

  The strategies to respond to deliberate misinformation campaigns
did not seem entirely relevant to the civil justice information problems
online. In our workshops and discussions with legal aid and court ex-
perts, we asked lawyers and technologists if they had ever seen delib-
erate misinformation or disinformation in the civil justice space on the
Internet. A few trends emerged. First, some for-profit law firms or legal
services groups would label their websites in terms like “legal aid” or
buy adwords with keywords like “legal aid” to attract people who were

17 For example, see health misinformation strategies at Vivek H Murthy, ‘Confronting
     Health Misinformation: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on Building a Healthy
     Information Environment’ (2021) <https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sur-
     geon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf> accessed 13 February 2023.

seeking out free public services. This kind of misinformation was about
mislabeling sites and misleading ads to direct people away from public
services and towards private ones. The other misinformation trend we
heard about was one without a deliberate actor behind it. We heard
from legal aid website administrators who regularly saw search engines
mislead people to their local website, with local legal information only
relevant to residents of their state - -when the people were in another
region or country altogether. This misinformation problem was more
about big tech platforms being insensitive to the importance of jurisdic-
tion, and thus mistakenly sending users to information that was wrong
or harmful to them.

  We thus began to focus on information challenges and misinformation
strategies that were more akin to these problems: where big tech plat-
forms may be showing misleading, deceptive, or low quality informa-
tion to people who were trying to use the platforms to seek help with a
life problem. Rarely were these the work of coordinated actors trying to
use misinformation for profit or political influence. Rather, the concern
was the quality and accuracy of the information the big tech platforms
were spotlighting for people. Were the platforms’ policies about what to
recommend or refer people to ill-equipped to judge what was accurate
and reliable? Was the localized, specialized knowledge in the civil justice
domain too difficult for the big tech platforms to make sense of and pro-
duce quality results around?

7. Strategies to Tackle Misinformation in Voting & Elections Services

We began to frame our challenge as one of a peculiar kind of misinfor-
mation: for a complex, fractured topic area that had many special and
local rules, services, and documentation, it seemed that big tech plat-
forms built for national or global scale may struggle to know what infor-
mation to show a person seeking help. For this kind of misinformation,
we found some professional communities that could be models for the
civil legal justice community and other public service agencies. Through
the public-facing accounts of their misinformation research, creation of
new information initiatives, and engagement with big tech platforms, we
were able to identify strategies for our community to consider.
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  377

  In the voting and elections domain, we found that professionals had
organized a deliberate effort to collaborate with big tech platforms to
counteract misinformation and promote authoritative information from
public service agencies. This professional community engaged in a da-
ta-driven, multistakeholder process that brought government officials,
big tech teams, and nonprofit foundations to collaborate on solutions.
The Voting Information Project, developed as a collaborative effort be-
tween Pew Charitable Trusts, recent graduates of a university’s public
policy department, big tech platforms like Google, and local election of-
ficials.18 It brought these groups together to create a coordinated, stand-
ardized, national dataset of election rules and procedures. This central
database of information can be considered the ‘authority’ on voting
information in the country. It provides specific procedures, locations,
requirements, and other actionable information to help people ensure
they can participate in elections in their local jurisdiction.

  The database is accessible to big tech platforms like Google Search,
Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter so that they can know reliably what local
voting information to display to their users. Teams at the big tech plat-
forms can take the verified, standardized data and then integrate it into
special banner ads, search engine responses, voice assistant replies, or
even as a reference point when another post is flagged for misinforma-
tion. The voting community’s database provides a convenient authority
for the big tech, to help their teams rely on this community to give de-
tailed, accurate information when their users are seeking it, or when their
users might be seeing incorrect or harmful information on this topic.

  Building such a national, standardized database is a major effort. It
entails working with local officials throughout thousands of jurisdictions
around the country, to get their buy-in and participation, as well as their
follow-through in providing their local information into the standardized
data format. It also entails quality review, to ensure that the information
is (and continues to be) reliable, so that the big tech platforms can rely
on it without incident. It is an ongoing effort to maintain quality, as rules,
contact points, hours, and other details may change.

     org/projects> accessed 9 February 2022.
378  Margaret Hagan

  This database approach was not the only strategy that big tech com-
panies took to combat elections-related misinformation. Currently, so-
cial media big tech like Meta have extensive suites of automated and
human review of information about elections, particularly to deal with
bots and coordinated disinformation campaigns.19 The structured data
about public services related to where to vote, how to vote, and what to
bring, were more analogous to the civil justice space. We still took note
of the extensive counter-misinformation strategies that search engines
and social media sites used, but tended to focus in on the strategies to
promote high quality, local, actionable information for a person with a
query (rather than trying to spot and fight ‘bad actors’ trying to spread
disinformation).

  The elections community’s misinformation strategies offered one
blueprint for the civil justice community to follow. There could be a sim-
ilar collaborative effort among technology companies, civic leaders, and
legal subject matter experts to develop a system that identifies and vets
authoritative information about how people can make use of their local
court and legal aid systems to address their housing, money, family, and
other problems. This information should be represented as structured
data, in labeled databases that laid out what rules, documents, time-
lines, and services were relevant for which jurisdictions and problem
types. Once the civil justice information was consistently structured and
saved in one central place, then it could be opened as an API for big tech
platforms to use. Search engines might use the standardized legal help
data in call-outs or banners on search results pages, to flag authoritative
and trustworthy answers. Social media could counter any possible misin-
formation with data from this API. People visiting these platforms would
be connected with local, authoritative info -- perhaps without ever hav-
ing to click on a court or legal aid website.

  This strategy, to sum up, was about organizing the local leaders of the
professional community, setting a common data standard, managing the
community and automation techniques to get each local jurisdictions’
information correctly recorded in the standard, and then establishing
the legitimacy and governance apparatus of this new central database

     ing-for-elections-on-facebook/> accessed 14 February 2023.
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  379

and API. This strategy was collaborative and technocratic. The goal was
to change big tech platforms’ policies and behaviors by offering them a
useful, authoritative API of structured data that helped the platforms
serve their customers better, and that outsourced the granting of au-
thority to the professional community so that the big tech platforms’
teams did not have to make difficult decisions about who held authority
on a topic. In this strategy, the onus was to make fractured, localized
professional communities somewhat unified, at least about standard-
ized procedural data and agreeing on the authority and importance of
the central database and API.

8. Strategies to Tackle Misinformation in Medical Services

In the medical domain, professional communities have dedicated ex-
tensive research and implementation strategies to change how big tech
platforms respond to people’s health information queries and posts. Like
with the elections domain, many of the strategies have been collabora-
tive, with big tech teams working with medical institutions, individual
experts, and government agencies to identify risks, harms, and better
practices.

  In 2015, Google Search team leaders shared that they worked with
in-house medical doctors at Google and the Mayo Clinic institution to
create a new intervention to prevent medical misinformation from ap-
pearing on the search results page.20 Unlike with the voting, this inter-
vention was not about sourcing a central database of structured, local
procedural information. Rather, for medical information challenges, the
big tech team had identified common diseases and problems, like con-
cussions, celiac diseases, or pink eye. They then created customized con-
tent to display to people searching for these issues. Their team of experts
compiled, curated, and reviewed the information that would be shown
in special knowledge panels to users. In effect, people who searched for
keywords that indicate a common health issue would not be shown the
usual search results.

     Knowledge Graph’ (Google: The Keyword Blog, 15 February 2015) 1 <https://blog.
     google/products/search/health-info-knowledge-graph/> accessed 26 April 2021.
380  Margaret Hagan

  In the medical domain, big tech platforms like Google decided to
change their default policy, by not deferring to its standard search rank
algorithm’s prediction. Rather, they decided to give special treatment
to this topic area, invest in expert content-creation and review (even
including special medical illustrations they commissioned), and to give
large amounts of the search results page’s real estate to this curated
knowledge panel rather than to ads or top results. Since 2015, big tech
platforms have continued to build and expand on this strategy, by work-
ing with official institutions and experts as trusted partners to provide
curated content about the given topic.21

  Social media platforms like Facebook began to track pages and users
who shared misinformation, including around vaccines, COVID-19, cli-
mate change, and elections, to create interventions that might slow or
stop misinformation -- including context references linking to independ-
ent fact-checkers or warnings from the platform itself that posts might
be false.22 Twitter also instituted a medical misinformation policy to flag
or contextualize tweets that may include misleading information about
health.23 This policy ended in November 2022, with the change in own-
ership of the tech platform.24

  This amount of policy change and labor for the medical domain may
have been a result of a combination of factors. It could be that the med-
ical community created extensive research that showed how many peo-
ple were seeking health information on the Internet, highlighting the
scale of the problem.25 Another reason for this policy activity may be

because of how many government officials, journalists, and researchers
published on how dangerous health misinformation can be to individuals
and to society, and how frequently this misinformation was appearing
on big tech platforms.26 This emphasis on the size of the misinformation
problem, and the level of harm that misinformation could cause, was
likely a key factor in the big tech platforms adjusting their algorithms,
interfaces, and rules around medical information.

  From our research and conversations about how the medical com-
munity had been able to change big tech platform’s policies, we identi-
fied a few strategies. One was to create research and public discussion
about exactly what was happening with user’s use of the Internet, how
big tech platforms provided information on these topics, what specific
misinformation dynamics were occurring, and what harms could result.
In order to get tech companies to change their policies, one strategy is
to launch a coherent research agenda in a professional community that
could give a handle on key breakdowns, issues, and behavior patterns.
This research and discussion could then both help the tech teams un-
derstand what solutions might be possible, and also publicly pressure
them to address the misinformation problems that had been officially
documented and publicized.

  A second strategy in the medical community mirrored that of the elec-
tions community: investing in common data standards for their com-
munity’s topics. In the medical domain, experts worked directly with a
nonprofit organization, Schema.org, whose members include leading
big tech platforms like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. Medical leaders
from universities like Harvard and Duke, along with government groups
like the National Center for Biotechnology Information, worked with
big tech platforms’ teams through the Schema.org nonprofit apparatus
and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that focuses on Internet
standards.27 This collaboration between medical leaders and tech teams

led to new data standards to represent health and medical information,
as a standardized schema. This health and medical schema could then
be applied to authoritative resources (like government or hospital web-
sites), so that search engines and social media could better identify and
make sense of the information they were sharing, and match it to peo-
ple’s searches.28 The schema provided an infrastructure to improve big
tech platforms’ ability to serve quality results to their users, avoid mis-
matches, and prevent other misinformation harms. The health/medical
schema was formally integrated into the Schema.org standards, which
the large search engines all use in their crawling of the Internet and their
search rank policies. It is notable that no other professional communi-
ties have a specialized schema for their topics included in the Schema.
org standard.29 The medical community, though, was able to engage
with the tech platform teams to create this extensive, coordinated data
standard that could alter the platforms’ policies around medical topics.

  A third strategy was to present a coherent group of experts who could
represent the professional community as ‘authorities’, who could create,
review, and approve content for the big tech platforms to show to users.
This effort in the medical community has been more extensive than in
the voting community. Perhaps because of the huge number of health is-
sues and complexity around symptoms and consequences, compared to
the more straightforward and procedural information about elections,
this community has had a different approach to preparing information
for tech platforms to use. Rather than creating one central database
with an API like the voting information project, the medical community
instead has developed ongoing relationships between its private and
public institutions and the tech companies themselves. They have an
ongoing content review and creation relationship, to be able to create
authoritative content and also to respond to possible misinformation.

     organizations, services, creative works, or events. Of all the possible topic areas
     (like government services, politics, elections, education, the environment or be-
     yond) only the health and medical field has its own specialized data standard with-
     in Schema.org.
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  383

  These strategies taken from the medical domain might indicate that
the civil justice community should invest in research about what kinds of
misinformation problems are happening for their topics and users. The
community might also try to make a more coherent network of experts
who could advise the tech platforms. All of this points to more organiza-
tion of the professional community, so that it would be easier to engage
with the tech companies. Also, as we learned from the elections com-
munity, creating common data standards in partnership with big tech
platform teams could also lead to collaborative new policy-making about
what the platforms show to people and how they address misinforma-
tion.

  More concrete data would be needed about what people are search-
ing for in this domain, what the tech platforms show them, and what
harms and information problems are occurring on the platforms. Only
if there was reliable knowledge about the tech platforms’ performance,
and explanation of why it was meaningful, concerning or harmful, would
there be a way to convince tech platform teams to be interested in this
area.

9. Researching the Tech Platforms’ Policies on Authority & Importance

Our research into analogous domains like voting and medical informa-
tion helped us see professional communities’ approaches to changing
tech platforms’ policies. These accounts of successful strategies could
help us deduce how tech platforms’ teams carried out policymaking.
How did they decide which kinds of topics and services merited atten-
tion, labor by their company teams, and special treatment on their plat-
form? How did they decide what kinds of information and sources to
designate as high quality or authoritative on their platform? How did
they choose to give some organizations or topic areas special treatment
in their interface designs, or adjustment of their algorithm?

  As many researchers have identified before, tech platforms like search
engines and social media sites are political.30 Even if the choice of what

     Search Engines Matters’ (2000) 16 The Information Society 169; Laura Ann Granka,

384  Margaret Hagan

Siri says back to a person, what Google Search ranks as the top, or what
Instagram shows in a feed is governed by technical systems, the humans
within the tech companies have designed the algorithms and interfaces
to prioritize some organizations and topics as more important and au-
thoritative than others. Our Better Legal Internet design team saw that
some communities, like the medical and voting professional commu-
nities, had been able to use a mix of accountability and collaboration
strategies to affect big tech platforms’ policies. Their strategies led to
changes in what was shown or spoken to users of big tech platforms on
designated topics. It changed how possible harmful misinformation was
flagged or removed. It changed how professionals could do outreach on
important, timely topics like upcoming elections, vaccination campaigns,
or masking mandates -- by having the tech platforms prioritize this infor-
mation and proactively show it to their millions of users.

  These public accounts of how and why big tech platform teams collab-
orated with professional communities helped us create some hypothe-
ses of what the platforms’ internal policies on authority and importance
were. The accounts showed that the teams were often motivated about
improving the quality of high-stakes information online, to prevent harm
that could result if their platform users were shown misleading, false, or
confusing information on a topic. They were also motivated to fix qual-
ity problems, where outside groups called out the platform for showing
incorrect, irrelevant, or harmful misinformation to its users. In addition,
they seemed to be motivated to collaborate with well-organized profes-
sional communities that could offer coherent decisions about what kinds
of information were quality, authoritative, or harmful. It seemed that,
especially on high-stakes public service matters, the tech teams wanted
to be able to have a trustworthy, third-party organization make judg-
ment calls about authority and quality, so that they would not have to
make these specialized judgments and then possibly face reproach from
users, journalists, or government institutions.

  These policy values and motivations were all suppositions our team de-
duced. We could not know for sure about how big tech platforms’ execu-
tives and product teams decided which topic areas to invest specialized
resources in, when and how to change their algorithms or interfaces, or
which organizations to engage as authorities. Private companies’ policy-
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  385

making happens within a black box, with little public transparency about
how or why their decisions are made.

  That said, our design team did find some documents from big tech
platforms that laid out their information policies with some clarity: train-
ing manuals. Our team identified a publicly-available internal document
used by Google Search teams to train new staff and contractors whose
job it is to manually review websites and score them for quality.31 This
internal document gave clear insight into their official policies about
what kinds of topics deserved greater attention, content curation, and
engineering resources to prevent misinformation harms. The document
encouraged website raters to use a “YMYL” or “Your Money Or Your Life”
policy to evaluate the topics being discussed on a given website. The
policy laid out that if the topic would strongly impact a person’s finances,
personal security, health, or other high-stakes interest, then any web-
site should be evaluated with more scrutiny or care. The search engine
results might also reflect this YMYL policy. If the company teams thinks
that a given topic (like, vaccine information, or a possible eviction) is suf-
ficiently “YMYL”, then they might make the search engine results page
more populated with public services, they might take all ads off, or they
might manually put a hotline phone number at the top of the results in
a call-out box.

  The other key official policy we found, at least at Google Search, was
that of E-E-A-T: expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trust-
worthiness. Google Search trained its website rater teams to evaluate
whether web content was created by people who could demonstrate
these E-E-A-T factors, especially if the content was about a YMYL topic.
The Google Search team gave the example of a user searching online
about how to file their taxes.32 The platform has a policy that this topic
is YMYL because it will have major consequences for a person’s finances
and compliance with the law (as well as possible risks of financial pen-

alties or criminal violations). Because the topic is YMYL, then the search
raters should pay particular attention to content about tax filing, by rat-
ing content and sites higher if they can demonstrate higher E-E-A-T.

  Internal policies like YMYL and E-E-A-T resonated with what our team
identified in the medical and voting domains. The professional commu-
nities had gathered data and presented information about why their do-
main’s topics were YMYL. They could demonstrate that misinformation
problems were occurring on the platforms, and that incorrect, mislead-
ing or deceptive information in this topic area would have significant
harm to people’s money, life, and stability. Likely, the tech companies
also had data about the volume of misinformation problems occurring
on the platform, or they could find this data once the professional com-
munity published reports, held meetings, or approached them with mis-
information concerns.

  The professional community also organized their domain to better
supply tech companies with E-E-A-T content. They organized experts
from across many jurisdictions and sub-domains to increase the online
content they were creating, to present this content in standardized and
coordinated ways, and to engage with tech companies through official
partnerships.

10. Public Service Design Focus on Infrastructure

With this design research into big tech platform policymaking, our Bet-
ter Legal Internet team changed how we approached our typical hu-
man-centered design process to improve public services. Rather than
focus our interventions solely on designing excellent websites and con-
tent with courts and legal aid groups, we prioritized the design of infra-
structure. If our civil justice community was to reach its goals of building
awareness and uptake of public services like legal aid, self-help guides,
and court services, then the highest impact was likely to be in creat-
ing coherent research, information, and organizational infrastructure in
our community. Following from the voting and medical communities,
we needed to invest in making our professional community and poli-
cy domain more coherent. Coordinated infrastructure would not only
strengthen our professional community, but it would give this communi-
ty power to either hold big tech platforms accountable in an adversarial
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  387

way, or to engage big tech platforms in collaborative policymaking and
design interventions.

  Our Better Legal Internet team ran several more workshops and stake-
holder groups among civil justice professionals, in which we presented
the strategies we had gleaned from analogous professional communities
and from the tech companies’ internal training documents. From these
sessions, we then identified the infrastructure interventions to pilot in
order to have an impact on public services on the Internet.

  Research Infrastructure. We identified that the civil justice space had
very little empirical research on what people were searching for online,
what misinformation problems were occurring on big tech platforms,
and what harms or risks were occurring. Thus, our Better Legal Internet
team identified research methods to begin gathering this data. With the
support of the Pew Charitable Trusts and collaboration with computer
scientists who had previous experience with auditing tech platforms’ po-
litical information policies, our team designed and launched legal help
search audits. These audits involved thousands of searches on Google
for common civil justice queries, like “help I’ve been evicted” or “how
do I get a restraining order”, from different zip codes. The audits record
what Google shows to people in response to these queries, including the
domain, the url, and the type of interface presentation.

  These audits produce empirical evidence about what a platform is pri-
oritizing for our topic areas, what misinformation problems are occurring
and with what frequency, and what opportunities exist. For example, our
search audits gave us evidence that Google was rarely showing public in-
terest websites to the public, but was rather favoring national commer-
cial entities for justice searches.33 They also revealed that Google was
frequently showing information from the incorrect jurisdiction, which
could lead to people following the wrong rules, losing their case, and
facing legal harm. More research is needed about people’s behavior on
big tech platforms, the platforms’ behavior, harms, and opportunities,
but the search audit research has given an initial set of evidence that

     Search Engine Algorithm’s Quality for Legal Help Searches (Forthcoming)’ [2023]

388  Margaret Hagan

can be used to hold platforms accountable and also to encourage them
to consider this domain as a priority, for possible special focus and labor.

  Data Infrastructure. Our team compared the civil justice information
landscape to that in the medical and voting space. We lacked a common
machine-readable data standard to represent the different life problems
that people experience, and which they might ask about on a search en-
gine or social media site. To this end, our team designed the Legal Issues
Taxonomy (LIST) to represent the many different civil justice problems
and queries that people might have.34 LIST built on top of many previous
legal problem taxonomies that legal aid groups and funders used in or-
der to manage their case systems or funding requirements.

  In addition, our team designed another data infrastructure inter-
vention: Legal Schema markup.35 Following the medical community’s
example, we identified how legal information and services might need
specialized markup in Schema.org, so that there could be accurate and
consistent representations of legal topics that search engines and social
media platforms could automatically understand. We integrated the LIST
problem codes into the Legal Schema markup, so that tech platforms’
automated systems could understand what specific problems certain
government and legal aid websites could help with. We also commu-
nicated the Legal Schema Markup design to teams at Schema.org non-
profit, the W3C community, and Google Search teams directly, following
the example of the medical community.

  Our hope was that this data infrastructure would present our civil jus-
tice domain as coherent and accessible to the tech platforms, so they
might prioritize new algorithmic policies and design interventions to im-
prove the quality of information they showed to their users. The prob-
lem goes back to the black box of tech platforms’ policymaking, though.
Even if our community creates a data infrastructure and presents it to
the platforms, we cannot know if and how they take note of it, or if they

  Expert Infrastructure. The final area for our infrastructure design
was on creating a more coherent set of experts with which to create
high-quality, authoritative content and also to interface with tech com-
panies. Our team designed new expert cohorts, to begin building a clear
national network out of the civil justice community’s highly localized,
fragmented organization.

  First, we created a small cohort of legal aid groups to work with us on
implementing data standards and running search audits.36 We then ex-
panded this informal cohort into two more formalized groups. The Legal
Internet Steering Committee is an invite-only expert group of leaders
from courts, government agencies, legal aid, university labs, nonprofit
technology consultants, for profit technology providers, and others who
have a demonstrated record of working on public interest justice inno-
vation. The LISC group meets quarterly to discuss how civil justice issues
are playing out on the Internet, what research is happening, what mis-
information problems are arising, and what possible policies, technol-
ogies, or other interventions might improve how legal help is provided
online. The LISC group is one that could potentially partner with big tech
platforms’ teams, like the voting and medical communities have. It could
also issue reports, write editorials, and hold tech platforms accountable
for how they perform on civil justice.

  The second expert community is the Legal Help Online Cohort. This
community is for the groups that administer public services websites
for civil justice issues. This includes web administrators, technologists,
designers, and content-writers. Our goal with this cohort is to educate
them on tech companies’ policies, and empower them to make the
strongest possible websites to rank high on the platforms and effectively
connect with their target audience. Even if we cannot officially get tech
companies to change their policies around civil justice topics, the Legal
Help Online Cohort can make the strongest possible content for the cur-
rent policies -- with strong search engine optimization strategies, con-

tent that can easily be excerpted by Siri or Google Knowledge Panels,
or that can be shared on social media. This Cohort might also become a
future source of official, authorized content, like has happened with the
medical community’s official content collaborations with Google.

11. Directions for Improving the Impact of Public Service Design

These three areas of infrastructure are ongoing, strategic design inter-
ventions. When we began our design effort to improve how people find
public services information online about civil justice problems, we did
not think this was the kind of intervention we would be designing. We
had been following the service design framework that many other gov-
ernment agencies and innovation labs have -- about offering engaging,
user-friendly apps, documents, and services to help a person through
a complex system. Our team had expected to follow this pathway, and
end up designing interventions like a user-friendly website, an intuitive
interactive form-filling app, a supportive hotline text message flow, or a
usable process map to explain people’s rights and options.

  From our design journey over the past 8 years, though, we advise
other public services designers to prioritize infrastructure interventions
in addition to these more traditional kinds of service, communication,
and technology interventions. This is especially true as big tech plat-
forms play a growing role as brokers of authority and information. One
exchange from a Better Legal Internet design workshop is particularly
enlightening. A state supreme court justice was speaking with a search
engine platform engineer. The justice asked, why is my court’s webpage
not the first result on your search engine, if someone in my jurisdiction is
searching for help with a lawsuit or their rights? The engineer responded
that the court’s webpage was likely not very good. If more people had
clicked on it, spent time on it, and linked to it, then that would have
demonstrated that the website had valuable content to users. The fact
that the court’s webpage rarely appeared on the first page of search
results was proof to the search engine that it wasn’t user-centered, and
shouldn’t be prioritized in the results. The justice replied, my court is the
local authority, and you should be putting it at the top of the results by
default. The engineer replied that they would only do so if the website
proved valuable to users.
Designing Public Services in the Age of Big Tech  391

  This exchange highlights some broader trends that government agen-
cies, nonprofits, and other public service groups must be aware of. First,
these public service agencies’ authority is not always a given. Big tech
platforms, especially search engines and social media sites, often are
the place where people go to understand their problems, get informa-
tion, and decide what is reliable. The private platforms thus have much
of the authority, and they can decide which organizations or experts to
delegate authority to. A court official cannot order a tech company to
put their website as the first result. The tech platform has its own poli-
cy-making process that is largely opaque.

  That said, there are strategies to engage big tech platforms’ execu-
tives and product teams in improving how public services information
appears to their users and in addressing misinformation harms that may
occur. This paper summarizes many of these specific strategies and mes-
saging frames that span the adversarial, that focus on accountability for
misinformation frequency and harms, and the collaborative, that focus
on ways that professional communities can work with private companies
to improve information quality and benefit the public.

  For those working in an area in which they are attempting to commu-
nicate with the public, to get them access to rights, services, documents,
and other important public interest help, they might expand upon ef-
forts to improve customer experience and usability. To have maximum
impact, they might invest in three key areas of infrastructure -- empirical
research, data standards, and expert organization -- so that they might
pressure and collaborate with private technology companies to know
the scope of their misinformation problems, have reliable and coordi-
nated information to offer people online, and to have ongoing design
work that responds to new technological advancements and misinfor-
mation threats. Infrastructure design is not easy or straightforward, but
it will provide the basis for better policy-making and service designs in
the future.

OF LEGAL DESIGN THROUGH THE CASE OF “LES
SURLIGNEURS”, A LEGAL-CHECKING MEDIA
OUTLET

Vincent Couronne, Joachim Savin, Marie-Sophie de Clippele
and Apolline Le Gall

Abstract
In the wake of numerous fact-checking initiatives, the association “Les Surligneurs”,
founded in France in 2017 and disseminating in Europe (Belgium), aims to carry
out legal-checking, i.e. to verify the conformity with the law of statements made
by public figures, particularly in the media. Legal-checking also aims to shed light
on the political debate through legal issues. The project follows some clear design
patterns (yellow colour, a recognisable logo, the structure of the short articles to be
more readable, etc.) and could therefore be seen as part of the legal design move-
ment. However, the project Les Surligneurs was created without knowing about
the legal design movement. This movement only started to gain interest in France
in 2018-2019. Moreover, the project did not really follow the canonical approach
(inherited from design thinking) of a legal design project: it was not the result of a
user-research approach. This case study therefore raises the following questions:
to which academic field does design thinking belong, and which frame should we
use to look at projects at the intersection of design and law? These issues will
be critically assessed in this paper, paying attention to the rise of the legal design
movement and the real improvement in terms of meeting users’ needs.

1. Introduction

This article aims to provide an in-depth exploration and critique of the
concept of legal design and its current utilisation in France. It stems from
our experience as involuntary participants in legal design through the
Les Surligneurs project. Our motivation to write this piece arises from
our respective professional backgrounds—Marie-Sophie de Clippele and
Vincent Couronne in law, and Joachim Savin and Apolline Le Gall in de-
sign—collaborating and offering diverse viewpoints on the methods and
outcomes associated with this evolving practice.

  Since 2017, we have observed a gradual proliferation of the term ‘le-
gal design’ within our professional circles. While the legal domain has
shown justified enthusiasm in embracing novel methodologies, cater-
ing to user interests, and acknowledging the human aspects and various
touchpoints of law, the design sphere has not paralleled this same level
of engagement. As an industrial designer with a background from a Na-
tional High Education institution, Joachim Savin, one of the co-authors,
noticed numerous constraints that prompted critical questions: Firstly,
why has this approach gained significant traction in the legal field de-
spite its evident design limitations? Secondly, how can we cultivate a
professional culture in legal design that truly embodies the essence of
design?

  Drawing from the Les Surligneurs case, this paper will explore alter-
native methods of collaboration between lawyers and designers within
legal design projects. Indeed, we noticed some limitations of legal de-
sign, some stemming from design thinking principles and some specific
to its implementation in the French context. Finally, we will examine how
Les Surligneurs unveils novel challenges that extend beyond the conven-
tional boundaries of Design or Law.

2. Les Surligneurs: a Legal-Checking Media Outlet Designed for Public
Debate

2.1. Genesis, Missions, and Design of Les Surligneurs

In the wake of numerous fact-checking initiatives, the association Les
Surligneurs was founded in France in 2017 by flatmates Vincent Cou-
ronne, a researcher in law, and Joachim Savin, an industrial designer.
Before that, Vincent Couronne had started a blog in August 2016 on
“Contre-vérités en droit européen” (“Counter-truths in European law”).
Playing with the idea of a radio station, Couronne and Savin eventual-
ly changed the blog to Les Surligneurs and aimed for a bigger scope:
to refocus the public debate on the law, what it says, what it allows or
forbids and how politicians should take the law into consideration and
respect it when making statements in the media. Les Surligneurs started
as a university website and found immediate success as the project was
A Critical Assessment of the Notion of Legal Design...  399

launched during the French presidential elections in 2017. It drew the at-
tention of journalists, who were eager to use legal arguments to counter
political statements. Yet, the project at that time attracted less attention
from the larger public.

  Les Surligneurs carries out legal-checking, i.e. checks on the conform-
ity with the law of statements made by public figures, particularly in the
media. Legal-checking also aims to shed light on the political debate
through legal issues.

   These two objectives are achieved through “legal highlighting” (sur-
lignages) or “legal clarification” (éclairages) operations, in which law
professors, or students under the supervision of professors, or legal
practitioners, write short articles, which are easily accessible to the pub-
lic. The legal issues are then clearly apparent: legally false, problematic,
to be qualified, incomplete, etc. Statements are “highlighted”, and po-
litically debated subjects are “clarified” in law. These articles are then
published online (https://lessurligneurs.eu/) and disseminated on social
networks, all with a view to feeding the public debate. The association
of Les Surligneurs has grown over the years and now has a full team with
Vincent Couronne and Joachim Savin still involved as co-founders and
Couronne also acting as publications director. Moreover, several enthu-
siasts have joined the board of directors, including Professor Jean-Paul
Markus, who acts as editing director, Tania Racho, as training director,
and Audrey Darsonville, Emma Cacciamani, and Juliette Toussaint, re-
spectively acting as president, vice-president, and secretary-general of
the association. Les Surligneurs has an Editing Committee (11 members
currently) and a Technical Committee (4 members). The association also
relies on more than one hundred legal students, researchers and prac-
titioners who scout for and flag problematic statements in the media,
post them on an internal Whatsapp Group, are then, guided by Jean-
Paul Markus regarding whether or not this deserves legal-checking, draft
the legal highlighting or clarification and publish it on the website and
on social media.

  Over time, the project has extended its offering, and, besides the ar-
ticles, it currently develops podcasts, makes up quizzes to test users’
knowledge of the political and legal arena, and hosts events, such as
a legalthon or a webinar on promoting fact-checking on social media.
Les Surligneurs also publishes interviews with actors in the field, such
400  V. Couronne, J. Savin, M.S. de Clippele and A. Le Gall

as with the Ukrainian journalist Alina Mosendz, who set up a media to
fight fake news.1 Members often take part in the public debate by collab-
orating with other media outlets (press, television, etc.), gaining strong
recognition of the added value and importance of such legal checking in
the broader – mostly French – media.

  Building on this intensive media coverage (more than one thousand
legal checking articles have been published, with millions of page views),
Les Surligneurs has become more than a university collective and is now
recognized as a media outlet. The association has been a signatory of
the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) Code of Principles since
July 2021.2 Les Surligneurs also takes part in the Journalism Trust initia-
tive, from Reporter Sans Frontières, and helped drafting a transparency
report in that respect.3 It is a member of the European Digital Media
Observatory (EDMO)4 and the French-speaking platform for the initiative
of the fight against disinformation.5

  Finally, the media outlet goes beyond national borders and is also pres-
ent in Belgium, with a sister website.6 In Belgium, Professor Pierre-Olivier
de Broux is Editing Director with a team of three other professors in the
Editing Committee: Christine Guillain, Jogchum Vrielink and Marie-So-
phie de Clippele. They are all professors at the same university, Univer-
sité Saint-Louis – Bruxelles and are partly involved in a class, following
the format of a legal clinic, around the project Les Surligneurs. Students
from the former year are still involved in the drafting of legal checkings.

  With regard to legal design, the project is interesting as it follows some
clear design patterns:

–– A recognisable yellow colour,
–– A recognisable logo,
–– Yellow highlighting of a tag to show the problematic political state-

  ment according to the existing legal framework,
–– Yellowing of a picture of the politician whose statement is highlighted

  but only showing the underpart of his face (mouth) without the eyes,
–– The structure of the articles is made more readable (title – summary

  – short text),
–– Language is used that is accessible to the general public.

  All these elements were crafted at the project’s onset, though some
underwent subsequent adjustments, occasionally tailored to embody a
more ‘sophisticated’ or ‘professional’ aesthetic characteristic of a me-
dia website. Consequently, the design of Les Surligneurs distinctly aligns
with the ethos of the legal design movement.

  However, when designing the concept, Vincent Couronne and Joachim
Savin were not aware of a specific movement around law and design.
402  V. Couronne, J. Savin, M.S. de Clippele and A. Le Gall

They started with the conviction that in order to bring the law into the
public debate more, it needed to be accessible to non-lawyers and this
needed to be done in an attractive way. It was only a year or two later,
in 2018-2019, that the legal design movement really emerged in France.

2.2. Beyond Design Thinking: Les Surligneurs as a Mix of “Meaning Driven
Design” and “Projective Design”

The project Les Surligneurs, from its inception, did not follow the canon-
ical approach to legal design, centred on design thinking, i.e. “a process”
aimed at “formulating a ‘problem” from a user’s point of view and trying
to solve it by creating desirable, viable and feasible experiences”.7

  In contrast to this multidisciplinary and user-centred approach of le-
gal design thinking, Les Surligneurs has followed a different path. The
project started in the mind of the designer and the lawyer, following
their intention to highlight legal texts and their application to nourish
the public debate.

  In that respect, they elaborated what might be qualified as a “Meaning
Driven Design”, i.e. a traditional “art-based” design approach, where the
intent of the designer – a new vision of the political and public debate
scenery – was to create new meanings, without necessarily consulting
the users beforehand.8 Les Surligneurs could also qualify as “Informa-
tion Design”, which aims to visualise information following several crite-
ria: accuracy, simplicity and clarity, as theorised, among others, by Per
Mollerup.9

  Moreover, Les Surligneurs also aimed to create and formalise devices
“in order to spark debate” following a more critical design approach –
the yellow highlighting of politicians making legally problematic state-
ments was designed to be visible enough to critically react to such

statements.10 This is what Apolline Le Gall and Sumi Saint-Auguste called
a “Projective Design”.11

  Together with “Research-Design”,12 the Meaning Driven Design and
the Projective Design constitute other spaces of legal design, besides the
predominant Legal Design Thinking. Le Gall and Saint-Auguste drafted
these four spaces of design practice, allowing for embracing “a broader
comprehension of design, acknowledging its diversity of practices” and
thereby drawing a design theory that is much more in line with design-
erly thinking than the only ‘design thinking’.13

  Other authors have also gone beyond legal design thinking to wel-
come legal design. Margaret Hagan insists on the fact that applying de-
sign to law is not only about the visual aspect of law, nor only about
information being better designed; it could embrace product design,
service design and organisation design. For her, “Legal design is the ap-
plication of human-centered design to the world of law, to make legal
systems and services more human-centered, usable, and satisfying”.14
This includes not only creating better front-ends and back-ends to the
legal system, thereby helping the lay person and the legal profession, but
also improving the design of the actual legal system, through incremen-
tal and breakthrough changes.15 Les Surligneurs fits Hagan’s purposes
of better communication (“to communicate information – particularly
complex legal information – in a clearer, more compelling, and more us-
able way”) and of new products and services. As mentioned before, Les
Surligneurs generates ideas of how to use the law in the public debate
and improve it if need be.

  Certainly, Les Surligneurs serves as a conduit for citizens to access
authenticated, understandable information regarding legal matters un-
der discussion in the public sphere (featured in headlines across media

outlets, contentious subjects, etc.). This remains the primary objective
that the project has steadfastly pursued: to communicate a lucid and
approachable explanation of the existing legal framework. In the case
of Les Surligneurs, legal design holds significance in engaging the public,
stimulating the interest in participating in public discourse about policy
decisions or broader political conversations. It transcends a mere sim-
plification of the law; it encompasses an educational aspect, aiming to
impart legal knowledge to the public. For these reasons, the project sur-
passes certain inherent limitations associated with legal design, as out-
lined in the next chapter.

3. Legal Design Limitations

Les Surligneurs serves as an interesting example of a design project with-
in the legal sphere, which is different from legal design projects, thereby
surpassing certain constraints within legal design and offering solutions
to overcome them. It exceeds four particular limitations commonly asso-
ciated with legal design (2.1). These limitations can be understood in the
context of design thinking (2.2).

3.1. Four Limitations to Legal Design

3.1.1. Cultural Timidity: Hiding Design Production
The first limitation that struck us was the disproportion between the dis-
courses (oral and written) held about legal design qualities and the lack
of physical evidence of such achievements. In other words, we hear a lot
about legal design but we do not see that much of it. However, from the
design point of view, legitimacy is built precisely by being able to show
and display projects. The presentation of the production and its criticism
by teachers and peers is constitutive evidence of the training and the
future professional culture of the practitioner.16

  Thus, a designer’s worth lies in what s/he does, not what s/he says.
Even if discourse has taken an important place in some recent practices

A Critical Assessment of the Notion of Legal Design...  405

(discursive design, fiction design...), a discourse relies on artifacts, ma-
terial elements that are the support for the discourse or the narrative.17
Of course, nowadays there are several counter-examples of famous de-
signers who talk more than they design (or make their teams design for
them), and some of these writings and speeches obviously contribute to
the structure of the discipline (Raymond Loewy, Ettore Sottsass, Bruno
Munari, Kenya Hara…). Nevertheless, for every design professional, the
extent of their competence is measured by the object they create or its
representation in photo or video.

  Yet, since the first appearance of the term legal design in France, i.e.,
10 years ago, there have been almost no images available to portray the
works done, apart from the legal design community initiative by Ubisoft.
A search on the internet mainly reveals diagrams inspired by those of
Margaret Hagan or methodological representations inspired by design
thinking.

  Legal design practitioners frequently cite the confidentiality clause
as the rationale behind this phenomenon. This explanation is not sat-
isfactory; there are methods to anonymize or conceal elements with-
out compromising “business secrecy”. Notably, various French ministries
or governmental agencies, such as the Direction de l’information légale
et administrative (DILA, the Directorate for legal and administrative in-
formation) and Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés
(CNIL, the National Commission on computing and liberties), have availed
themselves of such services, yet traces of this work are seldom found.

  Our assumption revolves around a conflict between two professional
cultures, where legal experts tend to refrain from showcasing their work.
This hesitation may stem from apprehensions about “failure” and poten-

     tuelle (agonisme) et d’expression des voix marginales (dissensus)’ (phdthesis, Uni-

tial criticism.18 Additionally, their primary mode of communication leans
towards text rather than visuals, contributing to this reluctance.19

  In contrast to the cultural timidity and the emphasis placed on discuss-
ing legal design rather than the actual designed outcome, Les Surligneurs
took a different approach by promptly introducing a tangible product: a
website with recognisable design features. Essentially, as a public plat-
form, Les Surligneurs inherently surpasses this initial limitation. Yet, its
founders encountered internal debates concerning the editorial direc-
tion and making the analytical work visible at a ‘non-academic’ level.
Convincing law professors, who typically have low visibility in the media,
to participate in this project was crucial, leading to the need for visual
and editorial compromises that satisfied all of the parties involved.

3.1.2. Methodological Rigidity: The User as the Only Goal
The second critique of French legal design centres on its methodological
inflexibility, primarily relying on the almost exclusive use of the user-cen-
tred approach. This limitation becomes more pressing when considering
the evolution of Design over time—a progression that has diversified
the discipline, gradually freeing it from its original domains of industrial
and graphic design. This expansion, described by Chanal, Le Gall, and
Irrmann as the “extension of the fields of Design”,20 has notably spurred
designers’ interest in new realms of application and markets. This shift
has also attracted new disciplines and practitioners intrigued by the im-
pact of design within their respective fields, such as the service industry,
digital engineering, public services, the medical sector, and prospective
design. Consequently, this evolution has fuelled the emergence of de-
sign thinking.

  In the subsequent section, we will delve into the dearth of knowledge
and historical references, constituting the third limitation we aim to ex-
plore. Our objective is to emphasise that the current practice of legal
design in France only captures a fraction of the practices and approaches
inherited from design thinking. Le Gall’s article further explores these
facets in greater detail.21

  The methodological rigidity generates a particular effect: it curtails the
transformative potential of accomplishments, a point highlighted by Don
Norman and Roberto Verganti.22 The prevalent use of user-centred ap-
proaches tends to foster incremental advancements rather than radical
innovations. In essence, it leads to enhancements in the existing situa-
tion without scrutinising the underlying problems or the flawed frame-
work itself. There is improvement, but the fundamental aspects remain
unchanged.

  This specific limitation, when coupled with the first one, provokes cer-
tain repercussions: the standardised approach yields minimal alterations
at the core, and significant changes are either minimal or concealed.
Consequently, the representation of legal design, both internally (among
actors) and externally (among sponsors), remains confined to standard-
ised methodologies, limiting innovative strides and broader visibility.

  To get back to Les Surligneurs, the project is not (only) user-centred,
unlike most legal design initiatives. It is a mix of “Meaning Driven De-
sign” and “Projective Design”. However, this mix was unintentional when
it was created by the founders; it came out as something outside of their
respective fields of expertise. Following that approach, real innovation
was possible when developing the product.

3.1.3. Notional Blur: Cut Off from Its Historical Roots
The third limitation, although it partly accounts for the methodological
rigidity we just discussed, has been segregated deliberately. This segre-
gation is essential as one limitation is contingent upon the examination
of the other, leading to specific consequences.

  As previously mentioned, Design as a discipline boasts its own auton-
omy and historical trajectory, dating back to the late 19th century. How-
ever, in the domain of legal design, a notable absence exists regarding
references to its historical evolution and the concepts formulated by ear-
lier professionals and theorists. Consequently, a variety of terminologies
emerge from disparate spheres: terms like plain language, behavioural
sciences, infographics, customer acquisition, and legal tech find com-
mon ground with terms borrowed from user-centred design and graphic
design, such as UX/UI, user journey, and prototype. Strikingly absent are
terms directly tied to the original practices of service design, like sketch,
scale model, touchpoints, or references.

  To illuminate the diverse “threads” interwoven within the contempo-
rary legal landscape, we propose applying Verganti’s framework.23 This
application aims to disentangle the conventional innovation approaches
from the technical, marketing, and user-centric approaches. While the
complete implementation of this framework remains a work in progress,
we anticipate that it will, at the very least, help delineate the unique ex-
pertise inherent in each field. This delineation, in turn, will ideally clarify
the trends driving legal innovation.

     Radically Innovating What Things Mean (Harvard Business Review Press 2009).
A Critical Assessment of the Notion of Legal Design...  409

  The novelty of legal design as a practice does not inherently clarify
the prevalent sense of amateurism or unfamiliarity observed in its uti-
lisation of Design’s intellectual and methodological tools. This becomes
even more perplexing considering the clearly defined potential impacts
of legal design, which owe much to the foundational work of Margaret
Hagan.

  This “notional blur” becomes especially paradoxical when wielded by
professionals in an intensely specialised discipline characterised by en-
closed domains that mandate adherence to established rules. It is some-
what ironic that lawyers, known for their specific attachment to the
notion of “jurisdiction”, end up challenging the “jurisdiction” in terms
of the professional territory wielded by designers.24 By contrast, Les Sur-
ligneurs has avoided conceptual ambiguity by relying from the start on
specific design concepts especially in graphic, web and service design.

  Our premise suggests that this situation arises from both the nature of
the individuals involved and the professional and academic landscape of
Design in France. On the one side, the majority of actors in legal design
are lawyers, who naturally lack the broad references typically acquired
through comprehensive training, which can span up to five years. Al-
though some have either hired trained designers for specific tasks or
pursued supplementary training, often resulting in shorter degrees, this
remains limited.

  On the other side, from an academic standpoint, Design lacks a robust
structure in France. There is a notable absence of a unified university
section dedicated to the discipline. Historically, collective representa-
tion, associations, and unions within the design realm have been weak.
These entities encompass only a fraction of the design professionals due
to various specialised statuses (for instance, graphic designers can join
the Maison des Artistes, while the same is not applicable for industrial
designers). Additionally, the individualistic culture prevalent among de-
signers further contributes to this fragmentation.

  Consequently, the lack of robust professional representation and the
absence of an established legal design culture, combined with the dis-
regard for the design profession, as noted by Rae Morgan and Emily

24 Claude Dubar, Pierre Tripier and Valérie Boussard, Sociologie des professions (3e
     éd, A Colin 2011).
410  V. Couronne, J. Savin, M.S. de Clippele and A. Le Gall

Allbon,25 perpetuate the conceptual ambiguity that undermines the
credibility of this field.

3.1.4. Political Scope: Little to No Political Commitment
Concerning the various legal design initiatives in France, few prioritise or
embody symbolic or political values. Discounting student or associative
projects, the predominant showcase revolves around enhancing exist-
ing practices, neglecting to re-evaluate the significance and influence
of law itself. Notably, nondisclosure agreements, corporate contracts,
compliance measures, and organisational processes form the bulk of the
accomplishments. However, the subject matter being manipulated is in-
herently political, governing the lives of both the city and its citizens.

  While Design encounters its internal contradictions between the hu-
manistic ideals it upholds and the consumption-driven society fostering
its growth,26 self-reflection remains pivotal. From William Morris to De-
signers éthiques, professionals have frequently interrogated their role
in production and assumed political stances. Consequently, while not all
designers today are politicised, they acknowledge the profound political
implications intrinsic to their profession and practice. This is clear to the
legal-checking project Les Surligneurs, which questions the law by some-
times going beyond mere checking - taking political assertions seriously
- within the limits of the rule of law. Therefore, it critically assesses the
law, and has a clear political scope, unlike other legal design projects.

  In the current democratic climate, engaging with the law could have
served as a potent avenue for advocacy, empowering collectives and in-
dividuals, and prompting scrutiny of institutions and legal frameworks.
Yet, beyond seeking operational efficiency or, at best, ensuring consumer
rights, it appears that legal design, rooted in a commercial context as a
professional practice, only partially realises its concealed potential.

  This limitation appears to stem not only from the absence of a critical
historical consciousness among professionals and the methodological
dominance of the user-centred approach, which constrains the concep-
tion process to the individual. It also seems to be connected to the man-
ner in which legal design was introduced in France.

 4. Limitations in the Context of Design Thinking and of the French En-
 vironment

 In this section, our aim is to elucidate the emergence of these limitations
 by examining the almost epistemological connection between design
 and legal design via the framework of design thinking. Additionally, we
 will contextualise this connection within the local setting by providing a
 historical overview of its application.

 4.1. The Design Thinking Heritage

 This part revolves around the third and fourth limitations (methodologi-
 cal rigidity and political stakes). We believe that a big portion of the lim-
 itations we identified could be directly attributable to the direct filiation
 between legal design and design thinking.

    Made popular by Tim Brown, one of the founders of the consulting
 agency IDEO, design thinking is a method inspired by the work and way
 of thinking of designers: It puts emphasis on the conception and design
 process and starts from a close comprehension of the user to develop a
 prototype and test solutions.27 In its model, design thinking is a method
 that aims to develop a universal design method, which companies could
 seize upon. This approach by method, reproduced in legal design, is con-
 trary to the logic-based approach that is proper to design, as defined by
 Stéphane Vial:28

“1. Design is a project discipline as well as architecture and engineering.
 2. Design is a project discipline based on a specific creative culture,

     which is not reducible to that of architecture, the decorative arts, en-
     gineering or marketing [...]
 3. Design is a project discipline with its own mode of knowledge or un-
     derstanding through which it contributes to the contemporary epis-

     Inspires Innovation (HarperBusiness 2009).

   teme [...] it is not only a way to design and build artifacts but also,
   through them, a way of knowing and understanding the world [...]
4. Design is a project discipline that is philosophically committed to an
   ideal for a better and sustainable future, whose goal is to improve the
   ‘inhabitability of the world’29 [...]
5. Design is a discipline of project in progress in which the concept of
   project changes over time [...]”

  This definition offers a favourable perspective on the earlier critiques:
design is politically engaged (point 4), and its procedural methodology
is continually advancing (point 5). Regarding this latter point, it is worth
noting that designers are simultaneously progressing in terms of prob-
lem identification and solution formulation, engaging in a form of ab-
ductive reasoning: “Abductive reasoning is “in opposition to deductive
(from the general to the specific) and inductive (from the specific to the
general) reasoning… [it is a] ‘logical leap of the mind’ or an ‘inference to
the best explanation’ to imagine a heuristic for understanding the mys-
tery”.30

  Certainly, Schön illustrates that the practical execution of design hinges
on a dynamic “conversation” between the designer and the context.31
Some scholars even characterise “design as a conversation”: the design
proposition forms a middle ground between the designer’s perspective,
the viewpoint and objectives of the commissioning organisation, the in-
tended users of the “object”, and the various constraints (legal, techni-
cal, economic, etc.) that govern its creation.

  The introduction of design thinking among novices highlights the cru-
cial requirement for a successful project: the team’s adeptness in han-

dling ambiguity—a challenging stance to adopt.32 Consequently, the
most effective groups in design thinking are those that do not adhere
strictly to a sequential approach but continuously engage in “problem
framing” exercises throughout the project.33

     Ultimately, achieving success in a project rooted in design thinking
     methods necessitates a certain detachment—a reflexive approach or,
     in simpler terms, an understanding of design as a process with its uni-
     que culture, reasoning, and practices.34

  The teaching of design (as long as it is done several times, and taken
with reflexivity) allows for experimenting with a succession of activities
to make design decisions in the unknown and understand when one
must hold back its judgement to move forward and know when to di-
verge and converge35. Design practices can thus navigate fluidly between
the formulation of a design situation and the formalisation of innovative
proposals, as Lawson has shown.36 In other words, the problem and the
solution are developed simultaneously, and that can look counterpro-
ductive for professionals who learned to first frame the problem and
only then search for solutions and for those whose fields of knowledge
are impermeable.

  To better illustrate this process, Nigel Cross explains that the thinking
in design is based on an emergency phenomenon, i.e., based on relevant
characteristics that emerge from attempted solutions, which were not

     tolerance for, and ways of working through, this ambiguity”, Victor P Seidel and

     needfinding in concept selection”, ibid.

     ing in which it is not the adoption of individual methods themselves, but the early
     use of the methods in a reflexive manner that leads to successful innovation”, ibid.

formally expressed in the problem formulation in the first place.37 It is a
way of reasoning oriented to the making and production of material ob-
jects in order to avoid procrastination in the face of the immensity and
variety of information needed to approach a complex problem. In other
words, one can act before thinking, one can - and even must - act to
think. This is what Schön describes with the concept of the professional
as a reflective practitioner who constantly thinks in and about the situ-
ation and can thus exercise his own creativity.38 That is something that
lawyers find difficult to accept because often their profession (especially
in the liberal or private sector) consists precisely of “risk management”
and “documenting before acting”, which is also related to the first limi-
tation, cultural timidity.

  When it comes to political engagement, regarding the problematisa-
tion of the user’s “pain points”, legal design reproduces an individualistic
(a user) and utilitarian (a problem) view from design thinking and inev-
itably encloses its projects in a limited horizon, without thought about
“what’s desirable”, when other design approaches allow for better ques-
tioning the core/sense of things,39 systems,40 and the desirability of pos-
sible futures.41

  More widely speaking, for Banathy, the genesis of a design process
relies on the fact that one either wishes to, or must, change a system or
create a new one. It is a matter of going beyond the current state of the
environment, of going beyond what exists and allowing the framework
for the creative and the new to exist.42 It is the transcendence of the
existing situation that allows individuals to contemplate the field of pos-
sibilities and opportunities, such that the interpretation and problemati-
sation of the existing situation is the first step in defining and structuring

the problem of the future service. It is from this first phase of transcend-
ence that a phase of imagination and exploration of possibilities begins.43

  By turning Design into a method, design thinking follows the general
movement of economics and companies of not being politically inclined,
but like it or not, Design is a political activity, for by definition it is a pre-
scribed activity: “designers may be seen to prescribe and to create the
future”.44

4.2. Specificities in the French Context

This section refers in particular to limits 1 (cultural timidity) and 3 (no-
tional blur). In this section we will rely mostly on observations and en-
counters that took place at professional legal design events in France
and our experience at “Lab Legal”, which is the professional association
that unites the actors of legal design in France today in view of the na-
tional salon dedicated to legal innovation. We also count with different
documentary searches to try to retrace the conditions of appearance
and diffusion of this practice in a synthetic and inevitably non-exhaustive
way.

  While the term “legal design” initially emerged in the US in 2013, its
introduction to France occurred in 2015 through a publication by CNIL’s
prospective unit, LINC. Geoffrey Delcroix, was the leader of this unit, be-
fore being Head of Legal Innovation at Ubisoft in 2020. This initial publi-
cation, co-authored with Mylène Podvin during her time as a student at
ENSCI, mapped initiatives linked to privacy design and legal design but
did not directly reference Margaret Hagan. Another mention of the term
appeared in an interview with Miroslav Kurdov and an article profiling
Olivia Zarcate, a legal expert and founder of Imagidroit, but both omitted
the perspective of design thinking, thus diverging from Margaret Hagan’s
interpretation of legal design. The CNIL holds significance in this history,
primarily due to its influence in the realm of legal innovation.

  The term gradually gained traction within professional associations,
notably through ThinkLeD from OpenLaw, an influential association ad-

vocating open innovations in the legal sphere, and the establishment of
Assas Legal Innovation within a major French law school. Concurrently,

com, and Marie Potel-Saville, who later became the French ambassa-
dor for Finnish legal design company Dot in 2018 before founding her
agency, Amurabi, displayed an interest in the subject.

  Subsequently, the term began to surface in articles from major French
legal publishers like Francis Lefebvre and Lefebvre-Sarrut. Sumi Saint-Au-
guste, then co-president of Open Law, supervised the R&D department,
contributing to this increased exposure. The year 2018 witnessed a
surge in interest from various entities, including the Maison du Barreau
de Paris and an association of young legal professionals in corporations,
leading to a rise in mentions of, and conferences on legal design.

  In 2019, the third national salon dedicated to legal design expanded
its programme to involve legal design actors in conferences and work-
shops. Concurrently, the Ecole Française des Barreaux, France’s largest
lawyer training school, introduced mandatory training modules on legal
innovation, including a dedicated module on legal design.

  Finally, in late 2019, multiple French legal design actors, including
some of those previously mentioned, united within a professional asso-
ciation named Lab Legal, whose statutes were submitted in 2020. By Oc-
tober of the same year, the fourth legal design salon had been renamed
Rendez-vous de la Transformation du Droit, signalling a certain maturity
in approach towards various legal innovation actors, with a dedicated
space and extensive programming for legal design.

  This historical overview is only partial but it allows us to make an obser-
vation: aside from CNIL, the promotion of legal design in France is done
essentially in private, particularly through lawyers, legal experts, com-
panies’ lawyers, and major legal publishers with structures dedicated to
innovation. That means that in France, legal design has been promoted
by individuals with little knowledge of Design and with a working cul-
ture that is not very consistent with the project and its presentation.
Moreover, this emergence took place in a context of technological and
commercial competition, driven by the legal tech sector, quite far from

5. Design of the Public Debate and the Fight Against Dis- and Misinfor-
mation Through Better Access to Information

5.1. Politics and the Law are More and More Complex

Politics and the law are becoming more and more complex, due to the
complexification of global issues (climate, refugees, economy, terrorism,
etc.). In 2015, the former President of the European Commission Jean-
Claude Juncker declared that Europe was in the midst of a “polycrisis”.45
The situation is no better today, as historian Adam Tooze said in 2022.46
Tooze underlines many of the stresses the world faces today, to which
he adds the risk of nuclear escalation, inflation, shortages, the possible
return of a Trumpist president in the US and many others. This analy-
sis considers the fact that the current crises come with highly techni-
cal issues. Climate change makes us deal with carbon footprint, quotas,
chemical substances, new kinds of taxations and social conflicts.

  Inevitably, the law designed to address these crises is becoming more
and more complex. In 2003, texts containing 1.87 million signatures
were published in the French Official journal. In 2013, it was 3.2 million.
In the last 20 years, the number of legislative acts has grown by 73%,
and the number of decrees by 53%, according to a study by the French
Government.47 Their length has increased at the same time.

  In addition, the levels of government of becoming more complex.
Decentralisation gives more powers to local governments; the build-
ing of the European Union makes it possible for more institutions to
pass legislation and regulations. This situation makes it more difficult
for journalists, politicians and, of course, citizens, to be able to ask for
accountability. Les Surligneurs had to publish articles to tackle the idea
according to which France’s pensions reform is a requirement from the
European Union.48 From a legal point of view, the political majority in
France since 2017 is the one pushing for the pensions reform, not the
European Union, and Les Surligneurs has given evidence of this.

  But who can blame the citizens? The making of the law has become
so complex that it is almost impossible to know who is accountable for
which reform unless you are an expert. François Ost and Michel van de
Kerchove pointed out the slow change from a pyramid of norms to a
network of norms involving governance instead of government.49 It is
no surprise that conspiracy theories are so popular nowadays since they
allow a simplistic explanation to a complex issue.

5.2. A Paradox: It’s Getting Harder to Find Reliable Sources

In the meantime, citizens, who are also voters, struggle more and more
in finding intelligible information. Of course, access to information is
meant to be easier thanks to digital platforms and search engines, but
the proliferation of websites and sources has created a digital mess. The
results of an online search are not based on how reliable the website is,
but on other factors that eventually have to fulfil one of the search en-
gine’s goals: being profitable.50 Hence, when searching the EU directive

on posted workers on the Google search engine, the EU official website
eur-lex.eu does not necessarily come among the first results.

  Some remarkable efforts have been made in these last years in France
with official websites such as vie-publique.fr and service-public.fr. But
these efforts are far from being sufficient to make sure that citizens can
access reliable information, in a country where 17% of the population
suffer from digital illiteracy.

  Indeed, it seems that the business model of online platforms relies
too much on getting more and more personal data, and therefore they
are not able to make sure that the information that is displayed is relia-
ble. Shoshana Zuboff shows how what she calls “radical indifference”51
has shaped the algorithmic models of online platforms. She recalls this
memo that Andrew Bosworth, then one of the top directors of Face-
book and now president of Meta Virtual Reality, shared with his teams
in 2016, in which he declared about Facebook that “Maybe it costs a life
by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack
coordinated on our tools [...] The ugly truth is that we believe in con-
necting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more
people more often is *de facto* good”.52

  We know to what extent the attention economy has been instrumen-
tal to the growth of online platforms.53 There is more and more evi-
dence that disinformation is used to make the attention economy more
efficient,54 making disinformation part of the business model of online
platforms, and eventually weakening the trust of citizens in democratic
institutions. In this context, the work of actors such as law teachers and
designers is crucial.

5.3. Where Are the Law Teachers and the Legal Designers?

The difficulty of finding intelligible information is deepened by the polar-
isation of the debate and the massification of information sources (social
networks, search engines, notifications, etc.). At the same time, lawyers
and legal scholars, who can contribute to or enlighten the public de-
bate, are scarcely heard in the public debate in France. In 1912, 30% of
the members of the National Assembly were also lawyers. The number
dropped to 5% in 1997.55 Indeed, after the Second World War, law pro-
fessors and lawyers were replaced by spin doctors and high ranking civil
servants who studied political science or other disciplines, for example
at the National School of Administration.56 As a consequence, law pro-
fessors and lawyers, who are not involved in the making of the law as
they were before, tend to lose the skills to communicate the substance
of the law to the public.

  Legal designers are also usually absent from the political stage, as was
previously shown in this paper.57 Designers can be found in France in
two public instances: first, in public administrations where they work on
websites such as service-public.fr or vie-publique.fr; and second, in pub-
lic innovation, under the leadership of the Direction interministérielle à
la transformation publique, a department of the public modernisation
ministry. Interestingly, there are no legal designers in these two services.

     Paul Markus, ‘Legal Checking. L’expérience Des Surligneurs’ – SIEJ (10/05/2022) (Di-
     rected by SIEJ, 2022) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro3IoysBu1s> accessed
A Critical Assessment of the Notion of Legal Design...  421

members of Les Surligneurs realised that the exercise was not that evi-
dent: proving that a statement is wrong by referring to an existing legal
norm assumes that the law is clear in itself. But that is not always the
case; the law itself is rarely black or white, and its application often de-
pends on the single case and how you put things forward.59 Therefore,
the tags used to do a legal-check of the political statements sometimes
become more nuanced (not simply ‘wrong’ or ‘illegal’ but ‘problematic’,
‘difficult’, ‘misleading’ or ‘to be nuanced’) indicating that the exercise is
more complex. As a matter of fact, the law often travels in grey zones
and providing a clear and accessible information of the current legal
framework is more challenging than it seems. Moreover, the law may
change and so what is considered illegal today might not be so tomor-
row or vice-versa. Contributors to Les Surligneurs have therefore slowly
switched their approach: it is not only about referring to the current le-
gal texts to check a political statement but also about taking some state-
ments seriously and examining how one statement would impact the
existing legal framework if it were to be implemented. For instance, if
Marine Le Pen (leader of a right wing party) were to declare that France
was going to quit the energy market of the European Union, it could
not be done according to the current legal framework, unless France left
or modified the European Treaties. A political statement could however
only be taken seriously if it fitted with the rule of law; that is the limit
beyond which to legal-check politicians. This implies that the notion of
rule of law is clear enough, which might also not be the case.60

  The experience of Les Surligneurs also reveals other hurdles.61 First,
legal-checking should not be perceived as censoring: the political state-
ment should not be overinterpreted or taken too literally, or even taken
seriously when it was meant as a touch of humour. Politicians often use

     uity in the application of the law: Jérémie Van Meerbeeck, ‘Penser par cas… Et par
     principes’ (2014) 73 Revue interdisciplinaire d’études juridiques 77.

     in the public space, where everything then risks being dominated by the powerful,

registers other than rational law-centred phrasings and resort to emo-
tions, symbols, philosophy, history and so on. For instance, when Paul
Magnette, the president of the Socialist Party in the French-speaking
community of Belgium, said that the liberal party’s suggested measures
for unemployment amount to forced labour and was therefore high-
lighted by Les Surligneurs as “excessive”, he mentioned the following in
his right of reply: “It’s the entire difference between legal language and
political expression, which is always made up of metaphors”.62

  Second, the articles might not be read, and thereby fail to participate,
in the public debate. To avoid that risk, the editing focuses on staying
concise, and avoiding legal jargon, as well as any sensationalism, arro-
gance, or simplism. Concerning the lectorate, about one third are law-
yers and two thirds are journalists.63 It remains difficult to reach the
broader public and involve the layman citizen.

  Third, one of the biggest hurdles is not being, or even not being per-
ceived as, partial. When legal-checking political statements, there is an
inherent subjective component to that exercise (the selection of the
statement – not too much from one political party or movement – and
the drafting of the checking), which should be as neutral as possible. To
escape any political labelling, Les Surligneurs follows two bodies of de-
ontological rules:
–– academic deontology requires remaining independent and not

  subjecting these checking techniques to your own political opinions
  as well as going further than checking the current legal framework and
  going up in the hierarchy of norms;
–– journalistic deontology requires abiding by a deontological code (al-
  lowing a right of reply…).

  Fourth, even if the articles should remain concise and accessible,
they may not contain any errors. There may be inaccuracies, which can

     travail forcé”, assène Paul Magnette’ (Les Surligneurs, 23 November 2021) <https://

63 According to an impact survey in January 2023, available at <https://survey.im-

A Critical Assessment of the Notion of Legal Design...  423

be dealt with by using terms such as “in principle” or “notably”, but it
should not be more than that. To avoid errors, all articles are reviewed
by experts in the Editing Committee or outside experts if the topic is
not in the area of expertise of the Editing Committee, and always by the
Editing Director. If the law is not clear enough, the Editing Director, Jean-
Paul Markus, decides to withhold publication, as legal-checking does not
have the aim of producing a new legal doctrine on a certain controversy.

  Fifth, it may be that some citizens disagree with the law that is be-
ing checked and that the legal checking operation sparks a more funda-
mental debate. To some, the law only represents the established order
of the powerful. They reject the rule of law, i.e. the current system of
democratic values, and vote for more extremist, antidemocratic political
leaders or call for civil disobedience.64 If the political project were then
to change, the law should be adapted too, but it might be contrary to the
democratic values. Les Surligneurs clearly defends the rule of law (l’État
de droit), and not simply the current legal framework (l’état du droit).
This is where the role of Les Surligneurs comes close to a “Projective De-
sign” and aims to take part in that broader debate: to change society by
reducing disinformation and to ensure better respect for the rule of law.

  Lastly, concerning the design aspect of Les Surligneurs, it seems to
keep up its promises: with its very recognisable features (yellow colour,
highlighting, tags…) the website and its content have gained recognition
over time, becoming a valued media outlet among other professionals
(journalists, lawyers…). Les Surligneurs (France and Belgique) together
with Datagora, an anti-fake news platform focused on the design of
statistics, received a grant from the Organisation internationale de la
Francophonie (OIF) to share knowledge on the fight against disinforma-
tion, to build capacity on fact-checking and to draft a white book.65 They

held workshops in 2022 on Communication Strategy, Information Design
and Fact-Checking. It was confirmed that the design strategy of Les Sur-
ligneurs was on point with a clear and coherent visual identity, with in-
novative tools (podcasts, quizzes, webinars, legalthons…), with widening
partnerships and with a certain presence on social media.

Conclusion

The limitations of the legal design initiatives in France are the result of
history and of the approach of those who introduced legal design: cul-
tural shyness, methodological rigidity, notional blur, and little political
commitment. The example of Les Surligneurs shows how it is possible to
go beyond these limitations, because the project was founded and led
by a lawyer and a designer. Les Surligneurs also shows that legal design
should not be made by non-designers who only apply a method. It takes
both designers and lawyers to build projects that can go beyond the lim-
itations of legal design.

  There are different ways of doing legal design, and there are also vari-
ous effects of legal design. In the case of Les Surligneurs, the effects can
be seen on the public debate. But some effects are limited. Those par-
ticipating in Les Surligneurs have reached some of these limitations: the
design of public debate – the polarisation of public debate, the growing
complexity of the law – makes it difficult to reach out to the public. Also,
it remains a challenge to find enough law professors who are willing to
participate in the public debate.

  Other effects have been unexpected. The most interesting one is that
by running Les Surligneurs, lawyers have come to a new comprehension
of the public debate, as well as a new awareness of society’s issues. Also,
Les Surligneurs questions the role of lawyers in the public debate, and
helps to train law students – those who participate in the project – and
they have developed a tailor-made service for journalists in legal issues
pertaining to the public debate. When combining law and design in the
political sphere, many unexpected opportunities emerge.

HOW CAN DESIGN-DRIVEN INNOVATION AND
NEURODESIGN HELP FIGHTING AGAINST
DECEPTIVE DESIGN

Marie Potel-Saville

Abstract
Dark patterns are deceptive or manipulative interfaces that modify users’ architec-
ture of choice, leading them to act without realising, against their preferences or
against their best interests. They are widely spread in the digital environment and
there is multi-disciplinary evidence of the individual and structural harms they cause.
In this article, we synthesise evidence of the prevalence of dark patterns, evidence
of harms and the legal framework. Then, we propose a complementary area of re-
search to contribute to solving the issue: we introduce the concept of fair patterns,
as a combination of design-driven innovation and neurodesign, building on the hu-
man-centric approach, ‘light patterns’, ‘bright patterns’ without paternalism, auton-
omy preserving protection measures and the newly introduced principle of fairness
by design. Beyond the concept, we also propose a grid of criteria to create fair pat-
terns and provide an example of one of our prototypes. We then discuss whether the
concept of fair patterns is robust enough to contribute to solving the issue, identify
limitations and call for further research, including user testing and a technological
solution to scale fair patterns, in addition to training all of the stakeholders.

1. Introduction

Design thinking certainly does not exhaust the role that design plays in
innovation,1 and has attracted criticism among designers themselves,2

     vation: A Challenging Ride Towards New Possibilities’ in Miriam Grace and George

namely in regard to ‘diluting’ design into a corporate, linear and almost
‘tick-the-box’ (or ‘tick-the-post-it-notes’) process.

  While we still see the value of design thinking in our practice as a start-
ing point, this paper aims at exploring the potential of design-driven in-
novation,3 and NeuroDesign4 in contributing to solving one of the most
widespread issues for humans online: dark patterns.5 In general terms,
dark patterns are interfaces that deceive or manipulate users, to act with-
out realising, against their preferences or against their own interests.

  Dark patterns are now legally defined in the EU by the Digital Services
Act, as interfaces that ‘mislead, manipulate, impair or substantially limit
the ability of users to make free and informed decisions’, due to their
‘design, organization or the way they are operated’.6

  There is also rich scientific literature on the definition and taxonomy
of dark patterns. A behavioural study by the European Commission on
unfair commercial practices online revealed that 97% of European cit-
izens’ preferred e-commerce sites contain at least one dark pattern,7
while a Princeton/Chicago University study analysed over 11,000 favour-
ite e-commerce sites in the US and found 1,818 dark pattern instances,
and even 23 providers offering ‘on the shelf’ dark patterns.8

  Interestingly, scientific literature has been focusing on debating defini-
tions, taxonomies and the regulation of dark patterns, but little has been
published so far on solving the issue, apart from new regulations.9

  This paper aims at exploring whether design-driven innovation, on its
own or combined with NeuroDesign, (which aims at applying the infor-
mation gained by studying brain functioning to improve and advance
design thinking practices10) has the potential to counter dark patterns
and help create ‘fair patterns’: interfaces that empower users to make
enlightened and free choices.

  First, we will present multidisciplinary evidence of the prevalence and
harms caused by dark patterns. Second, we will introduce the concept of
fair patterns, combining design-driven innovation and NeuroDesign. Fi-
nally, we will discuss whether the new concept is robust enough to tackle
the issue and what the limitations are, and call for further research. As a
conclusion, given the significant gaps between human cognitive abilities
and what would be required to truly keep our autonomy online, we call
for legislators to take into account neurosciences and cognitive sciences
in new legislation regulating the digital economy.

2. Multi-Disciplinary Evidence of the Prevalence of, and Harms Caused
by, Dark Patterns

2.1. Rich Literature Defining and Categorising Dark Patterns

There has been rich academic literature on the definitions of dark pat-
terns since the term was coined in 2010 by UX designer and PhD in neu-
rosciences holder, Harry Brignull, referring to ‘tricks used in websites and
apps that make you do things that you didn’t mean to, like buying or

signing up for something’.11 Most definitions include notions of:
1. deception, manipulation, coercion, or exploitation in the design and

   wording of user interfaces,
2. playing on humans’ cognitive biases,
3. leading users to make decisions unknowingly, against their preferenc-

   es or against their best interests.12

  Across the various definitions, Mathur, Kshirsagar and Mayer13 find
that the commonality of dark patterns in the scientific literature is that
they “modify the choice architecture presented to users”. They do so
either by:
–– modifying the set of choices available to users: making some choices

  more burdensome, or less appealing than other choices (usually the
  most privacy protective or the cheapest for the users), or
–– manipulating the information flow to users: making protective infor-
  mation more difficult to find or more difficult to understand or even
  providing false information.14

  Either way, dark patterns exploit cognitive biases and in particular
seek to trigger Kahneman’s ‘System 1’ thinking: automatic, fast, intuitive

decisions with low cognitive effort, rather than ‘System 2’ thinking: de-
liberative, conscious and effortful decision-making.15

  Indeed, neurosciences have established that our brain is a real ‘deci-
sion machine’, from the simplest to the most sophisticated, in particular
the prefrontal cortex, at the front of the brain. To make decisions, two
main types of mental strategies (i.e., connections and neural networks)
have been proposed by psychologist Daniel Kahneman, winner of the
Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002:16
–– System 1: very fast, effective and economical for the brain based on

  heuristics. It works very well, very often, but not always, and
–– System 2: slower, analytical strategies, with cognitive effort. It leads to

  the correct solution but is costly for the brain.

  In addition to these systems, a third system is described nowadays,
System 3, inhibition, which is an arbitration system that precisely inter-
rupts – when necessary – the heuristic system (System 1) to activate that
of the algorithms (System 2).17

  Heuristics and cognitive biases are closely linked to System 1, as they
provide decision guidance in cases of uncertainty. The concept of cog-
nitive bias was introduced in the 1970s by Daniel Kahneman and Amos
Tversky to explain certain irrational decisions in the economic field.18
It was then extended to many other fields: perception, statistics, logic,
causality, social relations, etc.

  A cognitive bias can be described as a ‘mental shortcut’: it is a system-
atic, irrational pattern impacting judgement and decision making. Cogni-
tive biases can lead to more effective actions or faster decisions in some
contexts. They reduce the amount of information to be considered and
simplify the processes of judgment and decision-making.

  They can be classified into 4 categories according to the problems
they help us to address:

     patterns push users to make quick heuristic decisions rather than slow and deliber-
     ate ones; OECD (n 11).

–– In cases of information overload: some biases arise from too much
  information

–– In cases of lack of meaning: some biases arise as the brain needs to
  make sense

–– In cases where there is a need to act fast: most biases gain time and
  resources

–– In cases where we are figuring out what needs to be remembered for
  later: biases relating to memory limits arise.

  More than 180 different cognitive biases are described in the litera-
ture. The issue with cognitive biases is that they are :
–– Based on inputs that are not objectives, decisions then differ from ra-

  tional choices
–– Systematic, replicable and difficult to inhibit
–– ‘Silent’: we can miss factors that influence our decision.

  Cognitive biases act like unconscious errors in thinking and may lead
to inaccurate judgement and irrational interpretations. Dark patterns
rely on several cognitive biases that are implicit to users,19 mostly:
–– Anchoring bias
–– Default effect
–– Framing effect
–– Hyperbolic updating effect
–– Optimistic bias
–– Overchoice

  Given that dark patterns rely on cognitive biases that are implicit, they
are often difficult to avoid for users.20 Therefore, they can be considered
as online manipulation as they deprive users of their capacity for inde-
pendent decision-making.21

  Several studies have examined the ‘efficiency’ of dark patterns,
namely Utz and others, who demonstrated with a representative sam-

ple of users that dark patterns influence users’ consent decisions,22 Graßl
and others, who experimented with dark patterns on cookie banners,23
and Maier and Harr, who analysed users’ awareness and ability to de-
tect them. They reported that most users ‘were moderately aware of
these deceptive techniques, several of which were perceived as sneaky
and dishonest. Respondents further expressed a resigned attitude to-
wards such techniques and primarily blamed businesses for their occur-
rence’.24 Bongard-Blanchy and others established that even when users
are aware of some dark patterns, for example the blatant ‘confirmsham-
ing’ (making users feel bad about declining a proposed ‘option’, usually
to buy, subscribe, or share personal data), they cannot resist it.25

  In addition to being ‘silent’ and difficult to resist, there is multi-discipli-
nary evidence of the high prevalence of dark patterns on a global scale.

2.2. World-Wide Evidence of Prevalence, in Spite of Existing Legal Framework

2.2.1. High Prevalence
Significant research efforts have been made to identify the prevalence
of dark patterns. Very recently, in 2023, the European Commission and

national consumer protection authorities of 23 Member States, Norway
and Iceland,26 screened 399 retail sites offering a wide variety of prod-
ucts, and found that nearly 40% contained at least one dark pattern,
among only three types of dark patterns that were searched, in relation
to consumer protection: fake countdown timers, push & pressure to buy
or subscribe, and hidden information.

  The OECD Report on dark patterns identifies a large number of studies
by researchers, regulatory authorities and consumer protection bodies:
–– In 2022, the European Commission study on dark patterns found that

  97% of 75 popular e-commerce websites and apps in the EU contained
  at least one dark pattern;27
–– Radesky and others28 found that 80% of popular children’s apps con-
  tained at least one manipulative design feature;
–– Gunawan and others29 found that all 105 of the most popular online
  services in the Google Play Store that featured both an app and web-
  site format contained at least one dark pattern;
–– The Chilean consumer protection authority found that 64% of 103 Chi-
  lean e-commerce websites examined featured at least one dark pat-
  tern.30
–– Mathur and others31 identified that 11.1% of around 11 000 popular
  e-commerce websites examined featured dark patterns.
–– The International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network identi-
  fied that 24 % of 1754 e-commerce websites/apps investigated featu-
  red “dark nudges” (ICPEN, 2019);32

  contained at least one dark pattern;

  sciously done.

  While the precise prevalence varies, mostly depending on the method
used to identify them, the breadth and severity of harms caused by dark
patterns has led legislators in the US and the EU to expressly prohibit
dark patterns, in addition to already applicable legislation.

2.2.2. Numerous Applicable Legal Grounds, and New Emerging Legislation
An analysis of the legislative framework in the EU and the US reveals
that even before specific legislation targeting dark patterns, there were
numerous legal backgrounds prohibiting them.

  At the European level, there is a large body of legislation that is al-
ready applicable to dark patterns:

–– In data protection law, the GDPR38 (namely Articles 4, 4, 12 and 25),
  the EDPB draft Guidelines on dark patterns on social networks39 and
  the e-Privacy Directive,40 Article 5(3)

–– In sector-specific law: The E-commerce Directive41 (now amended)
  and the Audiovisual and Media Services Directive,42 as amended, and

–– In competition law, some dark patterns could be qualified as an abuse
  of dominance43 (Art. 102 TFEU).

  In the US, Section 5 of the FTC Act44 prohibits “unfair or deceptive
conduct or practices affecting commerce”. In September 2022, the FTC
published a report on dark patterns and announced enforcement meas-
ures45 following a workshop held in 2021.

  None of these acts takes account of the fact that the human brain is
simply not wired for information overload, which triggers Kahneman’s
System 1 answer: automatic response. That is why some authors con-
sider for example that online consent is irrelevant, and that privacy reg-
ulation should let go of this inefficient mechanism and rather impose
fiduciary duties on companies handling our personal data. 46

  Given the prevalence of dark patterns, which indicates that the exist-
ing legislative framework is not sufficient, new texts have emerged to
expressly prohibit them, as ‘dark patterns’.

  The California Privacy Rights Act, (CPRA), passed in 2020, is considered
to be the first piece of legislation to provide a definition of dark patterns:
‘a user interface designed or manipulated with the substantial effect of
subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision-making, or choice, as
further defined by regulation’.47

  The CPRA provides that ‘consent obtained through dark patterns does
not constitute consent’. Similar amendments to privacy laws have been
introduced in other US states, or are under consideration. Similarly, Can-
ada introduced a bill in 2022, the Digital Charter Implementation Act48
(Bill C-27), to prohibit and invalidate consent obtained through decep-
tion or manipulation. Without expressly mentioning the term, it is con-
sidered to cover dark patterns.49

  In the EU, the Digital Services Act50 lays down the transparency obliga-
tions on online platform providers and defines a dark pattern as a digital
interface that ‘misleads, manipulates, impairs or substantially limits the
ability of users to make free and informed decisions’, due to its ‘design,
organization or the way it is operated’.

  In other words, and according to Point 67 of the preamble to the DSA,
they are mechanisms that cause users to act involuntarily, or to make
undesirable decisions, which may have negative consequences for them.
The DSA is due to come into force by February 2024 at the latest.

  Most of the major recent texts, which have been adopted or are in
the process of being adopted at the time of writing, also prohibit dark
patterns in their respective fields. For example, the Digital Markets Act
includes an ‘anti-circumvention’ provision for the main prohibitions
imposed on gatekeepers, in practice the GAFAMs, notably through ‘in-

terface design’.51 The draft Regulation on artificial intelligence52 also pro-
hibits dark patterns, as artificial intelligence practices contrary to the
values of the European Union. The following artificial intelligence prac-
tices are prohibited:
1. placing on the market, putting into service or using an AI system that

   uses subliminal techniques below the threshold of a person’s aware-
   ness to substantially alter their behaviour in a way that causes or is
   likely to cause physical or psychological harm to that person or to a
   third party;
2. the placing on the market, putting into service or use of an AI sys-
   tem that exploits possible vulnerabilities due to the age or physical or
   mental disability of a given group of persons in order to substantially
   alter the behaviour of a member of that group in a way that causes
   or is likely to cause physical or psychological harm to that person or
   to a third party.

2.3. Multi-Disciplinary Evidence of Individual and Structural Harms

The European Commission’s behavioural study on dark patterns53 recalls
that the harmful consequences for consumers have been widely docu-
mented in recent years: financial losses, impairment of autonomy and
privacy, cognitive burdens, and in some cases mental health impairment
(addictions, etc.), in addition to risks of impairment of competition, re-
duced price transparency and ultimately loss of confidence in markets.

  The study also shows that dark patterns particularly affect vulnerable
consumers: minors, senior people, and less educated people. For exam-
ple, one third of Internet users worldwide are minors,54 who are officially

vulnerable and need greater protection under the GDPR, among other
things.

  Dark patterns generate two main types of harms, which have been
identified in the literature: individual harm and structural harm.

  (i) Individual harm
  Unsurprisingly, it has been evidenced that dark patterns harm individ-
uals’ autonomy:55 they trick users in deciding against their preferences,
deny their choice, or make their choice more difficult. Obviously, dark
patterns also harm consumer welfare by generating a financial loss: they
make users buy more than intended, or pay more for what they wanted
to buy. For example “drip pricing” was evidenced to make users spend
21% more than usual. 56
  In addition, dark patterns create significant privacy harms: they lead
users to share more personal data than intended. For example a survey
on Australian consumers showed than 1 in 4 consumers shared more
personal data owing to dark patterns.57 They have also been evidenced
to create psychological detriment and time loss: they generate frustra-
tion and shame and increase our cognitive burden.58 The European Com-
mission even found that they increase the heart rate, and cause anxiety
and alertness.59

  (ii) Structural harm
  Beyond affecting individuals, dark patterns also weaken or alter com-
petition. They do so by preventing consumers from comparing prices,
locking consumers into recurring subscriptions and hampering switch-
ing. They also affect competition,60 and can enable firms to increase their
sales or the volume of personal data they collect without offering better

services or products. In this respect, dark patterns can give them an un-
due competitive advantage.61

  Concerns have also been voiced that dominant firms could use dark
patterns to neutralise a competitive threat: default settings, nagging or
collecting data to offer services in a way that rivals cannot.62

  To the extent that dark patterns impede consumers’ ability to select
the best firms on the merits of their product offerings, market use of
dark patterns can distort the competitive process as a whole),63 allowing
firms to compete through the “efficiency” of their dark patterns rather
than on merit.

  Dark patterns also lead to less consumer trust and engagement: much
of consumers’ behaviour towards online businesses is based on trust,
which has been defined as expectations that businesses will behave in a
favourable, predictable manner. 64

  Unsurprisingly, many researchers have found that dark patterns alter
consumers’ trust in sites and apps using them. For example almost 50%
of consumers exposed to scarcity and social proof dark patterns on ho-
tel booking sites distrusted these sites as a result.65 See also Maier and

  The harms generated by dark patterns are so serious that it could even
put into question whether a market economy is still the system that pro-
vides the greatest benefits for consumers.70 The lack of trust resulting
from dark patterns may lead consumers to lose faith in markets and mar-
ket forces and disengage.71

  In the US, Maya MacGuineas, chair of the Committee for a Respon-
sible Federal Budget, argued in 2020 that in a well-functioning market,
consumers have the freedom to act in their own self-interest and to
maximise their well-being, “but the new powers of the digital age have
built their model on strategies that undermine the principles that make
capitalism a ‘good deal’ for most people”.72

3. Introducing the Concept of Fair Patterns, as a Combination of Desi-
gn-Driven Innovation and Neurodesign

3.1. Building on Design-Driven Innovation, a Human-Centric Approach and
‘Light Patterns’

Given that some cognitive biases arise from a lack of meaning, where-
as the brain needs to make sense, it is interesting to explore whether
design-driven innovation could contribute to solving the issue. Indeed,

design-driven innovation focuses on products’ or services’ meaning, and
the value created by products or services, including utilitarian, emo-
tional, psychological and socio-cultural values.73 Therefore, ‘design-driv-
en innovation broadens the horizon beyond user-centered design and
balances knowledge about user needs, technological development and
product language’.74

  Through the lenses of design-driven innovation, we can question the
meaning and value for users of cookie banners, online privacy policies
and other online contracts – which are often plagued with dark patterns,
as demonstrated above. The rocket-high levels of blind signing seem to
indicate that their current content and form deprives them of (i) any
meaning and consequently (ii) any value for users,75 who are ‘trained to
accept’. 76 One of the most blatant examples of the absence of any mean-
ing, let alone value, of most online terms is the result of the Europol
experiment conducted in 2015, where users of a public Wi-Fi hotspot
agreed to Terms and Conditions that specified that by agreeing, they
would give up their firstborn child or a beloved pet to use the hotspot.77

  Design-driven innovation is based on Krippendorff’s interpretation
of design as a ‘meaning-making activity’.78 According to Krippendorff,79
‘design is making sense (of things)’, creating products or services that

are ‘understandable and meaningful to someone’. We started explor-
ing how to make sense of privacy policies or compliance programs in
2018,80 first through a human-centric approach, taking into account the
characteristics of the context of use. According to the ISO definition,81
human-centred design implies a design team with multidisciplinary skills
and perspectives, a design based on the context of use (users, tasks and
environments), users’ involvement throughout design and development,
an iterative process, a design addressing the whole user experience and
user-centered evaluation to refine solutions.

  For example, we applied human-centred design in our project with
the CNIL, in which our multi-disciplinary team of designers and lawyers
co-created with underage users in creating their ideal privacy informa-
tion interfaces, which would (i) engage them to read, taking into account
their context of use (ii) empower them to understand data privacy con-
cepts or choices easily, and (iii) empower them to better exercise their
privacy rights.82

  King and Stephan,83 building on Susser 84 and Mathur and others85 ad-
vocate this human-centred approach, placing the ‘individual’s ability to
understand what they are consenting to squarely at the core of what it
means to consent’, to create ‘light patterns’. King and Stephan define
‘light patterns’ as the opposite of dark patterns, a non-coercive design.86
King and Stephan87 warn against ‘false remedies’ to dark patterns where
users are given more checkboxes or buttons, which are meaningless and
fragmented. Instead, they advocate solution mechanisms that are ‘more
substantive, meaningful, and informative’.

  In concrete terms, in relation to data privacy consent, such non-coer-
cive design would translate into:
–– existing consent options in the first place: each option to accept should

  have its equivalent to deny,
–– consent options (accept and deny) being placed with equal prominen-

  ce without favouring one choice over the other,
–– no preselected option,
–– same colour-contrast and size of the accept and decline buttons, and
–– in relation to opting out of data sales,88 strictly equivalent steps and

  options to opt-in and opt-out.89

  Arguably, combined with plain language,90 these design features would
make data privacy information more understandable, which would be an
indispensable starting point to become more meaningful, and perhaps
have some value to users.

  This would be relevant assuming that people make decisions and
agree online in a rational way, through conscious weighing of the costs
and benefits of each choice option. 91 However, a growing number of re-
searchers question the relevance of this ‘rational actor’ theory. Indeed,
there is compelling, multi-disciplinary evidence that most users online
do not make decisions in a rational manner, based on their preferences
and values.92 Rather, they use heuristics, i.e. mental shortcuts, and fall
back on cognitive biases.93

  This leads us to combine design-driven innovation with neurodesign.

3.2. Building on Neurodesign and ‘Bright Patterns’

Auernhammer and Roth94 consider that results from neuroscience re-
search are rarely directly applied to design practice, and explore how the
emerging field of NeuroDesign might bridge this gap. The point of Neu-
roDesign is to ‘effectively and efficiently apply the information gained by
studying brain functioning to the development and teaching of improved
design thinking practices’. While Auernhammer studied NeuroDesign to
enhance design thinking approaches, this paper aims at exploring how
NeuroDesign could go beyond design thinking itself.

  In regard to data privacy, Graßl and others95 identified several factors
that make people apply heuristics in cookie banners:
1. Information asymmetry.
2. Ambiguous language (Relying on Simon’s concept of bounded ration-

   ality,96 i.e. human rationality is limited to the available cognitive re-
   sources and the available time, Acquisti and others consider decision
   making in condition of uncertainty triggers System 1).97
3. Cognitive biases affecting people’s privacy decisions: the status-quo
   bias98 and the salience bias.99

  To fight dark patterns, Graßl and others100 experimented with ‘bright
patterns’, i.e. user interface designs that aim to steer consumers towards
consumer-friendly options through nudges.101 For example, a ‘bright

101 Originally, nudging means influencing the decisions of individuals or groups to-

     wards good choices (as judged by themselves) through minor changes in the choice
     environment without compromising freedom of choice. A prominent example is a
     fly painted on a urinal in a public men’s toilet to prevent urine spillage: Richard
     Thaler and Cass R Sunstein, Nudge: Improving Decisions about Wealth, Health and
     Happiness (rev edn, Penguin Books 2009); Potel-Saville (n 76). If a nudge is used for
     evil, Thaler considers it is no longer ‘nudge’, but rather ‘sludge’ See: Richard Thaler,
     ‘Nudge, not Sludge’ (2018) 361 Science 431.
448                             Marie Potel-Saville

pattern’ would make privacy-friendly options easier to select than pri-
vacy-intrusive options, e.g. through preselected defaults or aesthetic
framing.102 They also experimented with several types of bright patterns
to see whether (i) bright patterns indeed led users to choose the pri-
vacy-friendly option and whether (ii) bright patterns deprived users of
their perceived control.103

  The experiment revealed that 10 times more people changed their
consent behaviour when nudged towards the privacy-friendly option,
using the following nudges: defaults, aesthetic framing and obstructing
the privacy-unfriendly option.

  Thus, nudging users towards the privacy-friendly option through rel-
atively small changes on the interface is indeed efficient, and does not
help users to feel more in control when they make decisions online. In
other words, nudges have no effect on the perception of control by the
users (who actually have a high perception of control when faced with
dark patterns, as shown in Graßl’s first experiment).

  Nouwens and others104 conducted experiments on cookie banners
with (only) 40 participants with 8 different designs. Although they ac-
knowledge the limitations of the representativity of the sample, their
main findings in terms of factors that decrease ‘blind consent’ are the
following:
1. Non-blocking cookie banner (instead of a pop up blocking access)
2. Presence of ‘accept all’ and ‘reject all’ on the same page, and equal

   prominence
3. Displaying more granular consent options on the first page
4. Having a real choice as to consenting or not
5. Understanding the consequences of their choices.

  But overall, Nouwens and others consider the consent model not to be
efficient, given multi-disciplinary evidence that the rational actor model
is flawed, and rather call for legally-binding browser settings, or trusted
third parties to manage consent. Waldman considers for the same rea-
son that legislators should shift away from consent as a legal basis (when

102 Graßl and others (n 12).

applicable) to alternatives such as a fiduciary duty imposed on compa-
nies to treat users’ data in users’ best interests.

3.3. New Concept of Fair Patterns, and Examples of Design

In our opinion, shifting away from consent or nudging users towards pri-
vacy or consumer-friendly options implies giving up on humans’ capacity
to make their own informed choices online, as if the digital economy
necessarily contravenes one of our most human attributes: free choice
and autonomy.

  We do not believe that it is doomed to be this way. Digital per se does
not entail any form of exploitation. As explained by Shoshana Zuboff,
‘the digital can take many forms depending upon the social and eco-
nomic logics that brings it to life’.105 We further argue that dark patterns
are not an inevitable expression of the technology they employ, in other
words, digital does not imply per se manipulation or deception. On the
contrary, given our ever increasingly digital lives, we believe it is pre-
cisely indispensable to reinforce and strengthen some of our deepest
human attributes, our free choice and capacity to make autonomous de-
cisions online.

  As active optimists, we would rather bet on people’s intelligence, once
‘equipped’ with the right knowledge and tools to freely decide for them-
selves, despite the information asymmetry. In addition, informed con-
sent is to date one of the relevant legal bases under the GDPR, which
indeed requires empowering users to understand.

  We therefore propose to:
–– combine meaning-making activities and NeuroDesign not to nudge,

  but to trigger System 2, and to
–– enhance these approaches with a deeply human attribute, autonomy,

  and the new principle of ‘fairness by design’ advocated by the Compe-
  tition & Markets Authority.106

  Jarovsky introduced the concept of ‘Autonomy Preserving Protective
Measures’ (APPMs), to avoid paternalistic protection, based on her defi-
nition of autonomy: The ability of an individual to:

  independently think (understand, reflect),
  decide (critically evaluate) and
  choose (act, implement choice) according to his own preferences and
values.107

  Jarovsky108 identifies three characteristics of APPMs, as non-paternal-
istic measures:

  1. They preserve the individual’s capability to make better choices,
both on the immediate and next occasions (learning curve);

  2. They are transparent in their format and goals;
  3. They are not manipulative, can be rationally perceived and can be
legally questioned.
  In practical terms, Jarovsky identifies several types of APPMs: edu-
cation, icons, consumer-friendly language, formatting requirements,
standardised privacy notices, data collection options.
  In its 2022 report on Online Choice Architecture,109 the Competition
& Markets Authority (CMA) proposed the new concept of fairness by
design, to take into account users’:
–– Limited cognitive capacity: limited bandwidth to allocate attention,
  comprehend information, weight choices and make decisions; thus
  fairness by design requires information to be made accessible with
  limited cognitive effort
–– Sensitivity to how information is presented: frames and nudges
–– Disconnect between intentions and behaviour: guidance, additional
  information or even protective defaults can be required to have con-
  sumers make decisions in their own interests.

  The fairness by design duty proposed by the CMA aims at ensuring
that ‘choices and defaults are presented in a way that facilitates informed
consumer choice’, ‘succinctly, clearly, fairly and in a timely way so that

consumers can easily make informed choices’, and that users are able to
‘access the information, assess it and act on it’.

  We have been trying to make legal information clear, accessible and
actionable under the methodology of ‘legal design’, combining user-cen-
tricity, plain language, some aspects of neurosciences and design to
solve problems since 2018, with some measurable results.110 However,
given the depth and multidisciplinary nature of dark patterns, we argue
that it is necessary to go beyond, to contribute to fighting dark patterns.

  Building on design-driven innovation, NeuroDesign, autonomy pre-
serving protective measures and fairness by design, we introduce the
concept of ‘fair patterns’: interfaces that empower users to make en-
lightened and free choices.

  The term ‘fair’ seems preferable to ‘light’ or ‘bright’ patterns to illus-
trate that we are not just advocating for the opposite of dark patterns
(which would be nudging), but going one step further and empowering
users to make their own decisions according to their preferences.:
–– Fair as opposed to deceiving and misleading dark patterns, but equip-

  ping users with the right knowledge and tools, to preserve their auto-
  nomy, which is a central human attribute
–– Fair because they empower users to make their own choices, while
  avoiding paternalism
–– Fair because users are informed about the consequences of their choi-
  ces, and are thus able to make meaningful choices
–– Fair because they aim at triggering System 2, or limiting the negative
  consequences of System 1, to help users pause for a second, reflect
  and then decide - to do so, we namely rely on the hedonic qualities
  or interfaces (aesthetic framing) not to nudge, but to engage users to
  read, reflect and decide
–– Fair to foster sustainability of the digital economy, inspired by the fair-
  ness by design duty proposed by the CMA.111

  On this basis, fair patterns include information that is easily:

     uring the Value’ in Marcelo Corrales Compagnucci, Helena Haapio and Mark Fen-
     wick(eds) Research Handbook on Contract Design (1st edn, Elgar Online 2022).

452                             Marie Potel-Saville

–– Accessible: information and choices are clear and easy to access so
  that users can easily review and adjust settings

–– Balanced: all information and options are presented in a fair and ba-
  lanced way, using the same colours, fonts, language and other design
  features across all options.

–– Consistent and enabling: periodically remind users of their current
  choice settings and available controls, e.g. using dashboard.

  To be considered ‘fair patterns’, we propose the criteria below, build-
ing on Graßl,112 Nouwens,113 Jarovsky114 and the CMA.115 In the table be-
low, one criterion can meet several goals:

        Goals pursued                                      Criteria

                             also resisting them and taking action (e.g. reporting dark
                             patterns to halls of shame, regulators or NGOs to prompt

  At the time of writing, we have created 23 prototypes of fair patterns,
which are currently under review by independent experts including neu-
roscientists, economists, privacy experts, legal scholars and consumer
protection experts.

  An example of a fair pattern would look like this:

4. Discussion, Limitations and Next Steps

4.1. Discussion

It is clear that dark patterns are a crucial contemporary issue in the digi-
tal economy at a global level, and there is multi-disciplinary evidence for
this. The current state of research has demonstrated the individual and
structural harms, and regulations are changing around the world.118

  Among the characteristics that make dark patterns ‘efficient’, and
hence dangerous for users, are the fact that they rely on System 1 and
cognitive biases, they are cheap to implement, and easy to scale and ‘re-
fine’ thanks to frequent A/B testing, potentially combined with algorith-
mic marketing, and they are particularly efficient towards ‘vulnerable’
users or users with special needs.119

  Is the concept of fair patterns and more importantly the criteria grid
robust enough to address all these factors? At the time of writing, we
have asked ten independent experts in neurosciences, cognitive psychol-
ogy and UX, privacy, law and technology, design and consumer protec-
tion to analyse our work from a conceptual point of view, including our
criteria grid, and to review our 23 current prototypes of fair patterns. We
have also asked behavioural and competition economists to review our
work specifically to identify possible incentives for businesses to switch
from dark to fair patterns, or another solution, if better suited.

  At this stage, on a conceptual level, given that part of the issue lies in
interfaces that trigger System 1, it makes sense to try to activate System
2, namely by increasing the perception of control and fighting against
user fatigue.

  As regards the fact that dark patterns are cheap and easily scalable, it
is important to realise that there is what Mathur and others describe as
an ‘ecosystem of third-party entities’ creating dark patterns and enabling
them at scale.120 In their now famous crawl of about 11,000 shopping
websites, they discovered a total of 22 third-party entities, embedded in

118 OECD (n 12) 1.
119 ibid.
120 Mathur and others (n 13).
456  Marie Potel-Saville

1,066 of the shopping websites in their dataset, and in 7,769 of the Alexa
top million websites. Based on publicly available marketing material on
their websites, Mathur and others classified these third-parties into two
groups:
–– third parties focusing on social proof notifications as a service, and
–– third parties providing a wide range of digital marketing services, some

  of them are dark patterns, mostly scarcity and urgency.
   Mathur and others found that many of these third-parties openly ad-
vertise manipulative practices, such as ‘[p]lay upon [customers’] fear of
missing out by showing shoppers which products are creating a buzz on
your website’ (Fresh Relevance), ‘[c]reate a sense of urgency to boost
conversions and speed up sales cycles with Price Alert Web Push’ (In-
sider), ‘[t]ake advantage of impulse purchases or encourage visitors over
shipping thresholds’ (Qubit), or even sheer scam such as a Woocom-
merce notification advertising fake social proof message ‘[t]he plugin
will create fake orders of the selected products’.
  This fairly frightening ‘ecosystem’ led us to create ‘off-the shelf’ fair
patterns which are being developed at the time of writing. The idea is to
create very accessible and affordable plug-ins that could be easily inte-
grated into e-commerce sites, for example a fair purchasing funnel, a fair
subscription funnel, etc.121
  As regards the increased efficiency of dark patterns thanks to A/B test-
ing and algorithms, where basically companies can “improve” their dark
patterns by testing various versions (A / B) and observe which works
the best for their purposes, the OECD122 notes that currently dark pat-
terns are documented in the literature to operate in the same way for
all consumers, regardless of their specificities or behaviours.123 However,
they point out that some researchers consider that dark patterns will be
increasingly personalised thanks to algorithmic methods, and thus more
able to target users’ vulnerabilities at a granular level.124

121 We are currently working on the technical aspects, in parallel with the expert audit
     and further improvement of the concept and of each prototype.

From Dark to Fair Patterns?  457

  Some researchers argue that ‘businesses may be able to target con-
sumers with the dark patterns to which they may be most vulnerable,
for instance based on data concerning e.g. where they live (e.g. residents
of a retirement village, or people from certain language backgrounds),
whether they suffer from a specific health-related vulnerability (e.g.
mental illness), or are in a specific emotional or physiological state (e.g.
bereavement)’.125

  These possibilities might trigger a need to rethink the notion of ‘vul-
nerable consumers’ itself, to take into account a broader set of circum-
stances, bearing in mind that some authors consider all users vulnerable
online.126

  At this stage of our work, it might be worth exploring whether fair
patterns could be applied in data mining and algorithmic approaches,
precisely to prevent this risk. For example, in 2014 Haijan and others
introduced the concept of ‘fair patterns discovery’, aiming at addressing
the discrimination risks in data mining, and presented a ‘set of pattern
sanitization methods’.127

4.2. Limitations

It is now clear in the literature that certain subsets of users are particu-
larly vulnerable to dark patterns128. The following vulnerable groups have
been identified, in a non-extensive way:
–– users who are less tech-savvy, such as elderly people with less develo-

  ped technology skills or less educated people;129

–– minors, mainly due to the following characteristics: ‘having immature
  executive function; forming imaginative relationships with characters;
  being susceptible to rewards; being indifferent to or unfamiliar with
  data privacy; and lacking understanding of virtual currencies’,130 in
  particular when they use apps131 or video games;132

–– less educated consumers, who are more susceptible to ‘mild’ or subt-
  le dark patterns than better educated consumers, as shown by Bon-
  gard-Blanchy and others133 and the European Commission.134

  At the time of writing, some of our prototypes take into account mi-
nors’ vulnerabilities, based on our previous research on privacy,135 for
example by featuring protecting privacy defaults (contrary to neutral de-
fault for adults, to avoid paternalism), but we have not yet addressed the
wide range of other vulnerabilities, or cultural differences.

  It would be worth exploring in particular (i) how fair patterns can be
adapted to young adults as well as people with cognitive impairments
(on the ASD), mental health disorders (social anxiety or panic disorder,
among others) or lower IQ, and (ii) how cultural differences impact us-
ers’ perception of control, general vulnerability to dark patterns, and
triggers to System 2. We plan to advance our work in this aspect as well,
and call for further research, building on existing work and experiments,
namely by the World Wide Web Foundation.136

totypes of fair patterns with users, ideally in several regions of the world,
focusing in particular on measuring the cost of fair patterns on cognitive
load compared to other existing patterns (dark or light and bright). This
measure seems essential to further improve fair patterns accordingly
and reduce potential resistance to change at the individual and corpo-
rate level.

  We are also developing plug-ins (i) to ease the actionability of fair pat-
terns for businesses, and (ii) for the general public to raise awareness
and help trigger System 2.

  Raising awareness more generally is essential, and we are producing a
dedicated podcast for designers, developers, digital marketers, product
owners, lawyers and anyone interested in fighting deceptive practices
online. We have also identified two ‘halls of shame’ where users can
name and shame and report dark patterns: one by Harry Brignull137 and
a tipline138 hosted by the Digital Civil Society Lab at Stanford. However,
what seems to be missing is a clear way to report dark patterns to regu-
lators in each jurisdiction – this would be an interesting opportunity for
regulators to collaborate across disciplines as data protection authorities
have jurisdiction over some dark patterns, while consumer protection
regulators have jurisdiction over some others, and competition author-
ities have jurisdiction if dark patterns are implemented by dominant
firms.

  In this respect, we note that the Digital Services Act specifies that it is
applicable only if other acts are not applicable such as the GDPR or con-
sumer protection legislation. The resulting lack of clarity for users could
be a hurdle in reporting dark patterns. Thus, class actions could be nec-
essary, if the conditions are met in the jurisdictions concerned, to more
efficiently tackle the issue.

  However, it is interesting to note that the European Commission is
conducting a “digital fairness fitness check” in the context of the New
Consumer Agenda, which is evaluating whether the existing consumer
protection legislation (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the
Consumer Rights Directive and the Unfair Contract Terms Directive) is

robust enough to protect consumers in the digital environment, namely
to protect them from dark patterns and deceptive design. The current
trend is therefore to tighten the legislative net around manipulative and
deceptive practices online, so that one way or another (consumer law,
GDPR, DSA and tomorrow, AI Act), offenders are indeed caught.

5. Conclusion

After decades of policy and regulation relying on the myth of the rational
actor, legislators in the US and in the EU are beginning to take into ac-
count humans’ cognitive biases and the fact that they usually make deci-
sions online in a non-rational way, which is prone to prediction and ma-
nipulation. Similarly to King and Stephan, who advocate a fundamental
rethinking of online consent mechanisms in the light of dark patterns, as
well as a shift towards a human-centred approach, we call for policy de-
sign that better takes into account humans as they are, and that enables
humans to thrive in the digital economy. The revision of the GDPR could
be a timely opportunity to apply human-centric policy (neuro)design.

  Furthermore, Margaret Hagan, Director of the Stanford Legal Design
Lab, also calls for solutions that would remove the burden from users
(of having to read and consent each time) and rather place it on com-
panies: initiatives where users would set up their preferences for given
situations once and for all, and companies would have to abide by such
expressed preferences.

  We are also seeing a growing number of issues emerging with Arti-
ficial Intelligence in relation to dark patterns: it is actually quite easy
to train generative AI to create deceptive or manipulative practices. In
addition, hyper personalisation of interfaces thanks to AI could lead to
“hyper manipulation”, and all the more in dematerialised interfaces such
as connected glasses or VR headsets. We are already seeing examples
of anthropomorphism that are meant to deceive users. The draft AI Act
already prohibits some forms of dark patterns but it is critical that any
future legislation ensures that it captures all forms of AI-enabled manip-
ulative or deceptive experiences.

Legal design has been with us for over a decade. Its core idea, i.e. to
use design methods to make the world of law accessible to all, has
been widely embraced by academics, researchers, and professionals.
Over time, the field has grown, expanding its initial problem-solving
approach to other dimensions of design, such as speculative design,
design fiction, proactive law, and disciplines like cognitive science
and philosophy.
The book presents a state-of-the-art reflection on legal design
evolution and applications. It features twelve insightful contributions
discussed during the 2023 ‘Legal Design Roundtable’ on ‘Design(s)
for Law’, organised within the Erasmus+ Jean Monnet clinic on ‘EU
Digital Rights, Law, and Design’. These perspectives from academics
and professionals add important nuances to the literature, either
presenting new approaches, applying consolidated practices to new
contexts and areas, or showcasing actual and potential applications.
Ideal for academics, legal professionals, and students, this book is a
must-read for anyone interested in new critical approaches to the law
and in the creative construction of fairer and more human-friendly
legal systems.
