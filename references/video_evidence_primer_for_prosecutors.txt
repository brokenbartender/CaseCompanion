Video Evidence

A Primer for Prosecutors

Even ten years ago, it was rare for a court case to feature video evidence, besides a defendant’s statement.
Today, with the increasing use of security cameras by businesses and homeowners, patrol-car dashboard
and body-worn cameras by law enforcement, and smartphones and tablet cameras by the general public, it
is becoming unusual to see a court case that does not include video evidence. In fact, some estimate that
video evidence is involved in about 80 percent of crimes.1 Not surprisingly, this staggering abundance of video
brings with it both opportunities and challenges. Two such challenges are dealing with the wide variety of
video formats, each with its own proprietary characteristics and requirements, and handling the large file sizes
of video evidence. Given these obstacles, the transfer, storage, redaction, disclosure, and preparation of video
evidence for evidentiary purposes can stretch the personnel and equipment resources of even the best-funded
prosecutor’s office. This primer provides guidance for managing video evidence in the office and suggests
steps to take to ensure that this evidence is admissible in court.

Introduction

The opportunities inherent in video evidence cannot be overlooked. It is prosecutors

who are charged with presenting evidence to a jury. Today, juries expect video to

be presented to them in every case, whether it exists or not.2 As a result, prosecutors

must have the resources and technological skill to seamlessly present it in court. Ideally,

prosecutors’ offices could form specially trained litigation support units, which manage all video

evidence from the beginning of the criminal process through trial preparation and the appellate

process. Short of that, individual trial attorneys

must understand the opportunities and be aware

of the potential pitfalls inherent in video evidence. To use video evidence

The purpose of this resource is to provide

prosecutors educational material, introduce

helpful resources regarding video evidence,

outline the benefits of its use in court, and acknowledge the challenges faced by prosecutors’

offices in handling video evidence. A sample process flow is also provided as step-by-step

guidance on the general procedures and processes prosecutors may follow when preparing and

handling video evidence. It has been designed to correspond to the typical flow of a case from

receipt of evidence through the trial process. Finally, a glossary of terms used throughout this

resource is included, as well as a list of recommended resources for further reading.

This document was a collaborative effort executed through the Global Justice Information
    Sharing Initiative (Global), which is supported by BJA, Office of Justice Programs,
         U.S. Department of Justice. Global acknowledges that this document does not
              address all subject areas of this complex topic but rather provides a high-level
                   understanding of video-evidence processes to help guide prosecutors.

& Benefits Challenges

Video evidence can come from numerous sources, with both benefits and challenges.

Examples

 of Video-Evidence Sources

 The following are examples of sources of video evidence from which video may be recorded or recovered.
      • Security cameras/digital video recorders (DVRs) at government buildings, businesses, or private homes
      • Traffic and toll-booth cameras
      • Red-light cameras
      • License plate readers
      • Video/audio recording technology triggered by gunshots
      • Patrol-car cameras
      • Body-worn cameras (BWCs)3
      • Law enforcement interviews of witnesses and suspects at police stations
      • Social media providers (pursuant to search warrants) and/or screen captures made by law enforcement
      • Forensic searches from digital devices (e.g., computer, phone, tablet), pursuant to search warrants

Benefits

 of Using Video Evidence

 It is important to note that while video evidence may be only one piece of evidence in a case, it can be extremely powerful.
 The following are examples of the power of using video evidence in presenting a case to the jury.

      • Incorporate into opening and closing arguments (e.g., showing the jury critical parts of the defendant’s recorded
           confession)

      • Incorporate clips into a slideshow presentation or trial presentation software
      • Capture and print stills for use as supplemental exhibits
      • Potential for the in-court identification of the defendant as the perpetrator
      • Captures the identified defendant in the act of committing the crime
      • May corroborate eyewitness testimony
      • May be used to impeach defense witness testimony

                                                                                                                              Video Evidence: A Primer for Prosecutors / 3
Challenges

for Prosecutors Using Video Evidence

The resource challenges documented below do not come close to the degree of impact that the volume of video from
body-worn cameras will have on prosecutor office resources, once BWCs are widely adopted across the United States.4
Aside from these impending challenges, video evidence is subject to a host of other procedures and challenges that
differ from other types of evidence. These include the following:

    • Having the proper video players and codecs installed on the prosecutor’s computer
    • Having enough time and resources to review video, often within severe court-imposed charging time constraints

         (e.g., 24 to 48 hours) for in-custody suspects
    • Obtaining and affording adequate storage

         for the video in the prosecutor’s office
    • Developing processes and protocols for the

         storage of video in the prosecutor’s office
    • Redacting video for privacy and legal

         challenges
    • Allocating sufficient time for discovery, a

         time-sensitive and time-consuming process
         involving redaction, rendering, and creating
         copies of all discoverable video evidence
    • The cost of equipment and software to
         review, process, prepare, and share video
         evidence
    • Ensuring that personnel have the
         technical and legal training to comply with
         constitutional disclosure requirements,
         the National District Attorneys Association
         (NDAA) Rules of Conduct, National Prosecution Standards,5 and all other relevant law
    • If a video is edited, it must go through a rendering process. The current state-of-the-art, high-end video
         rendering equipment and software can cost in excess of $100,000. Video rendering can be accomplished with
         desktop computers, but at a much slower rate.
         Example: A prosecutor may have an eight-hour homicide video interview that the court has ordered to be
         redacted to eliminate polygraph references. This can be accomplished by using video-evidence software or
         screen-capture software. Both processes require rendering. Using a standard desktop, an eight-hour video may
         take eight hours or longer to render.

    • Responding to novel legal challenges related to the use of video evidence
    • Preserving video evidence for appeal

                 As discussed in this section, video evidence can come from a host of sources. It can be both
                   beneficial to a case as well as challenging for prosecutors. The following section will help

               prosecutors address these challenges and will provide guidance on the video-evidence process.

  Advanced Video Use Tips

   Prosecutors may consider using slideshow or trial presentation software to present
   video evidence in court. It allows for case organization, seamless presentation, and
   flexibility on direct examination and cross-examination.

   1. Depending on the needs or strategy of the case, a prosecutor may want to have the audio
        portions of any video transcribed for use as exhibits in court. Current litigation software
        allows video files to be synchronized to transcripts for simultaneous viewing in court. It is
        important to note that this process can be time-consuming and expensive.

   2. Prosecutors may wish to identify clips for use in opening, direct, cross, and closing statements
        with slideshow software and/or trial presentation software. If necessary, individual clips can
        be created with nonproprietary video software or with screen-capture software. These clips are made
        from video files that have already been provided to the defense counsel. Prosecutors may consider creating a disc
        of clips to admit as a separate exhibit with defense stipulation; however, this is not required, since in most cases the
        original disc was already admitted for the record.

6 / Video Evidence: A Primer for Prosecutors
Trial Tip

An eyewitness to the material on the video may answer questions about events shown
in the video as it is played for the jury or shortly after it is played, depending on the
jurisdiction. In addition, a witness who has some specialized knowledge about the video or
the events depicted therein that is helpful to the jury in understanding the video may testify
about that knowledge. For example, a person familiar with a subject in the video may identify
that person, or an officer who has viewed the video multiple times or in slow motion may point
out items in the video that might not be apparent on full-speed initial view. However, neither
the prosecutor nor any witness can give an opinion about what the video shows that does not rest
on special knowledge that the jury does not have. Doing this invades the province of the jury and is
improper.

enforcement investigators, legal interns, and clerical staff are examples of personnel who could make up the technicians
in such a unit.
Prosecutors’ offices should pursue training on trial presentation software, slideshow software, video/audio editing
software, trial advocacy, and courtroom technology.

Conclusion

The growing amount of video now available from security cameras, patrol-car dashboard and body-worn cameras, and
smart devices is creating a significant strain on budgets and resources across the justice domain. While the availability
of video evidence can present opportunities for prosecutors who are charged with presenting evidence to a jury, the
complex process of transferring, storing, redacting, disclosing, and preparing video evidence for evidentiary purposes is
having a considerable impact on prosecutors’ offices. With video evidence estimated to be involved in approximately
80 percent of crimes, prosecutors must have the resources and technological skill to seamlessly and effectively present
video evidence in court. To do this, they must have a clear understanding of both the benefits and challenges of video
evidence and, more important, the solutions and techniques to address them. This primer provides general guidance
on the procedures and processes prosecutors may follow, from pre- to post-trial, when preparing and handling video
evidence.

15 The silent witness theory is a theory in the law of evidence whereby photographic evidence (as photographs or videotapes)
produced by a process whose reliability is established may be admitted as substantive evidence of what it depicts without the need
for an eyewitness to verify the accuracy of its depiction. In People of Illinois v. Taylor, 956 N.E.2d 431, 353 ILL. Dec. 569 (2011),
surveillance video of the defendant committing the crime was captured on a digital medium and transferred to a VHS tape for trial.
The defense continually objected on foundational grounds, arguing that it had not been shown that the camera worked properly.
The Illinois Court of Appeals, after discussing the silent witness theory, found that the tape was inadmissible based on issues
demonstrating chain of custody, confirming the camera worked properly, ensuring the original digital recording was preserved, and
concerns regarding the method used to transfer the video from digital to VHS format. While the Illinois Supreme Court agreed with
the issues the Court of Appeals examined, it disagreed with its analysis and found adequate support for each foundational factor
within the trial record and under Illinois law. The tape was ultimately admitted and the defendant’s conviction affirmed. Chain-of-
custody issues in establishing foundation generally go to weight, not admissibility.
