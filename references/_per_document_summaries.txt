Refined Video Analysis Summary (Court‑Ready)
Video Conditions
The footage is recorded in a low‑light hallway with strong purple/blue neon lighting. This lighting obscures fine details such as bruising or discoloration. The video begins after the initial assault; the attacker is already on the ground when recording starts.
1. Timeline (Second‑by‑Second)
00:00 – 00:15
The attacker is prone on the floor.
You are kneeling over him, applying controlled weight to keep him pinned.
Attacker: “You’re gonna get sued so bad.”

VIDEO CLIP #2 — FORMAL DESCRIPTION & ANALYSIS (FINAL VERSION)
Note on Conditions
The clip is filmed in predominantly pink and red lighting. The camera is extremely shaky due to the physical struggle occurring within inches of the person recording. The chaotic motion in the first 5 seconds makes it difficult to track specific limb movements.

00:00 – 00:05 — Break of Restraint
The video opens mid‑struggle on the floor.
The attacker (black shirt) is violently kicking his legs and twisting his hips in an attempt to break free.

### Assault_Case_Victim_Impact_Oral-Cody.docx.txt
Your Honor, on August 20th, 2025, while I was working at Liberty Bar, I was assaulted by Jeffery Snyder. I stepped in to protect a female patron he was attacking, and during the struggle there was a moment where everything went black. I came back to myself while holding him down on the floor. That moment has stayed with me, and it was the first time I ever felt unsafe in a place where I was supposed to be in control.
Physically, I ended up in the ER with a shoulder contusion and needed medication for pain and anxiety. For weeks I struggled with basic movement, and I still have discomfort today.
Emotionally, this incident changed how I function. I deal with anxiety, panic symptoms, and hypervigilance. Loud noises or sudden movements can trigger stress, and I’ve had to rely on medication to manage it. I no longer feel safe in the kind of work environment I used to handle confidently.
Financially, I missed work and lost income. I was later fired while still dealing with the effects of the assault, which created a lot of instability in my life. Even with insurance, I had out‑of‑pocket costs and transportation expenses while trying to recover.
I didn’t provoke this. I was doing my job and trying to protect someone who was being harmed. This assault has affected my physical health, my emotional well‑being, and my financial stability. I ask the Court to consider the full impact of this incident when making decisions in this case.
Thank you, Your Honor.

### Assault_Case_Victim_Impact_Statement_Shelby_Oral.docx.txt
Your Honor, on August 20th, 2025, I was assaulted by Jeffery Snyder while I was sitting at the bar with a friend. He became angry after we told him we weren’t interested in talking to him. He threw a drink on us, and before I could react, he punched me multiple times in the face. I remember feeling shocked and overwhelmed, and parts of the incident are still a blur to me.
Since that night, I’ve dealt with fear, anxiety, and a loss of confidence in public places. I used to feel comfortable going out with friends, but now I’m constantly on edge around strangers, especially in crowded environments. Loud voices or sudden movements make me tense up, and I’ve had trouble sleeping because I keep replaying what happened.
Physically, I had bruising, broken nails, and soreness for days, but the emotional impact has lasted much longer. I still feel the effects of being attacked without warning, and it has changed how I move through the world.
I didn’t provoke this situation. I was simply out with a friend, and his actions caused harm that I’m still dealing with. I ask the Court to consider the impact this has had on my safety and well‑being.
Thank you, Your Honor.

### Assault_Case_Victim_Statement___Incident_Summary.odt.txt
ASSAULT CASE SUMMARY Victim: Cody E. McKenzie Defendant: Jeffery Snyder Incident Date: August 20, 2025 Location: Liberty Bar &amp; Poutinerie, 85 N Saginaw St, Pontiac, MI Law Enforcement Case #: OCSO 25‑195158 Criminal Case #: 2025‑251105SM‑SM    INCIDENT OVERVIEW   On August 20, 2025, while working as a bartender at Liberty Bar &amp; Poutinerie, I was the victim of a violent, unprovoked assault committed by customer  Jeffery Snyder . The incident began inside the bar and continued into the hallway, where additional witnesses observed his aggressive behavior.   DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSAULT   Based on my statement, witness accounts, and the police report:    Snyder initiated the assault by  striking me in the right shoulder with a closed‑fist punch , delivered with enough force to cause immediate pain and reduced mobility.     He also struck a female patron and attempted to hit additional individuals during the escalation.     As the situation moved toward the hallway, Snyder continued acting aggressively until he was physically restrained by bystanders.     The hallway portion of the incident was recorded by witness  Wrobel , capturing Snyder’s continued aggression and the aftermath of the initial assault.     Although the initial punch is not on video, the recorded footage documents Snyder’s ongoing violent behavior consistent with the injuries sustained.   INJURIES &amp; MEDICAL TREATMENT     I experienced immediate pain, weakness, and limited range of motion in my right shoulder.     I sought emergency medical treatment at  Trinity Health , where imaging and examination confirmed a shoulder injury consistent with blunt‑force trauma.

Statement
My name is Shelby Herron, and I am providing this statement regarding the assault that occurred at Liberty Bar on the night of August 20th, 2025.
While I was inside the bar, a male customer wearing a black shirt became aggressive toward me without any provocation. He threw his drink on me, and during the confrontation that followed, he struck me in the face. I did not hit him first. His actions caused me to feel scared, shocked, and unsafe.
After he hit me, Cody McKenzie stepped in to protect me and to stop the situation from getting worse. The attacker continued to act aggressively, and Cody restrained him on the ground until the police could arrive. During this time, the attacker was yelling, threatening Cody, and trying to get up. I saw him twisting, kicking, and trying to break free from Cody’s hold.
At one point, I asked a bystander to watch and record what was happening because I was afraid the attacker would try to leave or deny what he had done. I said, “I need you to watch this, please,” because I wanted to make sure there was a witness to his behavior.
When the attacker managed to get up, he did not leave even though he was standing right next to the exit. Instead, he turned back toward us, yelling and acting aggressively. Cody told people in the hallway that the attacker had punched me in the face. The attacker did not deny this and continued yelling profanity.
I was shaken and scared throughout the incident. I stayed near the wall and away from the attacker while waiting for the police to arrive. I cooperated fully with officers when they came.
Everything in this statement is true to the best of my knowledge and reflects what I personally saw, experienced, and said during the incident.
