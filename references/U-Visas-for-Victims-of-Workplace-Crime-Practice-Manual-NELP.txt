The U Visa: A Potential Immigration Remedy for
Immigrant Workers Facing Labor Abuse

What is a U visa?
A “U visa” is a temporary non-immigrant status available to non-citizen victims of certain crimes. Congress
created the U visa as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act of 2000, in order to
strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute certain crimes against
immigrants and to offer protection to victims who fear cooperating with law enforcement due to their
immigration status.

What Are the Benefits of a U visa?
U visa holders are eligible for the following benefits:

     Lawful status for up to 4 years;
     Eligibility to adjust status to lawful permanent resident after 3 years;
     Automatic grant of work authorization;
     Derivative visas for qualifying family members.

What are the eligibility requirements for a U visa?
In order to be eligible for a U visa, an immigrant worker must:
1) Have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been a victim of a qualifying criminal
activity;
2) Possess information concerning the qualifying criminal activity;
3) Have been helpful, be helpful, or be likely to be helpful in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of the
qualifying criminal activity;1
4) Show that the qualifying criminal activity violated a local, state, or federal law, or have occurred in the United
States.2

What constitutes a qualifying criminal activity?
U visa regulations identify 28 categories of qualifying criminal activity (QCAs) and any other substantially similar
criminal activity as eligible for certification.3 Advocates should identify violations of local, state, or federal
statutes that may correspond to the qualifying criminal activity when seeking certification. Law enforcement
agencies may also certify U visa petitions for attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation of the qualifying criminal activity.

1 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(5) defines “investigation or prosecution” of a qualifying crime or criminal activity as referring to “the detection or investigation of a
qualifying crime or criminal activity, as well as to the prosecution, conviction, or sentencing of the perpetrator of the qualifying crime or criminal activity.”

What are some examples of worker abuse that may constitute qualifying criminal
activity?
Below is a list of qualifying criminal activity and corresponding fact patterns that have received certification.
Please note that statutory requirements and elements of offenses may vary by jurisdiction.

   Felonious Assault
    Abusive touching, battery, beating, or use of a weapon by employer resulting in substantial mental or

       physical harm.

   Fraud in Foreign Labor Contracting
    False representations by employers to contracted workers on conditions of employment, housing,

       fees to labor brokers, food and transportation, ability to work at other places of employment, and

       other material aspects of the work arrangement.

   Involuntary Servitude/Peonage/Labor Trafficking
    Threats of physical, psychological, financial or reputational restraint or harm by employer that

       compels an individual to continue work;
    Threats to contact local law enforcement or immigration authorities by employer in order to

       compel continued work;
    Confiscation or withholding of identity documents, passports, or other travel documents by

       employer;
    Supporting facts could include: wage theft; inadequate food, housing, medical care or clothing;

       lengthy hours; verbal or physical abuse; restricted contact with others; use of locks and fences to
       restrict workers’ mobility (see also false imprisonment/unlawful criminal restraint).4

   Obstruction of Justice/Perjury/Witness Tampering
    Evidence of visa fraud, false statements in seeking certification for labor, misuse of visas by employer;

       fraudulent wage and hour records;
    Instructions to lie to law enforcement investigations by employer;
    Intimidation of workers who seek to comply with law enforcement investigations or affirmative

       complaints against an employer, including threats to contact local law enforcement or immigration

       authorities.5

4 Involuntary servitude includes a condition of servitude induced by any scheme “intended to cause a person to believe that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such
condition, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; . . . or the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process.” 22 U.S.C. § 7102(5). See
also 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(c)(1)-(2) (definition of serious harm and abuse of the law or legal process).

                                    APPENDIX A2
The U Visa: A Potential Remedy for Immigrant Workers

         Abusive Sexual Contact/Rape/Sexual Assault/Sexual exploitation
          Unwelcome sexual contact, rape, assault, or exploitation by co-workers, employers, or clients.

What government agencies have the authority to certify a U Visa petition?
Federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and judges may certify a U visa petition. U visa
regulations specify that agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of
Labor, which have criminal investigative jurisdiction in their respective areas of expertise, are valid certifying
agencies.6 Federal judges have also certified U visa petitions in the context of labor abuse.7

Several labor enforcement agencies have released certification protocol for U visas. These agencies include the
U.S. Department of Labor (US DOL), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB), as well as the New York Department of Labor (NY DOL), and the California
Department of Fair Housing and Employment (CA DFEH). Other agencies, such as the California Division of
Labor Standards Enforcement (CA DLSE), have indicated plans to issue certification protocol. In addition, local,
state, and federal law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and judges have certified U visa petitions for
workplace-related crimes. Copies of agency protocols are available at http://www.just-pay.org.

How do you petition for a U visa?
In order to successfully petition for a U visa, the applicant must first obtain certification from a law enforcement
agency stating that he or she is a victim and has been, is currently, or likely to be helpful in the detection,
investigation, or prosecution of a qualifying criminal activity. The certification form, Form I-918 Supplement B,
must be signed by a supervisory agent from the certifying agency.

After obtaining certification, the applicant must then submit a complete U visa petition to U.S. Customs and
Immigration Services (USCIS), which has authority to grant the U visa. The petition should include:

     Form I-918 “Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status”
     Form I-918B “U Nonimmigrant Status Certification”
     Filing Fee ($585) and biometrics fee ($80) or fee waiver
     Supplemental evidence: personal statement, other evidence of abuse/injury
     Copy of identity page of applicant’s passport (or request for waiver)
     Form I-192 “Application for Advance Permission to Enter as Non-Immigrant”
     Form G-28 “Notice of Entry as Appearance of Attorney or Accredited Representative”
     Form I-918A “Petition for Qualifying Family Members of U-1 Recipient”

The U Visa: A Potential Remedy for Immigrant Workers

How can U visas affect immigrant worker organizing?
The successful grant of a U visa may support organizing by providing relief to immigrant leaders willing to call
attention to workplace abuse, and by strengthening investigation and enforcement of labor laws. Employment
authorization gained through a U visa may also provide plaintiffs with eligibility for damages in private lawsuits.
However, the highly individualized nature of U visa relief may pose challenges in broader organizing contexts
where all workers may not have encountered similar treatment by an abusive employer.

Legislative proposals, including the Protect Our Workers from Exploitation and Retaliation Act (POWER Act)
(S 3207), introduced by Senator Robert Menendez in 2010, could provide key labor protections for immigrants
who face retaliation by employers. Specifically, the POWER Act expands U visa protections to workers involved
in civil workplace claims and who fear or have received threats of force, physical restraint, or harm in retaliation
by employers.

   APPENDIX A2
             The U Visa: How Can It Protect

             Immigrant Workers?

All immigrant workers—including documented and undocumented workers—are protected by employment
laws in the United States. Under these laws, all workers should be able to work in safe working conditions,
receive minimum wage and overtime pay, and be free from harassment and abuse by employers. Many workers
are afraid to report crimes to authorities because they fear detention or deportation due to their status.
However, Congress has created the U visa to help undocumented victims of crime to come forward.

To qualify for a U visa, you must:
1) Have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been a victim of a crime;
2) Have credible and reliable information about the crime;
3) Have been helpful, be helpful, or be likely to be helpful in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of the
crime;
4) Show that the crime occurred in the United States.

What are the benefits of a U visa?
     Temporary legal status and work permit for up to 4 years;
     Eligibility to adjust status to lawful permanent resident after 3 years;
     Temporary residency and work permit for some family members:
              o Spouse, children, unmarried siblings under 18, and parents if you are younger than 21;
              o Spouse and unmarried children under 21 if you are older than 21;
              o Family members do not have to be in the U.S. when you apply for a U visa.

What kinds of crimes qualify?
Several crimes, including those that take place in the workplace, qualify for a U visa. These include:

     Abusive sexual contact, rape, sexual assault, or sexual exploitation
     Felonious assault: abusive touching, beating, or use of a weapon that causes serious harm. This may

         include touching of a sexual nature.
     Extortion: an employer may obtain something of value—including money, by using threats or force
     Involuntary servitude or peonage: An employer makes threats, including threats to contact immigration

         authorities, to force you to continue to work.
     Obstruction of justice, perjury, or witness tampering: An employer may instruct you to lie to law

         enforcement investigations, intimidate workers from filing complaints, or force you to destroy or hide
         evidence of a crime.

The U visa application process:
To apply for a U visa,

         1)You should meet with an attorney for an initial screening
         2) Your attorney will contact a certifying agency (for example, the Equal Employment Opportunity
         Commission (EEOC), Department of Labor (DOL)) or a judge to provide a document that proves a
         crime took place and that you are helping or are likely to help in the investigation or prosecution of a
         crime.
         3) Your attorney will submit your petition for a U visa based on the information filed. There is no fee
         for this.
         4) If you or a family member is not admissible (for example, if you entered the country without
         authorization or have a criminal record), you will have to file a waiver. You will have to pay a fee of
         $585, but it can be waived if you earn very little.

                                                                                   APPENDIX A3
               La Visa U : ¿Cómo protege a los

                  trabajadores inmigrantes?

Todos los trabajadores inmigrantes, inclusive los trabajadores documentados e indocumentados — están protegidos
por las leyes de empleo en los Estados Unidos. Bajo estas leyes, todos los trabajadores deben poder trabajar en
condiciones seguras de trabajo, recibir el salario mínimo y pago de tiempo extra y estar libre de acoso y abuso por
parte de los empleadores. Muchos trabajadores tienen miedo a denunciar los delitos, incluyendo el abuso y el acoso,
que pueden pasar en el trabajo a las autoridades, porque temen detención o deportación debido a su condición. Sin
embargo, el Congreso creó la visa U para ayudar a los indocumentados y las indocumentadas víctimas de delitos.

Para calificar para una visa U, usted debe:
1) Haber sufrido abuso físico y mental como consecuencia de haber sido víctima de un delito;
2) Tener información creíble y confiable acerca del delito;
3) Haber sido útil, ser útil o pudiera ser útil en la detección, la investigación o el enjuiciamiento del delito;
4) Mostrar que el crimen paso en los Estados Unidos.

¿Cuáles son los beneficios de la visa U?
      Estatus legal temporal y permiso de trabajo de hasta 4 años;
      Elegibilidad para ajustar estatus a residente permanente legal después de 3 años;
      Autorización de trabajo y residencia temporal de algunos miembros de la familia:
               o Cónyuge, hijos, hermanos solteros menores de 18 años y los padres si es menor de 21;
               o Cónyuge e hijos solteros menores de 21 si es mayor de 21;
               o Miembros de la familia no tienen que estar en los Estados Unidos al aplicar para una visa U.

¿Qué tipos de crímenes califican?
Varios crímenes, incluyendo aquellas que se realizan en el lugar de trabajo, califican para una visa U. Estos incluyen:

     o Servidumbre involuntaria o peonaje: un empleador hace amenazas, incluida la amenaza de ponerse en
          contacto con las autoridades de inmigración, para forzarlo a seguir trabajando.

     o Asalto criminal: tocar abusivo, paliza o uso de un arma que provoca graves daños. Esto puede incluir contacto
          de naturaleza sexual.

     o Contacto sexual abusivo, violación, agresión sexual o explotación sexual.
     o Extorción: un empleador puede obtener algo de valor — incluyendo dinero, mediante el uso de amenazas o

          la fuerza
     o Obstrucción de la justicia, perjurio o testigos: un empleador lo dirige a mentir en investigaciones policiales,

          intimida a los trabajadores de presentar quejas o lo forza a destruir u ocultar la evidencia de un crimen.

El proceso de solicitud de la visa U:
Para solicitar una visa U,
1) Usted debe reunirse con un abogado para una evaluación inicial;
2) Su abogado se pone en contacto con una agencia de certificación (por ejemplo, la Comisión de Oportunidad Igual
de Empleo (EEOC), el Departamento de Labor (DOL)) o un juez, para que estos proporcionen un documento que
demuestra que un delito tuvo lugar y que usted está ayudando o es probable que ayude en la investigación o el
enjuiciamiento de un delito;
3) Su abogado presenta su petición para la visa U basándose en la información presentada. No hay ninguna cuota para
ello;
4) Si usted o un miembro de la familia no es admisible (por ejemplo, si entraron al país sin autorización o si tiene
antecedentes penales), tendrá que presentar una renuncia. Usted tendrá que pagar una cuota de $585, pero si usted
gana muy poco, lo pueden dejar hacer sin costo.

        MEMORANDUM FOR:  REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS
                         DISTRICT DIRECTORS

        FROM:            NANCY J. LEPPINK
                         Acting Administrator

        SUBJECT:         CERTIFICATION OF SUPPLEMENT B FORMS OF U NONIMMIGRANT VISA
                         APPLICATIONS

        This memorandum discusses the guidelines and procedures the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) will follow to determine when and whether to
        complete and certify Supplement B of a I-918 petition for U Visa Nonimmigrant Visa Status. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to complete and
        certify Supplement B forms for U Nonimmigrant Visas (U Visas) under Section 1513(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of
        2000, as amended, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U) and related Department of Homeland Security regulations, 8 C.F.R. § 214.14. The Secretary’s Order
        05-2010 delegated this authority to the WHD Administrator. This authority is being further delegated to the WHD Regional Administrators. WHD
        Regional and District Office representatives will work closely with Solicitor of Labor Regional Office (RSOL) attorneys to gather, document and
        review the facts and information to determine whether to complete and certify Supplement B form of a I-918 U-Visa petition.

        WHD will regularly evaluate these protocols for effectiveness and efficiency and may revise as it deems necessary.

        I. Background

             A. Statute

        Under Section 1513(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, as amended, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U), victims of qualifying
        criminal activities (QCAs) who have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse may apply for a U Visa if they are willing to assist law enforcement
        or other officials in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over all
        petitions for U nonimmigrant status. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c). 1 Individuals who receive U Visas from USCIS may be authorized to stay in the United
        States for up to 4 years. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(g). USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to individuals who are granted a U
        Visa. See 8 C.F.R.§ § 214.14(c)(7) and (f)(7).

             B. Form I-918

        Nonimmigrants seeking U Visas must submit a completed Form I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status to USCIS for consideration. Supplement B of
        Form I-918 is to be completed by an agency such as the Department of Labor (DOL) that is authorized to complete and certify Supplement B forms as
        a result of its “responsibility for the detection, investigation, prosecution, conviction, or sentencing of qualifying criminal activity.” See 8 C.F.R. §
        214.14(c)(2)(i); Instructions for I-918, Supplement B at 2. In completing Supplement B, the agency must certify that the individual submitting the Form
        I-918 is a victim of certain qualifying criminal activity and is, has been, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of that activity. See
        8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2). 2 An agency’s decision to complete and certify a Supplement B form is entirely discretionary. See Form I-918, Supplement B
        at 1. The applicant is responsible for submitting the entire Form I-918, including Supplement B, to USCIS for review and approval. See 8 C.F.R. §
        214.14(c). The decision whether to approve or deny the Form I-918 Petition rests solely with USCIS.

             C. Applicable Regulations

        Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations specify that Federal or local law enforcement agencies, or other authorities that have
        “responsibility for the investigation or prosecution of a qualifying crime or criminal activity” may complete and certify Supplement B of Form I-918.
        See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(2). The regulations explicitly state that this includes the DOL, as well as other agencies such as the Equal Employment
        Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Id. Further, the regulations define “investigation or prosecution” to include “the detection or investigation of a
        qualifying crime or criminal activity.” See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(5) (emphasis added). WHD will consider exercising its authority to certify Supplement
        B forms in cases in which it has detected a QCA and each of the following conditions are met: (1) the detected QCA is involuntary servitude, peonage,
        trafficking, obstruction of justice or witness tampering; (2) the alleged QCA arises in the context of a work environment or an employment
        relationship; and (3) there is a related, credible allegation of a violation of a law that WHD enforces. The procedures WHD and SOL will follow to
        determine whether to complete and certify a Supplement B form are outlined below.

        II. WHD’s Procedures

        Each WHD Regional Administrator will designate a representative to serve as the coordinator for U Visa petitions for that region. Likewise, each
        Regional Solicitor will designate one attorney to coordinate U Visa petition issues for that SOL region. This will enable DOL to develop the necessary
        expertise to effectively and efficiently handle requests to certify Supplement B forms for U Visa applications. Although WHD intends to hire
        individuals to serve as regional U Visa coordinators, on an interim basis the regional Director of Enforcement (DOE) will serve in this capacity, unless a
        Regional Administrator determines otherwise. The regional WHD U Visa coordinator will work closely with the regional RSOL attorney designated to
        handle U Visa issues.

        Generally speaking, the regional WHD U Visa coordinator will be responsible for overseeing incoming Supplement B form certification requests,
        providing guidance and assistance with related WHD investigations, and coordinating efforts with appropriate law enforcement agencies, social service
        organizations or outside entities representing U Visa applicants, as well as other DOL agencies and the designated RSOL attorney. The designated
        RSOL attorney will conduct any necessary legal research and analysis and provide legal guidance regarding the QCA. The RSOL attorney will prepare
        the Supplement B form I-918 and required supporting documentation, as described below.

        The WHD U Visa coordinator will make a recommendation to the WHD Regional Administrator as to whether or not to certify Supplement B of Form
        I-918. In most cases, the WHD Regional Administrator will be the certifying official, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the WHD Acting
        Administrator.

        The key steps in WHD’s process for completing and certifying Supplement B forms are outlined below.

             A. Investigation of a violation of a law that WHD enforces and detection of a related QCA

        As mentioned above, WHD will consider requests for certification of Supplement B forms in cases in which the alleged QCA arises in the context of a
        work environment or an employment relationship and there is a related, credible allegation of a violation of a law that WHD enforces. There are a
        number of QCAs identified in the DHS regulations and the Form I-918. Of these, WHD has determined that it will consider requests to certify
        Supplement B forms predicated on the following QCAs: involuntary servitude, peonage, trafficking, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering. 3
        WHD believes that these QCAs are most likely to be found in connection with its workplace investigations and that it can effectively train its staff in
        the detection of these QCAs. WHD will document basic information and evidence concerning these QCAs when they are detected during a WHD
        investigation, but it does not have jurisdiction to investigate or prosecute these crimes. Thus, DOL’s authority to complete and certify Supplement B
        forms will be based on its role as a law enforcement agency that has “detected” the crimes.

        Because DOL does not have the authority to investigate and prosecute QCAs, WHD will refer the underlying QCA to appropriate law enforcement
        agencies in accordance with its normal protocols for referral of criminal laws not enforced by WHD. WHD’s role would be to provide, where
        appropriate, detected information to the appropriate law enforcement agency charged with investigating and prosecuting the crime, and to pursue in
        coordination with that law enforcement agency the wage and hour or other workplace claims on behalf of the workers. Whether such a referral is
        made before or after a decision to complete and certify a Supplement B form will depend on the circumstances of a case. In all cases, the safety of the
        petitioner and his or her family should be a primary consideration, as well as the safety of other individuals who have been harmed or may be at risk of
        harm from the detected criminal activity. The regional U Visa coordinator will provide guidance as necessary to the local District Office (DO) as to
        how to manage the referral and will, as appropriate, work with social service organizations or representatives for the petitioner.

        WHD anticipates that Supplement B form certification requests will arise in two primary contexts: (1) during a WHD workplace investigation, or after
        the investigation is completed, an individual connected with the investigation requests that WHD complete and certify a Supplement B form based on a
        detected or alleged QCA; (2) a U Visa petitioner contacts WHD with an allegation of both a violation of a law that WHD enforces and a related QCA
        and requests that WHD complete and certify a Supplement B form. In all cases, the regional U Visa coordinator will be the point of contact for the
        individual seeking Supplement B form certification.

        (1) Requests for certification connected to current or completed WHD investigations If a U Visa petitioner contacts WHD to request certification
        connected to a current or completed WHD investigation, the U Visa coordinator will determine whether one of the five QCAs for which WHD will
        consider requests for certification was detected during the course of the WHD investigation. If the investigation is ongoing, the DO will proceed with
        normal investigation protocols, taking care to document separately any detected information related to the QCA, as discussed further below.

        In any investigation, regardless whether there has been a U Visa request, upon detection of information related to a QCA the DO will alert the regional
        WHD U Visa coordinator. Although Wage and Hour Investigators (WHIs) will only receive training on detecting the five QCAs listed above
        (involuntary servitude, peonage, trafficking, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering), the DO will notify the U Visa coordinator of any QCA it has
        detected. If, during the course of a WHD investigation, the WHI has detected a QCA other than the five enumerated above, the U Visa coordinator
        and the Regional Administrator will determine how best to proceed based on the facts and circumstances of the case. In all cases, the WHD Regional
        U Visa coordinator will maintain information about the detected QCA for use in the event WHD receives a certification request connected with the
        wage and hour investigation. In any case where WHD has detected a QCA during the course of its investigation, when appropriate and feasible WHD
        will notify the victim of, or otherwise utilize the services of, community resources that may be able to assist the victim.

        (2) Requests for certification concurrent with a WHD complaint If a U Visa petitioner contacts WHD claiming a workplace violation of a law that
        WHD enforces and a related QCA, along with requesting certification of a Supplement B form, the DO will proceed with normal intake of the
        underlying wage and hour complaint and forward the information related to the QCA and Supplement B form request to the regional WHD U Visa
        coordinator. The DO should assign the WH complaint for investigation consistent with its normal protocols. The petitioner should provide the U Visa
        coordinator with information that supports his or her allegation of a QCA and related violations of a law that WHD enforces and make him or herself
        available to be interviewed by a representative from WHD.

        Regardless of how a request to certify a Supplement B form originates, the regional WHD U Visa coordinator will review the information detected
        during the WHD investigation, if any, and any information provided by the petitioner related to the QCA and in support of the Supplement B
        certification request, and make a preliminary determination as to whether WHD would potentially certify the Supplement B form. The primary factors
        the WHD U Visa coordinator should consider include whether:

             The QCA arises in the context of an employment relationship or work environment and there is a related, credible allegation of a violation of a law
             that WHD enforces;

U.S. Department of Labor — Wage and Hour Division (WHD) — FIELD...  http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/fab2011_1.htm

             Petitioner alleges a QCA of either involuntary servitude, peonage, trafficking, obstruction of justice, or witness tampering;

             The Petitioner has demonstrated that he or she has been, is being, or is likely to be cooperative with law enforcement officials in any investigation
             or prosecution of the QCA;

             Another law enforcement agency is already engaged in the investigation or prosecution of the QCA or would be in a better position to certify the
             Supplement B form based on the facts presented; and

             Certification of the Supplement B form would assist WHD’s investigation of a violation of a law that it enforces.

        The first three elements listed above are required in order to certify the Supplement B form and the remainder will be weighed in prioritizing requests.
        Although WHD’s detection of a QCA should be considered in the petitioner’s favor, in cases where there is an ongoing or completed WHD
        investigation the fact that WHD did not detect a QCA should not be the basis for denying a certification request.

        If the regional WHD U Visa coordinator makes a preliminary determination that this is a case where WHD would potentially complete and certify a
        Supplement B form, the regional WHD U Visa coordinator should alert the DO that received the wage and hour complaint and also provide the
        designated RSOL attorney with basic information about the case. The RSOL attorney should advise the WHD U Visa coordinator regarding the
        necessary legal elements of the particular QCA and provide advice to WHD U Visa coordinator about the kind of information and evidence that will be
        needed to inform the certification decision. If necessary, as will be the case when there has not yet been a WHD investigation, the regional U Visa
        coordinator will interview the U Visa petitioner to gather and confirm any information needed for the Supplement B form certification decision.

        If the WHD U Visa coordinator makes the preliminary determination that it is unlikely that WHD would certify the Supplement B form based on the
        above factors, the U Visa coordinator should inform the petitioner of that assessment in writing as soon as possible, along with information as to which
        other law enforcement agencies may be able to certify the petition so that the petitioner can explore other avenues for certification.

             B. Investigator Action

        For requests associated with ongoing WHD investigations, the regional WHD U Visa coordinator will work with the appropriate DO to make sure that
        evidence is gathered and documented consistent with the direction set out below to assist with determining whether to certify Supplement B of Form
        I-918. For requests received simultaneously with a complaint alleging a violation of a law WHD enforces, the WHD complaint will be directed to the
        appropriate DO for a determination whether to investigate in accordance with WHD’s Complaint Policy. WHD investigators will not initiate an
        investigation or return to a workplace for the sole purpose of detecting information about a QCA.

        If necessary, such as when a request for certification is received simultaneously with the complaint, the regional U Visa coordinator will interview the U
        Visa petitioner to gather and confirm any information needed for the Supplement B form certification decision. For requests associated with an active
        investigation of a WH violation, the U Visa coordinator will alert the DO and Wage Hour Investigator (WHI) of the request and alleged QCA so that
        the DO knows to keep the U Visa coordinator informed of any relevant evidence detected during the course of the investigation.

        As discussed, WHD does not have jurisdiction to conduct investigations of the QCAs. Consequently, WHD investigators should follow WHD training
        and guidance on detecting crimes that are enforced by other law enforcement agencies.

             C. U Visa Coordinator Action

        The detected facts related to the QCA will be recorded as part of a narrative statement prepared by the U-Visa coordinator. This statement should be a
        separate document and will not be incorporated into the WHD case file. Rather, a separate file folder should be created for the case information that is
        relevant to a particular U Visa petitioner. The narrative statement should:

             Address how the case came to WHD’s attention, and the current status of the WH complaint. For example, it should be noted whether WHD is
             pursuing injunctive and/or monetary remedies to address the WH claims.

             Provide a summary of the information provided by the petitioner to the U Visa coordinator or written information provided by the petitioner,
             which should be attached to the narrative statement, together with a credibility determination by the U Visa coordinator or, if the individual was
             interviewed during the course of a WHD investigation, the WHI.

             Include an assessment of the petitioner’s helpfulness in detecting the QCA and investigating the workplace violation claim, as well as an
             assessment as to whether the individual is likely to be helpful in any future investigation or prosecution of the QCA. This assessment can be made
             based on the helpfulness of the individual to the WHD investigation, the individual’s personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the
             QCA, and other observations made by the WHI and the U Visa coordinator concerning the individual’s general disposition and willingness to assist
             government officials.

             Address what, if anything, has been done or will be done to refer the case to the appropriate law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction to
             investigate and/or prosecute the QCA.

             Document any known injury to the petitioner, if available, and whether any of the petitioner’s family members are believed to have been involved
             in the criminal activity of which he or she is a victim. This information will be needed in order to complete Supplement B of Form I-918.

             D. Legal analysis and review of documentation, and recommendation whether to certify

        Upon completion of the narrative statement, the U Visa coordinator will consult with the designated RSOL attorney regarding whether the information
        set out in the narrative statement and any attachments is sufficient to recommend completion and certification of the Supplement B form. After
        receiving the RSOL attorney’s advice, the U Visa coordinator will make a recommendation to the Regional Administrator as to whether the application
        should be certified. If the U Visa Coordinator, after consultation with the Regional Administrator and the RSOL attorney, concludes that a
        recommendation to certify should be made, the RSOL will proceed to complete the Supplement B, Form I-918. If the conclusion is not to recommend
        certification, the U Visa coordinator will state in writing to the Regional Administrator the reasons for not recommending certification and submit the
        reasons and narrative statement to the Regional Administrator.

        III. Certification Decision

3 of 4  APPENDIX B1                                                 9/15/2011 1:24 PM
U.S. Department of Labor — Wage and Hour Division (WHD) — FIELD...  http://www.dol.gov/whd/FieldBulletins/fab2011_1.htm

             A. Completion of Supplement B, Form I-918

        The designated RSOL attorney will use the narrative statement provided by WHD and the completed legal research and analysis to complete the
        Supplement B of Form I-918. To complete Supplement B, the RSOL attorney will draft an attachment that includes information such as:

             A statement that WHD is involved because it is or was investigating or has received a complaint related to an alleged violation of a law that WHD
             enforces, and that the agency is seeking monetary and injunctive remedies for those violations (if applicable).

             A statement explaining the facts detected and/or alleged that support a finding that the individual has been a victim of a QCA.

             A statement regarding any known injury to the victim, if available, and the individual’s helpfulness in investigating the matter.

             A summary of what has been done (or will be done), if anything, to refer the case to or share information with the appropriate criminal law
             enforcement agency.

             B. Review and certification of Supplement B, Form I-918

        Once RSOL has completed the Supplement B form, it will be sent to the Regional Administrator. In most instances, the final authority to certify will be
        delegated to the Regional Administrator. If the Regional Administrator certifies a Supplement B form, he or she should attach to the form a copy of
        the memoranda delegating the certification authority to the Administrator and further to the Regional Administrator. If the Regional Administrator
        decides not to certify the Supplement B form, the U Visa coordinator should inform the petitioner’s representative of the decision in writing as soon as
        possible, along with information as to which other law enforcement agencies may be able to certify the petition so that the petitioner can explore other
        avenues for certification.

             C. Timeliness and notification of WHD’s certification decision

        It is very important that all requests for U Visa certification be processed expeditiously and that WHD notify the petitioner and/or his or her
        representative of its decision in writing as soon as possible. The timely review of the petitioner’s allegations and, where appropriate, the certification
        of a U Visa petition could help to protect the individual victims of QCAs who may be at risk of future harm, and whose cooperation with law
        enforcement officials will be helpful to investigating or prosecuting the alleged perpetrator(s) of the QCAs. In those cases where WHD determines it
        will be unable to certify a Supplement B form, the petitioner should be provided with information as to which other law enforcement agencies may be
        able to certify the petition.

        WHD anticipates that it will take it three months to review a single U Visa certification request and make a determination as to whether or not to
        certify. This timeframe will vary, however, depending upon the complexity of the case and the overall volume of U Visa certification requests WHD’s
        regional representatives are handling at any one time. This estimated timeline may be adjusted based on WHD’s experience reviewing certification
        requests under the procedures outlined here.

             D. Confidentiality

        DOL officials are prohibited from using or disclosing information relating to the beneficiary of a pending or approved petition for U nonimmigrant
        status unless the disclosure is made to a sworn officer or employee of DHS, the Department of Justice, or the Department of State for legitimate agency
        purposes, or in certain other limited circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. §214.14(e) and 8 U.S.C. § 1367. If a WHD official is uncertain as to whether it is
        permissible to disclose information to a particular party, SOL should be consulted for advice.

        IV. Conclusion

        Additional guidance and training concerning investigation protocols and the handling of Supplement B form certifications will be provided to WHD
        and RSOL staff, and shared with other DOL worker protection agencies that may also encounter U Visa issues.

        1. The certifying agency does not have to certify as to whether the petitioner suffered “substantial physical or mental abuse” as a result of the QCA.
        See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). This is a determination that will be made by USCIS based on information submitted by the petitioner. See 8 C.F.R. §
        214.14(b)(1) and (c)(2)(ii).

        2. The certifying agency does not have to certify as to whether the petitioner suffered “substantial physical or mental abuse” as a result of the QCA.
        This is a determination that will be made by USCIS based on information submitted by the petitioner. See 8 C.F.R. §214.14(b)(1) and (c)(2)(ii).

        3. If WHD receives a request to certify for any other QCA, the U Visa coordinator will work with the requestor to identify other federal and state
        agencies that may be willing to consider certifying the request.

                           Department of Labor U Visa Process and Protocols
                                                Question – Answer

What are U Visas?

U Nonimmigrant Visas (“U Visas”) were created by the Victims of Trafficking and Violence
Prevention Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-386). Victims of qualifying criminal activities who have
suffered substantial physical or mental abuse may apply for a U Visa if they are willing to assist law
enforcement or other government officials in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes.
Individuals who receive U visas may remain in the United States for up to four years, and may
eventually apply for permanent residency. Among other requirements, a U Visa petitioner must ask
a federal law enforcement agency or official to complete a certification form asserting that the U
Visa petitioner “has been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be helpful” in the investigation or
prosecution of the criminal activity. The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services, administers this program and grants or denies U Visa petitions.

What authority does the Department of Labor have to complete U Visa Certifications?

Department of Homeland Security regulations (8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(2)) expressly list certain
federal law enforcement agencies that may certify U Visa applications, including the Department of
Labor. In doing so, the Department of Homeland Security recognized that Department of Labor
investigators may detect evidence of qualifying criminal activity during the course of investigating
violations of workplace laws. The Department of Labor’s authority to complete U Visa
Certifications (Form I-918, Supplement B) is based on its role as a law enforcement agency that has
detected the crimes.

What is Form I-918, Supplement B, U Visa Certification?

Form I-918, Supplement B, U Visa Certification, is the specific form that a petitioner asks the
Department of Labor to complete and sign as part of his or her petition for a U Visa. The U Visa
Certification does not provide individuals with a U Visa; rather, certification of the form is a
required element in a U Visa petitioner’s petition to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In
completing the U Visa Certification, the agency must certify that the individual submitting the Form
I-918 is a victim of a certain qualifying criminal activity and is, has been, or is likely to be helpful
in the investigation or prosecution of that activity. The Department of Labor has developed
protocols to ensure the U Visa Certification process – the completion of the U Visa Certification –
is efficient and an effective enforcement tool.

What agency within the Department of Labor has authority to complete U Visa Certification
requests?

The authority to complete U Visa certifications has been delegated to the Wage and Hour Division.
The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcing some of the nation’s most comprehensive
federal labor laws, including the minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, the employment of
persons with disabilities, family and medical leave, the employment of temporary or seasonal
migrant workers, the use of lie detector tests, and prevailing wages for government service and
construction contracts. While the Wage and Hour Division does not investigate violations of
qualifying criminal activities, it does conduct investigations for minimum wage and overtime

                                                            1

                                                                            APPENDIX B1
violations. Because many wage and hour investigations take place in industries marked by
vulnerable workers, the Wage and Hour Division is often the first federal agency to make contact
with these workers and detect criminal activity in the workplace, which it may then refer to the
appropriate authorities. Additional agencies may be delegated authority where appropriate.

Where will the authority to certify rest within the Wage and Hour Division?

The certification process has been delegated to the Wage and Hour Division’s Regional
Administrators located in five cities around the country. These senior agency officials will have the
resources and training needed to make ultimate decisions about certification. Each official will be
assisted by a regional coordinator, who will have additional training to ensure that requests for
certification will be handled efficiently and effectively. Wage and Hour Division officials will work
closely with the regional offices of the Solicitor of Labor in the consideration of certification. The
final authority to complete U Visa Certifications will be delegated to the Regional Administrator.

What factors will the Wage and Hour Division consider in response to a request for completion
of a U Visa Certification?

The primary factors that will be considered include: 1.) whether the qualifying criminal activity
arises in the context of an employment relationship or work environment and there is a related,
credible allegation of a violation of a law the Department of Labor enforces; 2.) if the petitioner
alleges a qualifying criminal activity of involuntary servitude, peonage, trafficking, obstruction of
justice or witness tampering; 3.) the petitioner has demonstrated that he or she has been, is being, or
is likely to be helpful to law enforcement officials in any investigation or prosecution of the
qualifying criminal activity; 4.) if another law enforcement agency is already engaged in the
investigation of the qualifying criminal activity or would be in a better position to certify based on
the facts presented; and, 5.) whether completion of the U Visa Certification would assist the
Department’s investigation of a violation of a law that it enforces.

Will the Department of Labor certify U Visa petitions based upon qualifying criminal activities
that are unrelated to an investigation of a civil law under Wage and Hour Division jurisdiction?

No. The Wage and Hour Division will only certify for the five qualifying criminal activities
identified above when they are detected in the process of investigating an allegation of a civil law
under its jurisdiction, for example, the right to a minimum wage and overtime. The alleged
qualifying criminal activity must arise in the context of a work environment or an employment
relationship and there must be a related, credible allegation of a violation of a law that the
Department of Labor enforces.

Why has the Department identified five specific qualifying criminal activities for certification?

The Department of Labor has determined it will consider completing U Visa Certifications where it
has detected violations of any one of the following five qualifying criminal activities: involuntary
servitude, peonage, trafficking, obstruction of justice, or witness tampering. It is most efficient and
effective to train staff on the detection of these qualifying criminal activities, which are most likely
to be found in connection with the agency’s workplace investigations.

                                                                            APPENDIX B1
What should a petitioner and/or his or her representative expect when requesting certification of
a Supplement B form for a U Visa?

All requests for completion of a U Visa Certification will be directed to the regional coordinator. In
most cases the coordinator will interview the petitioner regarding their allegations to determine
whether or not the request meets the requisite factors identified to consider certification. The
petitioner’s underlying minimum wage or overtime complaint will be addressed according to the
Wage and Hour Division’s standard complaint policy. Should the coordinator determine that the
request is related to an ongoing Wage and Hour investigation, the coordinator will notify the
appropriate Wage and Hour Division investigator. The coordinator will work as appropriate with
colleagues in the Regional Solicitor of Labor’s office in consideration of the request. The
Department of Labor recognizes the importance of expeditious processing and timely responses and
intends to notify the petitioner and/or his or her representative of its decision in writing as soon as
possible.

The petitioner and/or his or her representative will be responsible for completing the remainder of
the U Visa petition and submitting needed information to the Department of Homeland Security’s
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Should the Department of Labor determine a
certification is appropriate, it will only complete one portion of the application, the Supplement B
certification. Once the U Visa Certification is complete, it must be returned to the petitioner, who
will then send it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the entire U Visa petition
package.

In some instances, it is possible that a Wage and Hour Division investigator will detect a qualifying
criminal activity during the course of an investigation. Should this occur, the Wage and Hour
Division investigator will provide information about the detection to the appropriate coordinator;
the coordinator and the Regional Administrator will decide how best to proceed given the facts and
circumstances of the case.

What should a petitioner expect if their request is denied?

If a decision is made not to certify the Supplement B form, the petitioner or their representative will
be informed of the decision in writing as soon as possible, along with information as to which other
law enforcement agencies may be able to certify the petition.

Is the Department obligated to complete every request for a U Visa Certification?

The U Visa Certification requires the Department of Labor to attest that the petitioner is a victim of
certain qualifying criminal activity, and is, has been, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation or
prosecution of that activity. The Department of Labor has established protocols that it will follow
when considering a request to complete a U Visa Certification. Completion of a U Visa
Certification is entirely discretionary.

Will the Department of Labor refer underlying qualifying criminal activities for prosecution?

The Wage and Hour Division will refer the underlying qualifying criminal activity to appropriate
law enforcement agencies in accordance with its normal referral procedure. The Wage and Hour
Division places paramount importance on the safety of a petitioner, his or her family, and other

                                                            3

                                                                            APPENDIX B1
individuals who have been harmed or who may be at risk. The timing and proper recipient of each
referral will be made on a case-by-case basis. Proper confidentiality procedures will be followed in
any referral.

How long does the Department of Labor expect the certification process to take?

The Department of Labor recognizes the importance of expeditious processing and timely
responses. The Department anticipates that it will take it three months to review a single U Visa
Certification request and make a determination as to whether or not to complete the Certification.
This timeframe will vary, however, depending upon the complexity of the case and the overall
volume of U Visa Certification requests the Department’s regional representatives are handling at
any one time. This estimated timeline may be adjusted based on the Department’s experience
reviewing certification requests under the procedures outlined. The Department intends to notify the
petitioner and/or his or her representative of its decision in writing as soon as possible.

Does the Department of Labor’s completion of a U Visa Certification result in the issuance of a
U Visa?

The Department of Labor, like other federal and state law enforcement agencies and the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission, has authority to complete the portion of a petitioner’s U-
Visa petition known as Supplement B, U Visa Certification. The Department of Labor does not
have the authority to issue a U Visa. The decision whether to approve or deny a U Visa petition
rests solely with the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services. There is a single, statutory, annual cap on the number of principal applicants who may be
admitted in U nonimmigrant status in any fiscal year, regardless of the origin of the certification.
The Department of Labor does not have a separate allotment of U Visas at its discretion.

What training will Wage and Hour Division employees be provided on U Visas?

Guidance and initial training concerning investigation protocols and the handling of Supplement B
form certifications has already been provided to certain key Wage and Hour Division and Regional
Solicitor of Labor staff. Further training is planned for the future. Guidance will be shared with
other Department of Labor worker protection agencies that may also encounter U Visa issues as
appropriate.

Will the Department of Labor review these processes and procedures?

The Wage and Hour Division will regularly evaluate protocols for effectiveness and efficiency.
Revisions may be made as deemed necessary.

SUBJECT: Updated Procedures in Addressing Immigration Status
                  Issues that Arise During NLRB Proceedings

This memorandum provides a brief introduction to immigration status issues, and an update
regarding how such issues should be addressed during NLRB investigations and proceedings.
The NLRA protects all employees covered by the Act regardless of immigration status;1
however, immigration status issues may affect remedies and occasionally present other practical
difficulties for the enforcement of the Act. Supplementing GC 02-06, this memorandum
provides further guidance for proceeding when immigration status issues arise during NLRB
case handling. It also identifies immigration agencies that have discretion to provide
immigration remedies and other assistance to discriminatees or witnesses in Board proceedings.
Regions should contact DAGC Peter Sung Ohr in the Division of Operations-Management
whenever issues arise that may require assistance from such immigration agencies as further
described below.

A. Background

     1. Immigration Agencies

Since the organization of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) in 2002, primary
responsibility for immigration issues has been split between three agencies within DHS:

    United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) is responsible for
       adjudicating immigration benefits, such as visas;

    Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) investigates immigration violations and
       enforces the law, including the prosecution of removal actions before immigration judges
       within the Department of Justice;

    Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) is responsible for securing the physical borders and
       points of entry.

Within the limits of the law, USCIS, ICE, and CBP have discretion to decide whether, when, and
how to enforce the law in each particular case coming within their respective jurisdictions. See
Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 483-87 (1999). In

1    Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883 (1984); see Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB, 535 U.S.

137, 152 (2002) (expressly reaffirming this principle, though limiting remedies in order to avoid conflict with

immigration law).

                                           APPENDIX B4
                                                       2

exercising this discretion, immigration agencies will consider, among other things, “[c]urrent or
past cooperation [by the individual] with . . . law enforcement authorities, such as the U.S.
Attorneys, the Department of Labor, or National Labor Relations Board, among others.”
Memorandum, “Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion,” Commissioner of Immigration and
Naturalization Services Doris Meissner, p. 8 (November 17, 2000); see also Memorandum,
“Civil Immigration Enforcement: Priorities for the Apprehension, Detention, and Removal of
Aliens,” Assistant Secretary of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement John Morton p. 4 (June
30, 2010); OM Memo 97-11 “Relations with Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) of
the U.S. Department of Justice” (February 14, 1997).

         2. Immigration Status
Non-citizens2 may hold one of two general categories of lawful visa status:

    Immigrant visas confer status as a Lawful Permanent Resident, colloquially referred to
       as a “green card.” Lawful Permanent Residents generally have work authorization. This
       status does not expire but can be terminated in a variety of circumstances, including
       certain criminal convictions.

    Nonimmigrant visas are temporary and will expire within a specific defined term. There
       are many varied types of nonimmigrant visas, most often named after the statutory
       subsection in the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), which creates each specific
       type. INA, Pub. L. 82-414, as amended, see 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. For example, the
       “H-2B visa” refers to the temporary worker visa governed by INA § 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b),
       (see below). The scope and nature of work authorization varies considerably among the
       nonimmigrant visas:
            o No work authorization is provided by many of the most common nonimmigrant
                visa types, including B-1 visas for business, B-2 visas for tourists and short term
                visitors covered by the visa waiver program (visitors from, for example, Japan,
                Czech Republic, Italy, England, etc.).
            o Limited work authorization is provided by a number of visas, particularly those
                obtained through work (rather than family or asylum). Such work authorization is
                limited to a specific employer; indeed, the visa itself is terminated if the
                employment relationship ends, and the former employee is then required by law
                to leave the country. Visas of this sort include H-1 visas for professionals, H-2B
                visas for nonprofessionals, and L visas for intracompany transferees.
            o Broader work authorization that permits working for any employer is provided
                by some visas, including portions of the term of some student visas, K-1 fiancée
                visas, and T, U, and S,3 law enforcement visas (described more fully below).

2  “All persons born or naturalized in the United States” are citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Citizens generally do not encounter immigration status issues when working in the United States.
3
   The S visa was created in 1994 as a temporary program and made permanent in 2001 require certification

by the Attorney General and are capped at 200 visas per year. They are available only for informants against

criminal organizations or enterprises. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(S)(i). An additional 50 visas are available where the

Secretary of State and the Attorney General provide certification for a reliable informant on terrorist organizations.

8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(S)(ii); 8 U.S.C. § 1184(k)(1).

   APPENDIX B4
                                                          3

Violations of visa terms—either by working when unauthorized or by “overstaying” after the
expiration of a visa—can result in loss of visa status and removal from the country. In addition,
entering the country without any valid immigration status violates immigration law and can
result in removal; such persons are commonly referred to as “undocumented.”

B. Procedure for Addressing Immigration Status Issues

As noted, the NLRA protects covered employees regardless of immigration status. Therefore,
immigration status (or lack thereof) is generally not relevant either in representation proceedings
or at the merits stage of unfair labor practice proceedings. As stated, in GC 02-06, “Procedures
and Remedies for Discriminatees Who May Be Undocumented Aliens after Hoffman Plastic
Compounds, Inc.” p. 6:

     Regions generally should presume that employees are lawfully authorized to work. They
         should refrain from conducting a sua sponte immigration investigation and should object
         to questions concerning the discriminatee's immigration status at the merits stage.

     Regions should investigate the discriminatee's immigration status only after a respondent
         establishes the existence of a genuine issue [during the remedial stage].

     Regions should conduct an investigation by asking the Union, the charging party and/or
         the discriminatee to respond to the employer's evidence.

Regions should continue to follow this policy and consult GC 02-06 for additional direction.

Nonetheless, immigration issues are sometimes unavoidably interjected into NLRB proceedings.
For example, NLRB discriminatees, witnesses, or voting-eligible employees may be taken into
custody by ICE or CBP. In addition, immigration status may be inextricably intertwined with an
unfair labor practice, such as where immigration threats or related conduct is the basis of the
unfair labor practice allegation. Finally, the issue may be as simple as an employee volunteering
information about immigration status or asking the Region for immigration advice or assistance.

Regions should not provide immigration advice. Resolution of these issues is best addressed
when employees can obtain immigration advice through their union or from an independent
immigration attorney. Regions may refer interested persons to the list of accredited immigration
services providers maintained by the Department of Justice and found at
http://www.justice.gov/eoir/statspub/raroster.htm.4 Individuals sometimes are mistaken about
their immigration status and Regions should not assume that immigration status information
volunteered by an unrepresented person is correct.

C. Seeking Assistance from Immigration Agencies Regarding Status Issues

As set forth below, in certain cases where immigration status is of particular significance, the
Agency may decide to seek the assistance of one of the three immigration agencies to advance

4  As a public service, the Region could place copies of the listing of currently recognized organizations and

accredited individuals in a binder in a designated area in the Regional office for the public’s use.

   APPENDIX B4
                                                          4

the effective enforcement of the NLRA. Such agencies might assist in providing visa remedies,
deferring immigration actions during the pendency of the NLRB proceeding, and/or releasing
individuals from custody or providing access to witnesses in custody. Regions should consult
with DAGC Peter Sung Ohr in the Division of Operations-Management when such issues arise.

Regions should also discuss with the Division of Operations-Management cases involving any of
the following circumstances: 1) where the status of an individual involved in the case is lost,
particularly because of protected concerted activities; 2) where the individual’s presence in the
country is important to the effectuation of the Act; 3) where NLRB or immigration processes are
being abused by the employer; and/or 4) where the employer knew or was willfully ignorant of
the employee’s lack of status. These circumstances are merely illustrative and there may be
others where consulting with the Division of Operations-Management would be prudent.

         1. Loss of Status, Particularly Where Status is Lost Because of Protected Concerted
Activities

Cases involving lawful immigration status that is illegally stripped from an employee as a direct
result of an unfair labor practice are very compelling. For example, as previously noted, an
employee holding a nonimmigrant work visa—such as the H or L visas—will be dependent upon
continued employment by a specific employer in order to maintain immigration status and
legally remain in the country. An employer who fired such an employee in violation of, for
example, Section 8(a)(1) or 8(a)(3), also would have unlawfully deprived the employee of visa
status. In addition, the investigation, prosecution, and remediation of the unfair labor practice
would likely be impeded by the discriminatee’s absence from the country. However, remaining
in the country to pursue the unfair labor practice could subject the discriminatee to immigration
penalties and could complicate remedial considerations—even though the employee had always
complied with immigration law and has been illegally deprived of immigration status.

In addition, cases where individuals lost lawful immigration status for any of a variety of other
reasons may also require assistance from immigration agencies in order to remain in the country
to participate in NLRB proceedings. This category includes those cases where there is simply
the expiration of a temporary nonimmigrant visa.

         2. Importance of the Individual’s Presence in the Country to the Effectuation of the
Act

Immigration status issues may interfere with enforcement and effectuation of the NLRA by, for
example, impacting the availability of discriminatees and important witnesses during NLRB
proceedings. In such cases, it may be appropriate to seek the assistance of immigration agencies.

In addition, particular attention is required where the alleged ULP involves egregious conduct,
such as physical coercion, involuntary servitude, blackmail, or violations of other laws.
Examples of physical coercion and involuntary servitude may include taking an employee’s
passport or imposing illegal working conditions. Examples of blackmail may include interfering
with protected activity through illegal threats of retaliation such as threats to call immigration
authorities or threats to “blacklist” employees. In such cases, additional immigration remedies

                                                                            APPENDIX B4
                                                          5

may be available, including a law enforcement visa such as the U or T Visa.5 It is very important
that Regions contact the Division of Operations-Management when such issues arise.

         T Visas:

The T Visa category was created in 2000 by the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection
Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106-386. This visa is available where the applicant is the victim of “severe
forms of trafficking in persons,”6 and the victim must be present in the United States because of
the trafficking. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(II). The victim must have either “complied with
any reasonable request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of acts of such
trafficking in persons, or [i]s less than 15 years of age.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)(i)(III).
Additionally, the victim must also prove “extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm”
if the victim were deported. 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(i) (describing evidentiary standard for extreme
hardship). There is also a numerical limit of 5000 T Visas per year.

T Visas last for a term of three years, and automatically include work authorization. 8 C.F.R.
§ 214.11(l)(4)(work authorization); § 214.11(p)(three year term). Family members of victims
can also obtain T Visas; family member T Visas are not subject to the numerical cap. 8 C.F.R.
§ 214.11(o). T Visas also include a path to becoming a lawful permanent resident. 8 C.F.R.
§ 214.11(p)(2).

This visa could be applicable in some cases that come before the NLRB. For example, where a
discriminatee is brought into the country under false pretenses and confined in sweatshop
conditions, a T Visa may be available. However, in most cases, T Visas may not be available
either because the individual came to the United States independent of any trafficking, or the
circumstances do not rise to the level of severe trafficking required by USCIS.

In those cases where a T Visa may be applicable, the Regional Office should immediately
contact DAGC Peter Sung Ohr in the Division of Operations-Management.

         U Visa:

Like the T Visa, the U Visa category was created by the Victims of Trafficking and Violence
Protection Act. The U Visa is available where the nonimmigrant applicant is the victim of one
the following “qualifying crimes” while in the United States:

         rape; torture; trafficking; incest; domestic violence; sexual assault; abusive sexual
         contact; prostitution; sexual exploitation; female genital mutilation; being held
         hostage; peonage; involuntary servitude; slave trade; kidnapping; abduction;
         unlawful criminal restraint; false imprisonment; blackmail; extortion;

5  Such visas are available to the victims of certain qualifying crimes who are cooperating with law

enforcement agencies. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T) & (U); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14.
6
   Defined as “sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in

which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or the recruitment, harboring,

transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion

for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.” 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a).

   APPENDIX B4
                                                          6

         manslaughter; murder; felonious assault; witness tampering; obstruction of
         justice; perjury; or attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any of the above
         mentioned crimes.

8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii).

Applicants for U Visas must submit a completed Form I-918, “Petition for U Nonimmigrant
Status” to USCIS for consideration, along with a completed and certified Supplement B form
completed by an agency responsible “for the detection, investigation, prosecution, conviction, or
sentencing of qualifying criminal activity.” See 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i); Instructions for I-
918, Supplement B at 2. In completing Supplement B, the agency must certify that the
individual submitting the Form I-918 is a victim of certain qualifying criminal activity and is, has
been, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of that activity. See 8 C.F.R. §
214.14(c)(2).

USCIS has interpreted this list of U Visa qualifying crimes broadly, and stated in the relevant
regulatory documents that this is a list “of general categories of criminal activity. It is also a
non-exclusive list. Any similar activity to the activities listed may be a qualifying criminal
activity.” New Classification for Victims of Criminal Activity; Eligibility for “U”
Nonimmigrant Status, Interim Final Rule, 72 F.R. 53014, 53018 (September 17, 2007).

If a Regional Office receives a request to complete the Supplemental B form to certify a U Visa
application, the Region should immediately contact DAGC Peter Sung Ohr in the Division of
Operations-Management. Initially, it will be the Regional Office’s responsibility to investigate
whether the nonimmigrant applicant has been a victim of a qualifying criminal activity and is
being, has been, or is likely to be helpful to the investigation of that activity. The qualifying
criminal activity must be related to the meritorious unfair labor practice alleged in the ULP under
investigation by the NLRB.

Upon the conclusion of the Regional investigation, the Region should submit a written
recommendation to the Division of Operations-Management addressing whether the ULP
allegation is related to the qualified criminal activity within the meaning of the U Visa statute
and whether the nonimmigrant applicant has demonstrated that he or she has been, is being, or is
likely to be helpful to the investigation.

The U Visa should be applicable in a greater number of cases than the T Visa because of the
breadth of the crimes which qualify. The list includes a number of crimes that may arise in the
workplace, and which also constitute unfair labor practices in some cases, including “peonage;
involuntary servitude; . . . unlawful criminal restraint; false imprisonment; blackmail; extortion;
. . . felonious assault; witness tampering; obstruction of justice; perjury; or attempt, conspiracy,
or solicitation to commit any of the above mentioned crimes.”

The remedy provided by the U Visa are substantially similar to those available with the T Visa: a

         3. Abuse of Process: Retaliation Using Immigration Status

Whether or not a T or U Visa may be available to an individual involved in a Board proceeding,
Regions should contact the Division of Operations-Management in cases where an employer is
taking advantage of immigration status issues in an attempt to abuse the NLRB process and
thwart the effective enforcement of the law. Examples of this type of behavior include calling or
threatening to call ICE in retaliation for protected concerted activities, citing immigration status
as a pretext for unlawful firing, and alluding to immigration status in a menacing or suggestive
way during representation or ULP proceedings.7

         4. Employer Knowledge or Willful Ignorance of Individuals Undocumented Status

Regions should also contact the Division of Operations-Management in cases where a
respondent employer commits ULPs against an employee knowing or with willful ignorance of
such employee’s lack of immigration work authorization. Such employers pose a significant
threat to the enforcement of the NLRA because they deliberately take advantage of the
employee’s lack of status. In most such cases, the employees are aware or suspect that the
employer knows of their immigration status, and are thus deterred from exercising their legal
rights even where no overt immigration threats are made.

The kind of evidence that demonstrates that an employer knew or was willfully ignorant of the
workers’ status includes: failure to ask for I-9 documents,8 complicity in accepting fraudulent I-9
documents, and irregular pay arrangements. Threats to take action based on status or other
statements acknowledging employees’ status also reflect a knowing or willfully ignorant
Employer.9

Conclusion

Although Regions should not raise immigration status issues sua sponte, in cases where such
issues arise, immigration agencies may grant immigration remedies or favorably exercise
discretion in order to assist the NLRB in the enforcement of the NLRA. Regions should contact
DAGC Peter Sung Ohr in the Division of Operations-Management in all cases where the
circumstances arguably justify using these mechanisms.

                                                May 6, 2010

1. SUBJECT: OBTAINING U VISAS IN INVESTIGATED CASES

2. PURPOSE: To set forth the procedures for certifying, under limited
         circumstances, requests for a “U Visa.”1

3. BACKGROUND: The federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act
         of 2000 created the U Visa, which is available to immigrant victims of serious
         crimes. The purpose behind the U Visa was to recognize that many
         undocumented crime victims fear that assisting law enforcement could lead to
         deportation. The U Visa encourages these victims to report crimes and assist in
         their prosecution by offering temporary legal status and work authorization. To
         obtain a U Visa, victims must demonstrate to the U.S. Citizenship and
         Immigration Services (USCIS), via certification by a law enforcement agency,
         their willingness to cooperate in a qualifying investigation or prosecution.

         Because the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) investigates
         claims under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and the Ralph Civil
         Rights Act, the DFEH may qualify as a law enforcement agency that can submit
         certifications to the USCIS on behalf of certain undocumented complainants.
         There are, however, several factors which would need to be present before
         DFEH could submit a U Visa certification.

4. PROCEDURES:

         A. When a U Visa is Appropriate:

                   1) The first step in determining when a U Visa certification is
                           appropriate would be that the case under investigation would have
                           to allege acts covered under the FEHA or Ralph Act and where the
                           allegations, if proven, would fall into one of the offenses covered by
                           the U Visa program:2

                           a) Sexual Assault;
                           b) Sexual Exploitation;
                           c) Abusive Sexual Contact;,

1 This Directive may be applied to U Visas created by future amendments to the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act.

DIR 317  -1-                            05/06/10

         APPENDIX B5
                  d) Rape;
                  e) Trafficking;
                  f) Domestic Violence;
                  g) Murder;
                  h) Manslaughter;
                  i) Abduction;
                  j) Extortion;
                  k) Torture;
                  l) Incest; and
                  m) Prostitution.

         2) The DFEH would have to be conducting an ongoing investigation
                  into the complainant’s FEHA or Ralph Act claim.

         3) The complainant would either have to be cooperating or willing to
                  cooperate in DFEH’s investigation.

         4) The complainant would have to request DFEH to submit the U Visa
                  certification on his or her behalf.

B. Submitting the request for U Visa Certification:

          1) If all the factors listed in 4. (A) (1-4) are present, the DFEH can, and
                  should, prepare and submit a law enforcement certification form
                  (Attached Form I-918, Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status
                  Certification) to USCIS.

           2) The Consultant should fill out the form including:

                  a) Details of the crime;
                  b) Complainant’s personal data;
                  c) Knowledge of the incident; and
                  d) Helpfulness to the investigation or prosecution.

            3) The Consultant should sign the form. Signing the form would not
                  indicate the DFEH’s sponsorship for the complainant/immigrant,
                  and the DFEH may, and should, notify USCIS if the complainant
                  failed to meet his or her ongoing responsibility to cooperate with the
                  Department. Accordingly, while the DFEH’s participation in this
                  federal immigration program will likely be limited, a U Visa
                  certification by the DFEH may, in certain circumstances, provide
                  the Enforcement Division with another effective tool to ensure the
                  thorough investigation of alleged FEHA or Ralph Act violations.

          4) DFEH staff members are not to question complainants regarding their
               immigration status. The Department’s new U Visa Practice does not
               change this approach. However, if a complainant voluntarily raises
               his or her immigration status with DFEH staff, and DFEH staff
               believes that pursuing a U Visa for the complainant would be

                         Administrator, Deputy Director, or Chief of Enforcement. The Chief of
                         Enforcement will review any certification before it is submitted to
                         USCIS.

                         NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
MEMORANDUM & ORDER REGARDING CERTIFICATION OF U VISA PETITIONS

1. PURPOSE

The purpose of this order is to establish guidelines and procedures for U visa certifications
signed by the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL).1

2. BACKGROUND

Congress created the U visa in 2000 in recognition of the fact that many undocumented
immigrant crime victims do not cooperate with law enforcement out of fear that such contact
could lead to their deportation. The U visa encourages these victims to report crimes and
cooperate in criminal investigations by offering temporary legal status and work authorization.
The U visa was created with the express purpose of strengthening the ability of law enforcement
agencies to detect, investigate and prosecute crimes committed against undocumented
immigrants, while simultaneously offering protection to the victims.

While it is the policy of the NYSDOL not to inquire into the immigration status of claimants or
witnesses, or to share witness information with the immigration authorities, the NYSDOL
recognizes that undocumented victims of labor-related criminal offenses may nevertheless be
reluctant to assist in the investigation or prosecution of that criminal activity out of fear of
deportation. The U visa allows the NYSDOL to more aggressively pursue perpetrators of
criminal labor violations while building trust in immigrant communities.

3. THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS AN APPROPRIATE
    CERTIFYING AGENCY

Crime victims applying for a U visa must submit a certification completed by a law enforcement
agency to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) affirming that the
applicant has been, is being, or is likely to be helpful to that agency in the investigation or
prosecution of the criminal activity. As a state law enforcement agency with the jurisdiction to
detect and/or investigate certain U visa-qualifying crimes under the New York State Labor Law,
the NYSDOL is an appropriate U visa certifying agency.

1 This order may be applied to U visas created by future amendments to relevant immigration statutes.

APPENDIX B8
4. PROCEDURE

a. WHEN A U VISA IS APPROPRIATE

i. The NYSDOL must have jurisdiction to investigate the case (i.e., the case
   must contain allegations of violations of New York State Labor Law) and the
   allegations, if proven, must make the claimant a victim of one of the offenses
   listed in the U visa statute. These offenses include

Rape                    Being held hostage     Manslaughter
Torture                 Peonage                Murder
Trafficking             Involuntary servitude  Felonious assault
Incest                  Slave trade            Witness tampering
Domestic violence       Kidnapping             Obstruction of justice
Sexual assault          Abduction              Perjury
Abusive sexual contact  Unlawful criminal      Attempt, conspiracy, or
Prostitution            restraint              solicitation to commit
Sexual exploitation     False imprisonment     any of the above
Female genital          Blackmail              mentioned crimes
mutilation              Extortion

The above list of qualifying criminal activities is a list of “general categories” of
qualifying crimes which are not tied to any particular statutory definition. The list
is not exhaustive and similar activities may serve as qualifying criminal activity
where the nature and elements of the offenses are substantially similar to offenses
included in the list.

ii. The request for certification must be submitted at any time during, or within a
    reasonable time after the conclusion of, the NYSDOL’s investigation or
    involvement in the detection of the qualifying crime.

iii. The potential U visa applicant must currently be, have been, or be likely to be
     helpful in the NYSDOL’s investigation. The individual must have actually
     provided, or be willing to provide, relevant testimony to the NYSDOL during
     its investigation, even if that testimony is not subsequently used at trial. There
     is no requirement that the crime be charged or prosecuted; if the case is
     prosecuted there is no requirement that the victim testify or the perpetrator be
     convicted.

                        APPENDIX B8
         b. SUBMITTING A REQUEST FOR U VISA CERTIFICATION

         If all the factors listed in Section 4(a)(i) through (iii) are present, the NYSDOL may
         prepare a law enforcement certification form (USCIS Form I-918, Supplement B, U
         Nonimmigrant Status Certification) for the claimant/witness’ submission to the USCIS.

                  i. PROCEDURE

                           1. The Commissioner of Labor may delegate her/his authority to issue U
                               visa certifications on behalf of the NYSDOL.2

                           2. Claimants or witnesses in a NYSDOL investigation who believe they
                               have been victims of a qualifying criminal activity and are being, have
                               been, or are likely to be helpful to the NYSDOL detection or
                               investigation of that criminal activity may submit a request for U Visa
                               certification to the Commissioner of Labor or her/his designee.

                           3. In submitting the request for U visa certification, the claimant or
                               witness should include the NYSDOL claim number and the name of
                               any NYSDOL staff involved in the claim, if known. The claimant or
                               witness should also fill out as much of the certification form (USCIS
                               Form I-918, Supplement B) as possible, including:

                                    a. The victim’s personal data;
                                    b. The details of the crime, including

                                              i. Any known dates,
                                             ii. A description of the criminal activity being investigated

                                                  and the victim’s knowledge of and involvement in the
                                                  investigation, and
                                            iii. A description of any known or documented injuries to
                                                  the victim, including physical or mental abuse; and
                                    c. The victim’s statement as to his or her helpfulness in the
                                        investigation and/or prosecution of the criminal activity.

                               Claimants or witnesses may attach additional pages as necessary,
                               including copies of any relevant reports or findings.

2 Please refer to Letter of designation of certifying authority.

                                                                            APPENDIX B8
                           4. Requests for U Visa certification will also be accepted from advocates
                               representing NYSDOL claimants or witnesses. For the NYSDOL to
                               communicate with said advocate regarding the claim and/or the
                               request for U Visa certification, the claimant or witness should submit
                               a written statement to the NYSDOL authorizing the NYSDOL to
                               communicate directly with the advocate.

5. TIMELINE

In order to protect eligible victims from deportation, certifications should be sought as soon as
potential applicants meet the eligibility requirements listed in Section 4(a).

The individual designated by the Commissioner to issue U visa certifications shall issue or deny
a certification as soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days from the date the request was
received.

6. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

         a. NYSDOL enforces New York’s Labor Laws regardless of the immigration status of
             any individuals involved. NYSDOL staff will not question claimants or witnesses
             about their immigration status, unless it is to discuss the possibility of a U Visa
             certification. Pursuant to Sec. 4(b)(i)(3) of this order, NYSDOL staff will not discuss
             the possibility of U Visa certifications with claimants or witnesses until after
             receiving authorization to do so from a supervisor, who would have by then discussed
             the matter with the Commissioner of Labor or her/his designee. In any conversation
             regarding the possibility of U Visa certification, NYSDOL staff shall explain to the
             claimant or witness that NYSDOL does not make referrals to the USCIS or ICE.
             Under no circumstances will NYSDOL staff give immigration legal advice to any
             victim.

         b. The role of the NYSDOL in the U Visa process is to certify the helpfulness of the
             claimant or witness in the NYSDOL investigation, not to determine the applicant’s
             eligibility for a U visa or whether the applicant has suffered sufficient harm to merit a
             visa. USCIS will adjudicate the U Visa petition.

         c. In addition to direct victims, the U Visa encompasses certain indirect victims, such as
             the victims of witness tampering, obstruction of justice and perjury, which are not
             crimes against a person. The claimant or witness may be considered a victim of

                                                                            APPENDIX B8
    witness tampering, obstruction of justice, or perjury, including any attempt,
    conspiracy, or solicitation to commit one or more of those offenses if:

         i. The victim has been directly and proximately harmed by the perpetrator of the
             witness tampering, obstruction of justice, or perjury; and

        ii. There are reasonable grounds to conclude that the perpetrator committed the
             witness tampering, obstruction of justice, or perjury offense, at least in
             principal part, as a means:
                  1. To avoid or frustrate efforts to investigate, arrest, prosecute, or
                      otherwise bring to justice the perpetrator for other criminal activity; or
                  2. To further the perpetrator's abuse or exploitation of or undue control
                      over the petitioner through manipulation of the legal system.

d. If the victim unreasonably refuses to assist in the investigation or prosecution of the
    qualifying criminal activity of which he or she is a victim, even after the certification
    has been submitted to the USCIS, the NYSDOL may notify the USCIS by sending a

                                               CERTIFICATION

    For the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court

certify that moving Plaintiff  “has been helpful, is being helpful, or

likely will be helpful” in the investigation or prosecution of Defendants’ violations of

NMSA 1978 § 30-24-3 (Intimidation of a Witness), NMSA 1978 § 30-25-1 (Perjury) and

NMSA 1978 § 30-22-5 (Tampering with Evidence). Such judicial certification would

allow Plaintiff to petition the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) for U

visa relief, which – if granted – would permit him to remain in the United States to

complete presentation of his claims brought pursuant to the New Mexico Minimum

Wage Act (NMSA § 50-4-1et seq.) and the above-listed criminal charges.

I. Procedural History

        Plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit on          on their own behalf and on

behalf of a class of similarly-situated employees to recover unpaid minimum and

overtime wages they are owed by Defendants. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs also allege

that Defendants unlawfully retaliated against Plaintiff  by terminating his

employment when he attempted to recover the wages he is owed. Plaintiffs filed their

Motion to Proceed as a Collective Action on              Defendants filed a Motion to

Compel Discovery on                Both Motions are currently pending before the

Court.

II. This Court Should Certify Plaintiff Soy Lopes’ Application for U Visa Relief.

        A. Plaintiff   Offers a Preliminary Showing that He Is Qualified for

        a Nonimmigrant U Visa.

        Congress created the U visa program with the passage of the Victims of

Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act of 2000 (“TVPA”). See Pub. L. No. 106-386, §

1513, 114 Stat. 1464, 1533-37; see also 72 FR 53014-15. The purpose of the U visa

program is to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and

prosecute crimes enumerated in the TVPA (which include witness tampering,

obstruction of justice and perjury) by granting qualifying witnesses to those crimes

nonimmigrant status to remain in the United States to assist law enforcement in the

investigation or prosecution of such crimes. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii); 72 Fed. Reg.

53014-15 (“Alien victims may not have legal status and, therefore may be reluctant to

help in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity for fear of removal from the

United States.”) (“Congress also sought to encourage law enforcement officials to better

serve immigrant crime victims.”).

                                   -2-

                                   APPENDIX B11
To be eligible for U visa relief, a person (1) must have “suffered substantial

physical or mental abuse as a result of having been a victim of [a] criminal activity”

enumerated by the Act; (2) must “posses[] information” concerning the qualifying

criminal activity; and (3) must have “been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be

helpful” in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal act. See 8 U.S.C. §

1101(a)(15)(U)(i). The TVPA’s qualifying criminal acts include, inter alia: (1) witness

tampering; (2) obstruction of justice; and (3) perjury, as well as “any similar activity in

violation of federal, state, or local criminal law.” See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii).

i. Plaintiff               Is A Victim of Witness Intimidation.

In New Mexico, the crime of Intimidation of a Witness is committed when any

person knowingly:

intimidat[es] or threaten[s] any witness or person likely to become a
witness in any judicial, administrative, legislative or other official
cause or proceeding for the purpose of preventing such individual
from testifying to any fact, to abstain from testifying or to testify
falsely…

NMSA 1978 § 30-24-3(A)(2)

It is not necessary that a judicial proceeding be underway when an act of

intimidation occurs for criminal liability to adhere to a defendant who intimidates a

witness. State v. Clements, 146 N.M. 745, 749 (N.M. App. 2009); certiorari denied 147

N.M. 362. (Statute criminalizing intimidation of a witness does not require that a judicial

proceeding be instituted at the time defendant engaged in the improper intimidation of a

“person likely to become a witness in any judicial proceeding.”). Further, proof that the

potential witness was actually intimidated is not required -- it is the defendant’s intent to

intimidate that is queried. State v. Fernandez, 117 N.M. 673, 679-680 (N.M. App. 1994).

                           -3-

                           APPENDIX B11
Here, on                   , Plaintiff                        delivered to Defendants a letter

declaring that he and other workers at the                    had formed a “workers

committee” to attempt to resolve a series of problems that these employees were

experiencing in the workplace. See Pl. Ex. 1, Letter to               ,

Plaintiff                  wrote to Defendants that “[t]he most pressing of these

problems is that some of us are not being paid the city minimum wage of $9.85 or

overtime pay.” Id. In response, Defendants summarily terminated Mr.
employment.2

Defendants violated the criminal anti-retaliation provisions of the New Mexico

Minimum Wage Act (NMSA 1978 §§ 50-4-26(A), 50-4-26.1) and the federal Fair Labor

Standards Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 215, 216) when they terminated Plaintiff                        in

retaliation for bringing forth his wage claim. Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance

Plastics Corp., 131 S. Ct. 1325 (2011) (Employers are prohibited from retaliating against

employees for making informal, non-judicial and non-administrative complaints

regarding unpaid wages.).

Defendants also committed an act of witness intimidation in violation of NMSA §

1978 30-24-3(A)(2) when they terminated Plaintiff             ’ employment. Defendants

did so by demonstrating to Plaintiff            that, should he pursue his wage claims,

they would take action against him. Though Defendants did not directly inform Plaintiff

that they fired him in order to prevent him from pursuing and testifying in a

wage case, such proof is not required. State v. McGee, 2003, 135 N.M. 73, 77 (Proof of

defendant's intent to retaliate or to exact “pay back,” for purposes of offense of

2 The other signatory to the letter, Plaintiff  had already terminated his employment with
Defendants when the letter was delivered.
                                                -4-

                                                APPENDIX B11
retaliation against a witness, is rarely provable by direct evidence, and thus

circumstantial evidence must often be relied upon for its proof.) Indeed, Defendants’

message was clear: Should Plaintiff     seek to recover the wages he worked

for, Defendants would (and did) take action against him. Thus, Defendants violated

NMSA § 1978 30-24-3(A)(2) when they terminated Plaintiff              employment in

an attempt to prevent him from participating in the instant lawsuit.

ii. Plaintiff                           Is A Victim of Tampering with Evidence.

Tampering with evidence consists of destroying, changing, hiding, placing or

fabricating any physical evidence with intent to prevent the apprehension, prosecution
or conviction of any person…3 NMSA 1978 § 30-22-5. In a prosecution for tampering

with evidence, when there is no other evidence of the specific intent to disrupt an

investigation, intent is often inferred from an overt act of the defendant. State v. Garcia,

149 N.M. 185, 192 (2011) (“[Defendant’s] multiple overt acts made clear his intent to

thwart law enforcement by jettisoning key evidence.”).

Here, Defendants sought to evade civil and criminal liability for failing to pay their

employees minimum and overtime wages by “discarding” records of their employees’

hours worked. See Pl. Ex. 2, Letter to  , dated                       . They did so

despite the fact that they were required by law to maintain such records. NMSA 1978 §

50-4-9. When Defendants destroyed what would be the key evidence in an

investigation/prosecution of civil and criminal violations of the New Mexico Minimum

3 Failure to pay wages owed is a criminal offense. NSMA 1978 §50-4-26(A) (“An employer who violates
any of the provisions of the Minimum Wage Act is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be
sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-19-1 NMSA 1978.”).

                                                        -5-

                                                                           APPENDIX B11
Wage Act, they made clear their intent to thwart law enforcement, and thus committed

an act of Tampering with Evidence.

     Similarly, Defendants falsified wage records submitted to the New Mexico

Department of Workforce Solutions (“DWS”) in an attempt to evade law enforcement

notice of their criminal refusal to pay wages for hours worked. Compare Pl. Ex. 3,

“Employer’s Quarterly Wage and Contribution Reports” submitted by Defendants to

DWS with Pl. Ex. 4, Plaintiff           ’ records of hours worked. For example, in the

fiscal quarter running from             through                , Plaintiff

     earned approximately $             in wages. For this period, Defendants reported

to DWS that they paid only $            in wages to Plaintiff  Similarly, during

the  through                                 quarter, Defendants reported to the State

of New Mexico that they paid Plaintiff       $ in wages when they in fact paid

him approximately $            in wages. Defendants thus committed another act of

Tampering with Evidence.

     iii. Plaintiff                     is a Victim of Defendants’ Perjury.

     A person commits an unlawful act of perjury when they make “a false statement

under oath, affirmation or penalty of perjury, material to the issue or matter involved in

the course of any judicial, administrative, legislative or other official proceeding or

matter, knowing such statement to be untrue.” NMSA 1978 § 30-25-1; State v.

Gallegos, 98 N.M. 31, 31 (NM. App. 1982) overruled on other grounds by State v.

Benavidez, 127 N.M. 189 (1999).

     In New Mexico, employers are required to submit quarterly “Wage and

Contribution” reports to the Department of Workforce Solutions wherein each employer

                                        -6-

                                    APPENDIX B11
must certify the wages paid to its employees for that quarter so that the State can

determine each employer’s Unemployment Insurance tax responsibility. See NMSA

1978 § 51-1-9; NMAC 11.3.400 et seq. Employers are required to sign the Wage and

Contribution reports that they submit. NMAC 11.3.400.404.B. When such reports are

signed, the employer certifies that the report “is true and correct according to law and

department regulations…” See Pl. Ex. 3, “Employer’s Quarterly Wage and Contribution

Reports” submitted by Defendants.

In this case, Defendants paid Plaintiff              in cash, “off-the-books” during

much of his tenure and thus committed perjury when they submitted reports to the New

Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions that vastly under-reported the wages paid to

Plaintiff         Compare Pl. Ex. 3 with Pl. Ex. 4. For example, in the fiscal quarter

running from                     through             , Plaintiff            earned

approximately $   in wages. For this period, Defendants reported to DWS that

they paid only $  in wages to Plaintiff              Similarly, during the

                                   quarter, Defendants reported to the State of New

Mexico that they paid Plaintiff           $ in wages when they in fact paid him

approximately $   in wages. Defendants thus committed acts of perjury when

they submitted sworn and untruthful reports to DWS.

B. Plaintiff                     Suffered Substantial Mental Abuse as a Result of

           Defendants’ Crimes.

To be eligible for U visa relief, an alien must have “suffered substantial physical

or mental abuse as a result of having been a victim of criminal activity” enumerated by

the Act. See 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(15)(U)(iii)(1). To determine whether suffered abuse is

substantial, a number of factors may be considered, including:

                                          -7-

                                   APPENDIX B11
       The nature of the injury inflicted or suffered; the severity of the
       perpetrator’s conduct; the severity of the harm suffered; the
       duration of the infliction of the harm; and the extent to which there
       is permanent or serious harm to the appearance, health or physical
       or mental soundness of the victim… A series of acts taken together
       may be considered substantial physical or mental abuse even
       where no single act alone rises to that level.

       8 C.F.R. §214.14(b). Ultimately, the determination for eligibility for U visa interim

relief, is made by USCIS on a “case-by-case [basis], using [these] factors as

guidelines… Through these factors, USCIS will be able to evaluate the kind and degree

of harm suffered by the individual applicant, based upon the applicant’s experience.” 72

FR 53018.

       Plaintiff  suffered substantial mental abuse as a result of Defendants’

criminal activities. In her attached evaluation, Licensed Psychotherapist

       , LPCC, describes how, after Plaintiff         was unlawfully terminated from

his employment, he “fell into a deep depression and anxiety regarding his inability to

acquire any work and support his family.” See Pl. Ex. 5, Psychotherapist evaluation

dated             . The psychotherapist notes that “[Plaintiff                ] was

angry at himself” and that “he questioned himself for having reported the exploitation.”

Id. She notes that “[h]e would feel so bad that he often cried alone during the day” and

that “[w]hen his family returned for the day, he would be distraught, listless and not

willing or able to take part in their activities. He did not want anything to do with others.”

Id.

       The psychotherapist goes on to note that “Mr.  had a history of experience

with peonage, and he found himself trapped in it again. It recently took him over two

years to finally decide to try to do something about it. His efforts only resulted in his

                  -8-

                  APPENDIX B11
being fired.” Id. The psychotherapist describes how Plaintiff             “felt like he

would rather give up trying than continue to live in that exploitative manner” and that

“[h]e lost his appetite since all food was tasteless to him.” The report finds that “

continues to feel the effects of the long-term exploitation by his former employers” and

that “[h]e often feels that he will never be able to overcome the struggles that have

stemmed from his abusive financial and emotional exploitation.” Id.

C. Plaintiff            Possesses Information about Defendants’

Involvement in the Crimes of Intimidation of a Witness, Tampering with

Evidence and Perjury.

To receive U visa relief, a person must “possess[] information” concerning the

alleged criminal activity. See 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(15)(U)(i)(II); see also 8 C.F.R. §

214.14(b)(2) (the petitioner must have “knowledge of the details” and “possess specific

facts” sufficient to show that the petitioner “has, is, or is likely” to assist in the

prosecution of the crimes.) Because Plaintiff         is the principal witness to the

circumstances of his unlawful termination and his actual hours worked, he possesses

information about Defendants’ commission of the crimes of Witness Intimidation,

Tampering with Evidence and Perjury described above.

D. Plaintiff         Will Be Helpful in the Investigation and Prosecution

of Defendants’ Crimes.

The final requirement for U visa relief is that the petitioner “has been helpful, is

being helpful, or is likely to be helpful” to the law enforcement agency or judge

investigating or prosecuting the crime. See 8 U.S.C. §1101(a)(15)(U)(i).

Here, Plaintiffs have brought their charges before the Santa Fe County District

Attorney. Plaintiff  will make himself available to the district attorney should

                              -9-

                        APPENDIX B11
she initiate an investigation. If criminal prosecution ensues, Plaintiff     will

assist the district attorney in any way requested.

III. This Court May Certify that Plaintiff                        Is Assisting or Will

           Assist in the Investigation of Defendants’ Crimes.

As set forth above, a person applying for U nonimmigrant status must provide a

certification from a law enforcement official or judge that the person “has been helpful, is

being helpful, or is likely to be helpful” in the investigation or prosecution of an

enumerated crime. See 8 U.S.C. §1184(p)(1). State court judges may certify U visa

applications. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(i)(III); 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(3)(ii); Garcia v.

Audubon Communities Mgmt., LLC, 2008 WL 1774584 *2 (E.D. La. 2008). Above,

Plaintiff  makes a prima facie showing that he will be eligible for U visa relief

because he is the victim of enumerated crimes, has suffered substantial mental abuse

as a result of those crimes, and he is being and will be helpful in the investigation and

prosecution of those crimes.

Where a petitioner makes a prima facie showing that they will be eligible for U

visa relief, USCIS regulations direct the certifying official to complete and sign Form I-

918 Supplement B, “U Nonimmigrant Status Certification.” See 8 C.F.R. §

214.14(c)(2)(i). A proposed completed Form I-918 is attached hereto       .

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff          respectfully requests that the Court grant

Plaintiffs’ Motion for U Visa Certification and sign  Form I-918, so that Plaintiff

Soy Lopes may apply to the USCIS for nonimmigrant U visa relief.

Re: Request for U-Visa Certification – MM
         Employer: KMM1

Dear ,

         I am writing on behalf of MM for whom I requested a U-Visa Certification pursuant to
the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) Field Assistance Bulletin and U-Visa Process and
Protocols.2 Ms. M alleged the qualifying criminal activity of fraud in foreign labor contracting,
which arose in the context of her employment with Mr. M. During a telephone conversation on
October 24, 2013, you alerted me to the likelihood that the USDOL will narrowly interpret the
fraud in foreign labor criminal statute as to apply only to contracting that occurred on U.S. soil,
thereby curtailing the USDOL’s ability to certify U-Visas under this qualifying criminal activity
for a broad range of exploitative and unlawful behavior. Such an interpretation is contrary to
established case law, would constrain the scope of the law, and would exclude a significant
population of vulnerable and exploited workers from immigration remedies to which they are
entitled.

    I. BACKGROUND ON FRAUD IN FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTING

         The 2008 Reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act created a new
federal criminal activity of fraud in foreign labor contracting. 18 U.S.C. § 1351. Violations are
punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years. One engages in fraud in foreign labor
contracting when an individual “knowingly and with intent to defraud recruits, solicits, or hires a
person outside the United States or causes another person to recruit, solicit, or hire a person
outside the United States, or attempts to do so, for purposes of employment in the United States
by means of materially false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises regarding that

    II. THE FRAUD IN FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTING STATUTE PROVIDES
             FOR EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION.

             A. Federal Criminal Statutes May Have Extraterritorial Reach Even Where It
                  Is Not Explicitly Articulated In The Statute.

         It is well-settled that federal criminal statutes may be interpreted to provide for
extraterritorial effect even when it is not specifically articulated in the statutory language itself.
In United States v. Bowman, 260 U.S. 94 (1922), the Supreme Court held that a presumption
against extraterritoriality is not appropriate for certain criminal statutes “which are, as a class, not
logically dependent on their locality for the government’s jurisdiction, but are enacted because of
the right of the government to defend itself against obstruction, or fraud wherever perpetrated.”
Bowman, 260 U.S. at 97-98. As numerous federal courts of appeals have recognized, “Bowman
established the rule that Congress need not expressly provide for extraterritorial application of a
criminal statute if the nature of the offense is such that it may be inferred.” United States v.
Plummer, 221 F.3d 1298, 1304-1305 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v. McAllister, 160
F.3d 1304, 1307-08 (11th Cir. 1998), reh'g and reh'g en banc denied, 176 F.3d 496 (11th Cir.
1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 853 (1999)).

         Relying on Bowman, courts across the country have routinely inferred congressional
intent to provide for extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign offenses that cause domestic harm.
See, e.g., United States v. Kapordelis, 569 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir. 2009) (production of child
pornography photographs abroad); United States v. Benitez, 741 F.2d 1312, 1316-17 (11th Cir.
1984) (conspiracy to murder government agents and assault of government agents abroad);
United States v. Perez-Herrera, 610 F.2d 289, 290 (5th Cir. 1980) (attempt to import marijuana
into the United States); United States v. Baker, 609 F.2d 134, 137-39 (5th Cir. 1980) (possession
with intent to distribute and conspiracy to import marijuana); see also United States v. Vasquez-
Velasco, 15 F.3d 833, 839 n.4 (9th Cir. 1994) (murder abroad to further a drug-trafficking
enterprise); United States v. Harvey, 2 F.3d 1318, 1329 (3d Cir. 1993) (possession of child
pornography made abroad); United States v. Felix-Gutierrez, 940 F.2d 1200, 1204 (9th Cir.
1991) (accessory after-the-fact to kidnapping and murder of government agent abroad); Chua
Han Mow v. United States, 730 F.2d 1308, 1311 (9th Cir. 1984) (conspiracy to import drugs into
the United States).

         The Supreme Court’s decision in EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Company, 499 U.S.
244 (1991) – which held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not have
extraterritorial reach because it lacks a clear Congressional statement on the matter – does not
change the Bowman analysis as it applies to criminal statutes. See Plummer, 221 F.3d at 1305,
n.4; United States v. Dawn, 129 F.3d 878, 882 n. 7 (7th Cir. 1997) (“Bowman recognizes an
exception to the presumption against extraterritorial intent for ‘criminal statutes …’”); Kollias v.
D & G Marine Maint., 29 F.3d 67, 71 (2d Cir. 1994).

                                                                2	  
	  

                                                                           APPENDIX B12
             B. The Plain Language of the Statute Clearly Demonstrates Congressional
                  Intent for Extraterritorial Jurisdiction.

         The statute’s title, “Fraud in Foreign Labor Contracting,” and statutory provisions that
provide for the “hiring of a person outside the United States” demonstrate clear intent of
extraterritorial jurisdiction.3 Courts have confirmed Congressional intent to provide for
extraterritoriality of criminal statutes with similar language. See Pasquantino v. United States,
544 U.S. 349, 371-72 (2005) (noting that the federal criminal wire fraud statute’s prohibition of
frauds executed “in interstate or foreign commerce” indicates that “this is surely not a statute in
which Congress had only domestic concerns in mind” (internal quotation marks omitted));
United States v. Clark, 435 F.3d 1100, 1106 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding extraterritorial jurisdiction
of statute titled “Engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places” and reaching people “who
travel[] in foreign commerce”); see also United States v. Weingarten, 632 F.3d 60, 66 (2d. Cir.
2011). The statute’s plain language, which describes the international scope of the unlawful act
as the “hiring of a person outside the United States . . . for purposes of employment in the United
States by means of materially false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises,” clearly
demonstrates Congress’s intent to prohibit acts that are not only of “domestic concerns.”
Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 371.

         Beyond the plain extraterritorial language in the fraud in foreign labor contracting
criminal statute, an intention of extraterritoriality “may be ‘inferred from . . . the nature of the
harm the statute is designed to prevent,’ from the self-evident ‘international focus of the statute,’
and from the fact that ‘limit[ing] [the statute’s] prohibitions to acts occurring within the United
States would undermine the statute’s effectiveness.’” United States v. Belfast, 611 F.3d 783,
810-811 (11th Cir. 2010) (quoting Plummer, 221 F.3d at 1310). It is hard to dispute that the
fraud in foreign labor contracting statute has anything but an “international focus.” Further, one
can easily infer an intention of extraterritoriality based on the harm the statute intends to prohibit,
the practice of recruiting foreign workers, in their home countries, with promises of fair working
conditions and wages, only to exploit them after they have arrived in the United States. The
fraud in foreign labor contracting criminal statute was passed to address this common and
inhumane practice. 154 Cong. Rec. H10904 (Dec 10, 2008). In an explanatory statement drafted
by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, Representative Berman explained
that the primary purpose of the fraud in foreign contracting provision was to create
accountability for employers who “lured” people to the United States under false pretenses,
particularly under guest visa programs. To limit its reach to domestic contracting only would
significantly “undermine the statute’s effectiveness,” and run counter to the purpose articulated
by lawmakers. Id.

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 	   

3  By comparison, the 2008 Amendments to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act

established extraterritorial jurisdiction over certain peonage and trafficking offenses that are

otherwise inherently domestic crimes and contain no reference to extraterritoriality. See 18

U.S.C. § 1581 (peonage); 1583 (enticement into slavery); 1584 (sale into involuntary servitude);

1589 (forced labor); 1590 (human trafficking); 1591 (sex trafficking).

                                                                3	  
	  

                                                                           APPENDIX B12
         Because the statute’s language, intent, and legislative history assume extraterritorial
jurisdiction, the U-Visa regulations’ requirement that the “qualifying criminal activity occurred
in the United States . . . or violated a U.S. federal law that provides for extraterritorial
jurisdiction to prosecute the offense in a U.S. federal court” is met. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b)(4)
(emphasis added).4 Indeed, in at least one instance, criminal defendants were convicted in
federal court under this statute without question as to the extraterritorial application of the
statute. United States v. Askarkhodjaev, 09-00143-01-CR-W-ODS (W.D. Mo.).

   III. MS. M, A VICTIM OF FRAUD IN FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTING,
            EXPERIENCED THE KIND OF VICTIMIZATION THE LAW WAS
            INTENDED TO PROHIBIT.

         Ms. M was recruited by Mr. M, a friend of her extended family, in her home country of
XXXX. Mr. M sought Ms. M’s labor as a domestic worker in the United States, where he was to
be posted as the Legal Counsellor of the Mission of XXXX to the United Nations. Mr. M met
with Ms. M’s family, gained their trust, and made important promises to Ms. M and her mother
about the terms and conditions of her employment, most of which were memorialized in a
contract signed by both parties in XXXX. Upon arrival in the United States, Ms. M quickly
learned that Mr. M had no intention of adhering to any of the agreed-upon terms of her
employment; Mr. M knowingly made those promises “with intent to defraud . . . by means of
materially false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises.” 18 U.S.C. § 1351.

         This fact pattern is all too common. See, e.g., Statement of Martina E. Vandenberg,
Attorney Jenner & Block, LLP, Legal Options to Stop Human Trafficking: Hearing Before

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 	   

4  The Federal Register commentary that addresses the U-Visa regulation, issued by the

Department of Homeland Security, supports this reading of the regulation. The commentary

explains that:

   this rule provides that criminal activity that has occurred outside of the United
   States, but that fits within a type of criminal activity listed in Section
   101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the INA, will constitute a qualifying criminal activity if it
   violates a federal statute that specifically provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction. .
   . . Congress has enacted a variety of statutes governing criminal activity occurring
   outside the territorial limits of the United States. These statutes establish
   extraterritorial and federal, criminal jurisdiction. Statutes establishing
   extraterritorial jurisdiction generally require some nexus between the criminal
   activity and U.S. interests.

72 Fed. Reg. 53014, 53020. The commentary goes on to cite several statutes as examples, which
do not explicitly articulate extraterritorial jurisdiction but have been interpreted by courts to
apply extraterritorially: “[f]or example, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2423(c), the United States has
jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute cases involving U.S. citizens or nationals who engage in
illicit sexual conduct outside the United States, such as sexually abusing a minor. See also 18
U.S.C. 32 (destruction of an aircraft); 15 U.S.C. 1 (extraterritorial application of the Sherman
Act governing antitrust laws).”

Subcomm. on Human Rights and the Law of the Senate Comm. on Judiciary, 110th Cong. 24
(2007) (describing the frequency of individuals trafficked to work as domestic workers for
diplomats); Statement of Florrie Burke, Safe Horizon, Combating Modern Slavery:
Reauthorization of Anti-Trafficking Programs: Hearing Before House Comm. on the Judiciary,
110th Cong. 83 (2007) (relating frequent instances of workers coming to the United States with
promises of work conditions and format that were never fulfilled by their traffickers). It is not
unusual for employers to exploit personal relationships with victims or their families to gain their
trust or prey on cultural or ethnic familiarity. See Vandenberg Statement, 110th Cong. 24
(providing examples when traffickers travel to small villages and convince entire families that a
job opportunity will be good for the family). This form of recruitment inherently occurs on
foreign soil. Interpreting the fraud in foreign labor contracting statute to exclude this type of
unlawful activity drastically undermines the law’s effectiveness. The statute prohibits actions
that are “quintessentially international in scope” and warrants extraterritorial application.

                                                                      APPENDIX C5
                           SWORN DECLARATION OF CLIENT NAME

I, CLIENT, declare under penalty of perjuring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, that the
following information is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge:

    1. My name is CLIENT. My date of birth is BIRTHDATE. I currently live in
             CITY, STATE.

    2. I was born and raised in CITY, Mexico, and then migrated to the United
             States to join my family—my mother and father. I had been living with my
             grandparents in Mexico, and we had a very difficult life. I wanted to join
             my parents here, and I thought that I could build a better life in the United
             States.

    3. I entered the United States without permission in DATE, crossing into
             Arizona by foot, and then travelled to STATE to join my family.

    4. I began working for EMPLOYER, in CITY, STATE on DATE. I was very
             happy at first to be working there. I worked doing TASKS.

    5. But things got much worse when I began to work for MANAGER at
             EMPLOYER. I was transferred to the DEPARTMENT of the EMPLOYER in
             YEAR. That is when MANAGER became my direct supervisor during the
             night shift.

    6. MANAGER harassed me and other immigrant employees who worked in
             my department. He would sometimes call us things like “wetback” or
             “aliens,” or “dirty,” which I did not like. He always yelled at us if we ever
             said anything back to him, as if we were defying him. It made me feel
             uncomfortable to be around him.

    7. When I started working with MANAGER, my co-workers told me to watch
             out for him. They said that he liked to touch the women in inappropriate
             places and say unpleasant things to them.

    8. For the first few weeks, I was able to avoid MANAGER. But after a few
             weeks, it was harder and harder to avoid him because many people had
             quit, and there were only a few of us left in the DEPARTMENT. At first,
             MANAGER approached me and looked at me in a sexual way, and make
             comments that made me feel uncomfortable.

    9. But after a while, he started to come up behind me while I was working
             and touch my bottom and inside my legs. The first time he did it, I
             couldn’t believe it was happening. I felt like I could not move. I was so
             scared. I tried to say something but I felt like I was frozen. He just

                                                                      APPENDIX C6
         breathed on me and laughed, and then turned and walked away like
         nothing had happened.

10. My co-worker and I talked a lot about what to do in the break room. She
         told me that there were other women who had problems with MANAGER
         in the past. She told me that she had heard that MANAGER had even
         violated another girl in the past in the storage room, but that the girl had
         just quit because she was too scared to report what had happened to the
         management. When I heard this, I felt very scared.

11. I was afraid to come to work, because I was scared that MANAGER would
         hit me, fire me, or call immigration against me. I had to support my
         family, so I kept coming to work. I tried to avoid MANAGER, but it was
         difficult. For the next few months, MANAGER kept coming up to me and
         touching me while I was working. Sometimes he would touch my legs and
         my bottom. Sometimes he would reach around and grab my breasts. Each
         time he would laugh and call me his “baby.”

12. I felt anxious and nervous about going to work. My chest felt heavy, and
         my heart felt like it was always beating too fast. I was upset and sad about
         what was happening at work and I did not want to do things I used to do.
         I got headaches, stomachaches, and threw up sometimes. I was so
         frustrated because I could not say anything about what MANAGER was
         doing to me and the other workers. I felt like I was being silenced.

13. One day, it just became too much for me. That day, MANAGER told me
         that he’d be waiting for me after work and that he was going to take me
         out for a good time. I was so scared that he was going to try to force me
         to sleep with him. I didn’t know what to do, so I texted my cousin, and
         asked her to meet me after work, and if she could bring her boyfriend
         with her. They came to meet me, so I avoided having to deal with
         MANAGER. They knew I was very scared and upset. COUSIN made me tell
         her what was happening with MANAGER. She told me that it was not my
         fault and that I could get help. I decided that I had to quit because I was
         too scared to work. I never called my work; I just stopped going. My
         cousin picked up my last paycheck for me the week after.

14. I never tried to report MANAGER to his boss or the police at the time,
         because I was scared. I was so scared he would do something against me,
         that he would hit me or do something worse. I was afraid he would call
         immigration. I had to keep silent because my job was on the line and my
         whole life was on the line because of deportation.

15. My COUSIN helped me to get in touch with COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION,
         where I met with a lawyer. The lawyer told me that what was happening
         to me was illegal, even though I was undocumented. My lawyer told me

                                                               APPENDIX C6
         that she was going to help me file a complaint with the EEOC to fix what
         was happening. I wanted to tell the EEOC everything that had happened. I
         wanted them to know my perspective and to let them know how wrong it
         was. One of my co-workers told me that there was a lawyer from the
         EEOC that I could talk to and that it would be confidential, and that
         nothing would happen to me if I talked to her, because I was still afraid of
         being deported if my MANAGER found out I had talked to them.

16. Since then, I have talked with the EEOC lawyer several times. She took my
         statement for the case. I have talked with them two or three times and
         want to help them out more if they need.

17. I still feel terrified of MANAGER. Every time I ride the bus near my old
         work, I start shaking and feel really scared. I still have nightmares that
         MANAGER is coming around the corner. It has taken me a long time to be
         able to talk to people about what is happening. I cry a lot and sometimes
         feel like I can’t do anything to make my life better.

18. I hope that I can stay in the United States to take care of my family and to
         continue to pursue this case with the EEOC. I have been living with my
         new boyfriend and baby girl. I have been attending CHURCH, and I like
         being part of this community. I hope that I can keep going to this church
         because I want to give thanks to God for my beautiful family, and that no
         one has to be treated like this again.

This statement has been read to me in my native language of Spanish. I declare
under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of my
knowledge.

NAME                                         DATE

APPENDIX C6
                                       DECLARATION OF CLIENT
                          IN SUPPORT OF U-NONIMMIGRANT STATUS

I, CLIENT, declared the following:

1. My name is CLIENT. I was born on DATE in CITY, Mexico. Please contact me through my
    attorney, ATTORNEY, at the ORGANIZATION. She can be reached at ADDRESS.

2. I am submitting this declaration in support of my application for a U nonimmigrant visa. I
    have been the victim of witness tampering and obstruction of justice at the hands of my
    former Employer, EMPLOYER. EMPLOYER is the owner of COMPANY, a janitorial
    service that cleans commercial locations. After EMPLOYER refused to pay me many
    months of wages he owed me, I filed reports of wage theft with the United States Department
    of Labor. After I sought these legal remedies EMPLOYER subjected me to threats, stalking,
    and harassment in an attempt to intimidate me and get me to abandon these legal processes.
    Because of this I have suffered severe anxiety, depression, and fear that has affected my
    entire life, as well as lost my job and many months of wages. I have been forced to seek an
    Anti-harassment Order for Protection against EMPLOYER and have made several reports to
    the police about his stalking and harassment.

3. Growing up in Mexico, my parents and I had border crossing cards that allowed us to enter
    the United States. We made about six visits a year, mostly to Nogales and Tucson. My
    mother would go shopping and I spent summer vacations with friends in Yuma, Arizona. I
    last entered the United States on DATE on a B1/B2 Tourist Visa. I have remained in the U.S.
    since that date.

4. In Mexico I worked as a technical coordinator of communications for a bank in Mexico, and
    for a company that helped United States tourists coming to Sonora. I have four children who
    still live in Mexico and who are now ages 25, 22, 18, and 16. I divorced from their mother in
    Mexico. I currently live in CITY, STATE, with my girlfriend and two of her young children
    who I help support as a parent.

5. I started working as a janitor for EMPLOYER and his COMPANY in DATE. At first I
    cleaned at BUSINESS in CITY. Later I also cleaned the offices of a nonprofit group in
    Seattle, and another company. From April until December of YEAR I worked seven days a
    week. After that I worked five or six days a week. I usually worked about 55 hours every
    week, depending on how many places I was cleaning.

6. After working for about a month, I still had not been paid by EMPLOYER. When I asked
    the manager who supervised us, MANAGER, she told me that my first month’s wages were
    going to be withheld as a deposit. At the beginning of July I still had not been paid. Finally, I
    received my first paycheck in mid-July for April and May. After that my checks were
    always delayed.

                                                                                                                    1

                                                                            APPENDIX C7
7. There was no system to track how many hours I was working, so it was really difficult to tell
    how much I was actually making per hour. Any time I would start cleaning at a new job site
    my wages for the first month of work there would be delayed a month.

8. In December of 2009, EMPLOYER’s payment for my worked started to be even further
    behind than normal. He owed me for October, November, and December. I asked
    EMPLOYER about the payment he owed me for the work I had done. He told me that he was
    having economic troubles and the Department of Labor was investigating janitorial
    companies, so he could not pay me. He also told me that if I continued insisting on being
    paid that he himself would call immigration authorities to report me.

9. After these threats I began to have anxiety and panic attacks because I was so afraid that
    EMPLOYER would report me and I would lose my job. I was anxious because I needed to
    work to be able to support my children in Mexico. I would send my children $500 to $600
    every month, which they depended on. When their school fees were due I sent more money.
    Two of my children got really sick, and because I had not been paid I was not able to send
    money for the medical care they needed. I wanted to provide for my family, but I was
    working and not getting paid. I called Mexico one night only to find out the phone had been
    disconnected for lack of payment. I started having problems focusing and constantly worried
    about making ends meet for my family. My stress prevented me from sleeping.

10. I was intimidated and scared, but I needed to continue working with the hope I would get
    paid. I felt like I had no other option to provide for my family. I was finally paid in January,
    but again the payments were behind. MANAGER also told me I needed to submit my own
    invoices from then on because I was an independent contractor, being paid as if I had a
    business of my own. I had thought I was an employee of EMPLOYER’s, but she said I was
    wrong. I learned later that they tried to tell us we were independent contractors so that they
    would not have to pay us as much. All of my jobs always took several hours longer than
    EMPLOYER told me they would take. When I asked EMPLOYER about the overtime I was
    working he told me that I was an independent contractor, not a full-time employee, so it was
    my responsibility to finish in the time I was assigned. He sharply reminded me that I was
    unauthorized to work and told me that if I didn’t want to wait to get paid I could just leave it,
    because 100 people were waiting in line ready to take my job.

11. EMPLOYER used foul language towards me at work when he ordered me to do things. I was
    struggling to maintain any concentration at work and began having regular anxiety attacks
    because I was so afraid that I would lose my job and or that EMPLOYER would report me to
    immigration authorities.

12. EMPLOYER’s payments of my wages got behind again in spring of YEAR. By July,
    EMPLOYER owned me for May, June and 15 days of July. I asked him several times about
    it, and he would just give me excuses, telling me that he couldn’t print the checks that day or
    that he had not been paid by his accounts. Finally, EMPLOYER responded by yelling at me
    “I can call immigration on you – you know that, you son of a b****!” I felt trapped and
    intimidated, afraid that EMPLOYER would do something to hurt me or turn me over to
    immigration if I tried to seek any legal help in my situation. I was scared, depressed and

                                                                                                                    2

                                                                            APPENDIX C7
    hopeless because I could not pay for my basic needs like rent, gas, or send support to my
    children because of the situation he trapped me in.

13. I finally decided I could not stand EMPLOYER’s abuse any longer. On DATE, I told
    EMPLOYER I could not work for him any longer if I did not get paid the following day. I
    tried to talk to EMPLOYER about my children’s hardship, but he refused to listen. That
    night I suffered panic and anxiety attacks and could not sleep. I was desperate – I did not
    know what to do and I worried all night. The next day when I asked about my wages I was
    told there was no check and to go home and not come back.

14. That evening MANAGER, the SMI Manager, came to my home and told me to return the
    facility keys from my worksite, because I was no longer employed by EMPLOYER. I was
    hesitant to turn over the key because it had been issued personally to me by worksite.
    MANAGER started cursing at me, yelling and threatening to call the police. At the time, I
    was renting a room in a house and I did not want to cause any problems for me or the family
    renting me the place. I was forced to give her the keys out of fear she would call the police.

15. The next day I had to return to the worksite, to gather some personal things from my locker.
    EMPLOYER was there and followed me to the basement of the building. I tried to talk to
    him about the situation, but he began to threaten me. He told me “if you try to recover this
    money you are going to know who I am. I have had this contract for five years and I have
    fired eight people like you and nothing has happened to me, so don’t act like a dumb a** and
    go to the directors because they are not going to help you. And if you talk to them then I will
    call ICE.”

16. I was so afraid that I left the building. As I was leaving, a NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION
    staff member stopped me to check in. NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION is a nonprofit that
    helps low-income people. I had built relationships with several staff members and they were
    really supportive. NON-PROFIT STAFF asked me to return later to explain what happened.
    The next day, I told the staff that EMPLOYER had not paid me and had intimidated me with
    threats. They gave me information about WORKER CENTER, where I could get help.
    After verifying that EMPLOYER had abused me and other workers, they cancelled their
    contract with EMPLOYER.

17. After Compass cancelled the contract, both EMPLOYER and MANAGER called me to
    threaten me. EMPLOYER told me over the phone “te voy a chingar”- “I’m going to screw
    you.” He said it was my fault they cancelled the account, and that I could forget about the
    money and that I was going to “find out who he was.” MANAGER called and also
    threatened me. She told me I didn’t know who EMPLOYER was yet and that he was going
    to screw me. She also said that her husband worked for the FBI and was going to “f*** you
    up.”

18. I had no more work and had not been paid thousands of dollars EMPLOYER owed me. I
    started to seek help from advocates at WORKER CENTER, where they help workers who
    have been cheated by their Employers. In November of YEAR, I decided I had to take some
    strong action and report my situation to law enforcement. With help from WORKER

                                                                                                                    3

                                                                            APPENDIX C7
    CENTER advocates, I filed a report of the wages that had not been paid to me with the U.S.
    Department of Labor. During the process, we found out that there had been other similar
    complaints made against EMPLOYER by former employees. I cooperated with all of DOL’s
    requests for information and provided them with information about my case. In January
    2011, DOL determined that EMPLOYER owed me $7,693.75. They sent EMPLOYER a
    letter informing him of this and telling him that he needed to pay me or respond.

19. Because EMPLOYER was not yet responding to communication from DOL and because I
    knew that other workers had also suffered wage theft by EMPLOYER, I decided to also work
    with advocates at WORKER CENTER on direct efforts to get EMPLOYER to pay my
    wages. We began to approach Clients of EMPLOYER’s business, to enlist their help in
    securing the wages. We talked to them, wrote them letters, and even did some peaceful
    pickets to ask these Clients to put pressure on EMPLOYER to pay the wages he owned to his
    employees. I was scared of what EMPLOYER might do, but at this point I felt I had no other
    options.

20. Through this process I become involved with the Workers Defense Committee at WORKER
    CENTER. As I heard people’s stories, I realized that a lot of people were suffering like me
    from wage theft. I began to help people in their cases and support their efforts to get paid the
    wages they were owed. I became very interested in this issue because people’s situations
    were so difficult and many had children and spouses to support.

21. When I asked the staff at WORKER CENTER about doing more to help the other workers,
    they told me about their work to change some of the wage theft laws in CITY. I volunteered
    to help. I ended up telling my story publicly to explain to people why wage theft was a big
    problem. I shared my testimony twice with the CITY Council in the efforts to pass a wage
    theft city ordinance, on DATE and DATE. I began visiting schools, churches, and radio
    shows to tell my story. I received some media coverage of these testimonies.

22. After my public testimony, EMPLOYER and others began to intimidate me in an effort to get
    me to stop seeking legal remedies and publicizing EMPLOYER’s abuse of his workers. I
    was first informed that EMPLOYER might be trying to harm me when ACQUAINTANCE,
    said he was trying to help me with my case, told me that EMPLOYER was looking for
    people to beat me up. Later, I began to be suspicious that EMPLOYER had hired
    ACQUAINTANCE to follow me and that he was just pretending to be helpful. EMPLOYER
    managed to know my whereabouts every time ACQUAINTANCE offered to help me. I
    lived about 30 minutes outside of Seattle and would have to go to the city to work on my
    case. Somehow, every time I went to Seattle EMPLOYER would call and threaten me.
    Later, ACQUAINTANCE called me and told me that EMPLOYER was serious and not a
    person to mess with, and that I should “back off or else.”

23. MANAGER also began to call me. At first she pretended that she was on my side and tried
    to gain my trust. I thought I could trust her and told her about my case against EMPLOYER
    and my efforts to recover my unpaid wages. Eventually I realized that she was just trying to
    get information for EMPLOYER. When I confronted her about this, MANAGER began to
    threaten me. She threatened to accuse me of crimes to the police or call immigration on me.

                                                                                                                    4

                                                                            APPENDIX C7
24. Around March of YEAR I also began to notice that I was being followed. A white van with
    two people inside began following and watching me. I saw this same van outside WORKER
    CENTER in Seattle. I also saw it outside my house and outside my workplace. The same
    two young people were always inside. The van followed me from the parking lot, and I saw
    them outside my second workplace that night. The van did not have a license plate in front.

25. On another occasion when I was driving on the freeway with my new Employer, a car was
    following us. It swerved in front of us and cut us off, then threw something at our car. We
    pulled off the freeway to inspect the car and someone in the other car yelled at us as we
    exited. We found that the car door was damaged. I was afraid this was EMPLOYER or
    someone he sent to follow me to try to harm me.

26. I became really afraid for my safety because of EMPLOYER and MANAGER’s threats.
    Because of the people EMPLOYER sent to stalk and harass me, I knew he was capable of
    following through with causing me serious bodily harm. My life became unbearable because
    I was scared of everything and everyone around me. I did not think I could trust anyone after
    ACQUAINTANCE and MANAGER turned out to be working for EMPLOYER. All of this
    was incredibly intimidating and I believe EMPLOYER took these actions to try to get me to
    stop the fight to recover my wages and to drop my claims with DOL.

27. I was also extremely depressed because of the economic harm EMPLOYER had caused me.
    I could not provide for my children because of the wages I had not been paid and because
    EMPLOYER had fired me for trying to be paid my wages. I became physically ill due to the
    fear and hardship of my situation – I suffered from toothaches, migraines, and loss of
    appetite and sleep because I worried about my safety.

28. The staff at WORKER CENTER encouraged me to seek a protection order because they
    shared concerns for my safety. I petitioned for an Anti-harassment Order for Protection in
    Superior Court. After a hearing where the Judge questioned EMPLOYER and me, the anti-
    harassment protection order was granted on DATE. The order required EMPLOYER to stay
    away from me, WORKER CENTER, and my home.

29. In June, I decided to pursue a private action to try to recover my wages in Superior Court,
    with hopes that this new tactic might hold EMPLOYER accountable for the wages he owed
    me. To do this you have to withdraw your specific claims with DOL, so that you can file a
    complaint with another attorney directly in the court. I filed the complaint on DATE and the
    case is still pending. I am still available to cooperate with DOL and can serve as a witness in
    their ongoing investigation of EMPLOYER. I want EMPLOYER to be held accountable and
    to keep him from being able to harm even more workers, and I will assist DOL if they need
    any further testimony from me.

30. On DATE, I and members from WORKER CENTER, and WORKER CENTER advocates,
    were doing a peaceful protest outside SITE around 7pm. This was part of our efforts to
    pressure EMPLOYER into paying the wages he owed to me and other workers.
    EMPLOYER arrived while we were there. He walked up in front of us and took my picture

                                                                                                                    5

                                                                            APPENDIX C7
    with his telephone. Before he left he got close enough to talk to me and said “I’m going to
    f**k you up” and made a threatening gesture with his hand.

31. WORKER CENTER STAFF called the police because EMPLOYER was violating the Order
    for Protection. When the police arrived I talked to them and explained that I had a protection
    order and was afraid because EMPLOYER was there in violation of the order. The police
    officers then found EMPLOYER and talked to him. They made him leave the property.
    When the judge issued the order he explained very clearly to EMPLOYER that he was not to
    come within 100 feet of my person. EMPLOYER intimidated me by getting close to me to
    take a photograph, making intimidating signs at me with his hands, and threatening me with
    his words.

32. After this incident, I wouldn’t leave my home except for work or when accompanied by a
    friend or WORKER CENTER member. I was terrified that EMPLOYER would show up
    again and do something to harm me. I could not stop worrying about EMPLOYER planning
    more ways of retaliating against me for the complaints I had made to DOL. Because of this
    incident and the many threatening phone calls I had received from MANAGER, I decided I
    needed to make a full report of all the threatening behavior to make sure there was a record.
    On DATE, I went to the Sheriff’s office to make a report. I showed them a copy of the
    protection order and explained what had happened at SITE. They asked me to write a
    declaration about the events there and the phone threats, which I did.

33. The staff at WORKER CENTER also encouraged me to move somewhere where
    EMPLOYER would not be able to find where I lived. I could not afford to move out of my
    current residence on my own, but WORKER CENTER offered me a one-time loan to help
    me find a new place for safety purposes. I moved in DATE, and then again in DATE because
    I did not feel safe anywhere.

34. Because of all these threats by EMPLOYER and others that he sent to intimidate me, I
    continue to suffer from severe anxiety and fear that he will find me and do harm to me. This
    has caused me many sleepless nights and even migraines and toothaches. I have become
    constantly afraid for my security and afraid even to walk down the street because of the
    stalking and harassment. I have had to move multiple times for fear of my safety. I lost my
    work and many months of wages owed me which added significant economic stress to my
    situation. NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION and WORKER CENTER have helped me
    economically, but I have not been able to support my children in Mexico like I used to.

35. I recently was finally able to find work as a janitor and at a door and window factory. I am
    starting to rebuild my life after all the harassment EMPLOYER put me through to deter me
    from seeking legal remedies. I currently live in CITY with my girlfriend and two of her
    children. I support her and the children as my own family. I also communicate with my own
    children in Mexico very often, over the phone or on Facebook. I still suffer from anxiety
    about my safety and fear that EMPLOYER will do something to me, and I worry about my
    family in Mexico because I cannot provide all the support they need due to the economic
    hardship EMPLOYER caused me.

                                                                                                                    6

                                                                            APPENDIX C7
36. I want to remain in the United States to continue working on my case to recover my wages.
    EMPLOYER still has not paid me the wages that the DOL found he owed me. My civil
    complaint against EMPLOYER is still pending in the courts. The case DOL has been
    investigating, on behalf of my complaint and other workers who were not paid by
    EMPLOYER is also ongoing. That case will go to trial next year, and I believe it is very
    important that I am available to assist if necessary.

37. I also want to remain in this country to receive protection from the harm EMPLOYER could
    cause me. Because of rumors I have heard, I believe EMPLOYER is part of a larger web of
    criminal activity. If I had to leave this country I am very afraid that he would send people to
    harm me in retaliation for sharing my story.

38. Another reason it is personally important for me remain in this country is to continue to
    receive the support that I need to recover from the stress, fear, and anxiety caused by
    EMPLOYER’s harassment and stalking. I have received so much support from the
    advocates at WORKER CENTER and from some of the people at the NON-PROFIT
    ORGANIZATION. This has been essential to my safety and my well being these last years.
    I also want to be able to help other workers in their difficult situations. I am a part of the
    Workers Defense Committee at WORKER CENTER and help others in their efforts to
    reclaim unpaid wages. I do not want to be forced to leave this support network, and I also
    want to be able to continue to help support others. I have started to rebuild a safe and healthy
    life after all that I have suffered, and I want a chance to stay in the United States to continue
    healing from so much fear and anxiety and gaining stability again.

RE: Substantial Abuse Determinations for U-Visa Victims of Workplace Crimes

Dear Ms. Dawkins:

         We write to you to raise concern with the Department of Homeland Security’s Bureau of
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) treatment of petitions for U Nonimmigrant
Status (U visa) in cases involving workplace-based crime. Specifically, we raise concern with its
substantial abuse determinations in cases where crimes have taken place in the workplace, and
adjudication of cases involving the qualifying criminal activities of witness tampering and
obstruction of justice.

         As federal regulations have established, law enforcement agencies that conduct their
enforcement largely in the workplace, including the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), the Department of Labor (DOL), and equivalent state and local agencies
may certify U visa petitions. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(2). In recent years, these agencies have
released U visa certification protocol, and have appointed personnel to coordinate U visa

                                                   1

                                            APPENDIX D1
certification.1 As a result, USCIS has adjudicated, and will likely adjudicate an increasing
number of U visa applications based on qualifying criminal activity in the workplace.

         Although USCIS has handled many of these workplace-based U visa petitions without
issue, USCIS has issued Requests for Evidence (RFE) or denied several U visa applications of
victims of workplace-based crime, concluding that applicants have not shown that they have
suffered “substantial physical or mental abuse” as a result of qualifying criminal activity. We
believe some of these denials reflect lack of education about the context and experience of
workplace crime victims, not failure to meet the requirements of the statute. Although USCIS
staff are familiar with determining the degree of physical and mental abuse in cases involving
domestic violence and sexual assault-related crimes, additional training on the specific dynamics
of vulnerability and abuse experienced by victims of workplace-based crime would improve
access to U visas. This issue is particularly significant for victims of obstruction of justice and
witness tampering by their employers.

         We ask that you provide further internal guidance and training to USCIS staff to ensure
that victims of workplace-based crime are adequately protected and to strengthen the ability of
labor and civil rights law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute criminal
activities. We provide some suggestions below on issues and content for such training and
request an opportunity to meet with you in the near future to further discuss these concerns. We
appreciate your commitment to making these aspects of the law work and look forward to
deepening our collaboration with you and to hearing your responses to our concerns.

         A. “Substantial Physical or Mental Abuse” for Victims of Workplace Crime

         When determining whether an applicant has suffered substantial physical or mental
abuse, USCIS considers the “nature of the injury inflicted or suffered; the severity of the
perpetrator’s conduct; the severity of the harm suffered; the duration of the infliction of the
harm; and the extent to which there is permanent or serious harm to the appearance, health, or
physical or mental soundness of the victim, including aggravation of pre-existing conditions.” 8
C.F.R. § 214.14(b)(1). USCIS has concluded that it is reasonable to consider both “the severity
of the injury suffered by the victim” and “the severity of abuse inflicted by the perpetrator.” 72
Fed. Reg. 53014, 53018 (Sept. 17, 2007). “No single factor is a prerequisite to establish that the
abuse was substantial . . . . A series of acts taken together may be considered to constitute
substantial physical or mental abuse even where no single act alone rises to that level.” 8 C.F.R.
§ 214.14(b)(1).

         Undocumented workers and guestworkers are particularly vulnerable to victimization in
the workplace. Economic dependency, power differentials between the employer and employee,
and employee isolation because of limited access to culturally and linguistically-appropriate
support systems heighten workers’ vulnerability. An abusive employer or supervisor may feel
safe in the knowledge that an undocumented worker or guestworker may not bring charges or
report abuse due to fear of retaliation, or would not call the police or other law enforcement
agencies to report crime out of fear of deportation.2 Employers may also prey upon unique
vulnerabilities such as a worker’s gender, or ethnic or cultural background.

         Many immigrant victims of workplace crime may thus be unable to leave their jobs to
escape abuse and crime at the hands of their employers, with significant psychological
consequences. Many immigrant victims of workplace crime may choose to engage in passive
coping strategies out of fear that engaging in active strategies may lead to loss of a job, exposure
to law enforcement, harm to their family members in the country of origin, or detention and
deportation. The inability to leave a job may result in prolonged and frequent exposure to abuse,
associated with more severe psychological harm.3 Moreover, victims of abuse in the workplace
who are economically dependent on abusive employers due to lack of job mobility suffer often
greater psychological harm than those who may be able to leave a job.4

                  1. Forms of Abuse in the Workplace

    In general, abuse in the workplace may take several forms, including physical, sexual,
psychological, immigration, and economic abuse. In the case of minors, USCIS adjudicators
should also consider negligence as a form of psychological abuse. The injury suffered by victims
of such abuse may manifest as physical or mental injury. Such forms of employer abuse may
manifest itself in the following ways. We also attach a table with concrete examples of such
abuse in the workplace as Exhibit A.

     Physical abuse: Physical abuse includes the intentional use of physical force with the
         potential for causing death, disability, injury, or harm. It may include, but is not limited to
         physical assault and attempted assault.5 In the workplace, physical abuse is unique due to
         the power differential between the perpetrator (employer) and victim (worker), and the
         perpetrator’s use of physical abuse to further establish power over the victim. Physical
         abuse may range from behaviors such as shoving or hitting a worker to full-scale attacks.
         In most cases, a perpetrator may feel safe in the knowledge that an undocumented worker
         or guestworker will not bring charges or report the abuse to superiors for fear of
         retaliation or other repercussions. Physical abuse may also include the employer’s
         maintenance of a dangerous workplace environment that leads to injury or potential

                                                                            APPENDIX D1
         harm, or preventing workers from attending to basic bodily needs, such as using the
         bathroom or taking care of medical needs. It may also include assigning dangerous jobs
         or arduous jobs as punishment, as well as forcing an employee to stay after his or her
         shift for longer hours than agreed or required, leading to physical exhaustion and other
         injuries.

     Sexual abuse: The continuum of activities that constitute sexual abuse include acts
         ranging from unwelcome propositions or comments, disguised fondling, and unwelcome
         touching, to rape in the workplace by a supervisor, co-workers, or customers. In some
         situations, an employer may send a message that working conditions will not improve or
         that wages will be withheld unless an employee submits to a sexual encounter or
         unwelcome touching. Other examples of activities include spreading rumors or making
         offensive comments about a worker’s sexual life or sexual orientation, or making insults
         of a sexual nature. Sexual abuse also includes an employer’s failure to discipline or
         enforce rules against sexual harassment or assault by supervisors, co-workers or clients,
         as well as the creation of an unsafe environment where employees are hyper-vigilant and
         on the defense against sexual assault at any time.

     Psychological abuse: Psychological abuse in the workplace can include verbal abuse,
         emotional abuse, intimidation, and manipulation that diminish a worker’s self-worth and
         independence. Verbal abuse includes yelling, screaming, name-calling, insulting, using
         racial or other derogatory epithets, and belittling by an employer. Emotional abuse may
         include unwarranted blaming, shaming, isolation, threats, demands of obedience to
         whims, anger when tasks are not completed perfectly, and indifference to a worker’s
         pressing needs. Intimidation may include intense surveillance, making fun of a worker,
         making a worker perform humiliating or demeaning tasks, monitoring a worker’s
         personal time, or making threats. Manipulation may include statements or actions
         designed to turn other people against a worker, using others to pressure a worker into an
         action, shifting from a nurturing to a punishing stance without provocation, threatening a
         worker with punishment, and forcing participation in a criminal activity. Employers can
         psychologically terrorize immigrant employees by utilizing strategies of abuse by using
         issues that are culturally meaningful to the employee.

     Immigration abuse: Immigration abuse occurs when an abuser of an undocumented
         immigrant victim threatens deportation and/or actively uses their power over a victim’s
         immigration status to exploit the victim’s fear of deportation. The aim of this abusive
         strategy is to prevent a worker from seeking help or contacting law enforcement.6 In the
         workplace, immigration abuse takes place when a worker’s immigration status is used to
         exploit, keep a worker trapped in harmful working conditions, or prevent a worker from
         cooperating with law enforcement officials. It also includes instances where the employer

         or supervisor tells workers that they have paid ICE to refrain from enforcing immigration
         laws in their workplace.

     Economic abuse. Economic need is one of the most important barriers that impede
         immigrant workers from leaving an abusive workplace. Lack of money to support the
         worker and the worker’s family, often in the home country, is a significant factor for
         undocumented workers or guestworkers who have come to the United States in search of
         better conditions. Workers may fear not being able to find other employment due to their
         lack of authorization, particularly those who live paycheck to paycheck. Employers may
         also fail to pay the correct amount of money for hours worked, withhold leave, provide
         economic punishment for minor infractions, or charge workers for items that should be
         provided by the employer, such as uniforms and safety equipment. Employers may also
         threaten workers that they will not renew contracts, mislead workers about their rights as
         employees, and withhold information about relevant procedures and protections.

                  2. Effects of Abuse on Victims of Crime in the Workplace

         A large body of research has established that workplace abuse produces a wide range of
physical and psychological problems in victims.7 Abuse and exploitation at work not only
affects direct victims, but also impacts co-workers who witness the abuse of their peers and thus
fear for themselves. These effects may include psychological harm, physical harm, and social
harm.

     Psychological harm. Victims of workplace abuse often report experiencing higher levels
         of general stress and anxiety. Victims may exhibit symptoms including insomnia,
         constant worry, daily sadness, irritability, extreme fatigue, lack of interest in things that
         interested them in the past, lack of motivation, poor appetite, crying spells, nightmares,
         feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, and somatic symptoms such as migraines and
         digestive problems.8

         Abuse in the workplace may also be associated with acute clinical mental health
         symptoms and diagnosable disorders. Mental health problems such as depression,
         anxiety, mood disorders, dissociation, substance abuse, suicide attempts, acting out, and
         post traumatic symptoms are often found in victims of abuse and maltreatment.9 Workers
         may develop symptoms compatible with the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder,
         somatization, and depression. 10 Working in stressful conditions may produce chronic

         trauma—which consists of single stressful events that accumulate over time and combine
         with a toxic environment—multiplies the maladaptive effects of a traumatic event. Where
         specific traumatic experiences are added to the cumulative effect of repeated
         psychological abuse and deprivation, significant personality changes may occur. When a
         person’s identity is organized around internal distress, fear, and a sense of fragility,
         personal and emotional growth are likely to be stunted.

     Physical harm. Workplace abuse is associated with negative physical health
         consequences. In addition to the direct physical injuries caused by the abuse itself or
         dangerous working conditions, victims of workplace abuse report a wide range of
         secondary somatic symptoms, including, but not limited to headaches and sleep
         disturbances, heart-related health issues, sexually-transmitted diseases and unhealthy
         weight loss or gain. Victims of abuse may also engage in unhealthy behaviors as a coping
         mechanism to deal with high levels of psychological stress.11

     Social harm. The experience of abuse in the workplace can adversely impact victims’
         interpersonal relationships. Victims of workplace abuse may deplete their cognitive and
         physical resources coping with the stress of the abuse, leaving little resources available
         for use when interacting outside the workplace environment. This may lead to a
         decreased quality of social relationships and conflict in their intimate relationships. A
         survey of employees has reported that workplace abuse is associated with high levels of
         family conflict.12

    Because USCIS is likely to encounter greater numbers of U visa applications from victims of
crime in the workplace, we recommend that the agency provide additional training to U visa
adjudicators on the specific forms and effects of abuse in the workplace. As advocates and
clinicians with experience in this field, we would be happy to support additional training in any
way.

         B. Substantial Abuse Determinations for the Qualifying Criminal Activities of
Obstruction of Justice, Witness Tampering, and Perjury

         In many cases, victims of workplace crime may receive certification by law enforcement
agencies for the qualifying criminal activity of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and
perjury. Under U visa standards, a person is considered a victim of witness tampering,
obstruction of justice, or perjury, including any attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit
one or more of those offenses, if: (A) The petitioner has been directly and proximately harmed
by the perpetrator of the witness tampering, obstruction of justice, or perjury; and (B) there are
reasonable grounds to conclude that the perpetrator committed the witness tampering,
obstruction of justice, or perjury offense, at least in principal part, as a means (1) to avoid or

frustrate efforts to investigate, arrest, prosecute, or otherwise bring to justice the perpetrator for
other criminal activity; or (2) to further the perpetrator's abuse or exploitation of or undue control
over the petitioner through manipulation of the legal system. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(14)(ii).

         Employers who seek to obstruct justice or prevent witnesses from participating in official
proceedings or investigations often use abusive methods and/or build upon prior patterns of
abuse in order to achieve their ends. Victims of such crimes have typically suffered abuse at the
hands of their employers, whose obstructive activity, witness tampering, and perjury to avoid
detection and prosecution are symptomatic of a larger pattern of harm and exploitation. Indeed,
employers’ actions to obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses, and commit perjury may often
manifest as substantial abuse for employees who have endured multiple violations in the
workplace.

         Based on experience with these cases, we believe that USCIS adjudicators would benefit
from additional training on this issue. USCIS has issued Requests for Evidence (RFE) or denied
several U visa applications of victims of obstruction of justice and witness tampering in the
workplace, concluding that applicants have not shown that they have suffered “substantial
physical or mental abuse.” We believe that many of these determinations are based on a
misunderstanding of the unique nature of abuse in the workplace. We attach one such example to
this letter as Exhibit B.

         Typical cases involving obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and perjury in the
workplace may involve employers’ attempts to avoid detection and investigation for violations of
workplace standards, including wage and hour violations, false record-keeping, underage labor,
and health and safety violations. Often, employers may issue threats, retaliate against workers
who may ask for unpaid wages or assert their workplace rights, or engage in physical, economic,
and verbal abuse to further their control over workers. For example, employers who are under
threat of investigation may engage in the following activities:

     Direct or indirect threats of firing, physical harm to the employee or family members, or
         of potential reports of worker or worker’s friends/family to immigration enforcement or
         local law enforcement if workers do not withdraw claims, cooperate/collaborate with
         employer, or lie to investigators;

     Confiscation of workers’ personal identification documents, passports, or work permits,
         limiting mobility of the worker or ability to leave;

     Retaliation, harassment, stalking, intimidation, isolation, demotion, transfer to inferior
         position, insulting remarks, derogatory comments, and denial of privileges, wages,
         payment, or further work;

     Denial of access to food, water, housing, or basic needs if workers do not withdraw
         claims, cooperate/collaborate with employer, or lie to investigators.13

13 Significantly, these activities mirror the dynamics of power and control inherent in a situation of domestic
violence involving an immigrant victim. See, e.g. Nat’l Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence, Immigrant Power
and Control Wheel, available at:
http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Immigrant%20P&C%20wheel%20NO%20SHADING%20-%20NCDSV-
ICE_updated2009.pdf (last accessed Mar. 21, 2013).

                                                               7

                                                                            APPENDIX D1
    Victims of these crimes in workplace settings often suffer serious consequences as a result of
the employer’s criminal activity. In many cases, victims of witness tampering, obstruction of
justice, or perjury are particularly vulnerable to aggravation of underlying chronic stress or
trauma caused by long-term abuse. For example, workers who are chronically abused may learn
to submit and comply with abusive conditions in order to survive. An employer’s interference in
a worker’s attempt to break the cycle of abuse by cooperating with law enforcement officials
may thus provoke heightened fear and even more severe psychological harm as described above.

    As awareness of the U visa on the part of victims and agencies that enforce laws protecting
immigrant workers increases, we predict that USCIS will encounter more U visa applications
from victims of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and perjury in the workplace. We
suggest that now is the time for USCIS to provide additional trainings to U visa adjudicators on
the particular abuse suffered by victims of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and perjury
by their employers. We would like the opportunity to discuss with you the experts and materials
that USCIS could use to train its staff.

    USCIS’s commitment to protecting victims of crime provides key protections for the most
vulnerable in our society, as well as our communities as a whole. We appreciate your efforts, and
hope that this letter provides an opportunity for further discussion of the particular challenges
faced by victims of workplace-based crime. We look forward to continued collaboration and to
your response. Please contact Eunice Cho at echo@nelp.org or at 510-663-5707 with any
questions.

                                            APPENDIX D2
Dear Mr. Mayorkas and Ms. Scialabba:

         On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to raise concerns with U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) treatment of U visa applications in cases
involving qualifying crimes in the workplace. Specifically, we raise concern with USCIS’s
understanding and application of the “substantial physical or mental abuse” standard in cases
involving U visa crimes in the workplace.1 The crimes suffered by U visa applicants in these
cases include several of the qualifying categories of crimes in the U visa statute, most notably
witness tampering, obstruction of justice, perjury, and extortion, usually taking place in the
workplace setting, often where employer offenders attempt to thwart investigations into their
unlawful practices.

    The National Employment Law Project (NELP) and ASISTA have served as a national
clearinghouse for advocates filing U visas for victims of crime in the workplace.2 Based on
reports from advocates nationwide and our work with USCIS to address these cases, it appears
the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) and Vermont Service Center (VSC) have wrongly
denied a substantial number of workplace-based U visa petitions. In doing so, AAO and VSC
have employed varying interpretations of “substantial abuse” contrary to USCIS practice in cases
based on other crimes. These varying interpretations appear to have created a higher set of
standards for evaluating abuse in cases arising in the workplace. Nothing in the statute justifies
such a higher standard. Attached is a more lengthy discussion of the issues arising in such cases,
with legal analysis of why these denials violate the law, reflect a need for training on workplace-
based abuse, or both.

         Recent Requests for Evidence (RFE), Notices of Intent to Deny (NOID), and denials
have resulted in lengthy delays for relief for victims of crime in vulnerable situations, and have
taxed the scarce resources of non-profit organizations working on behalf of low-wage immigrant
communities. This development is especially troubling at a time when other federal agencies
most likely to detect crime in the workplace have recently implemented comprehensive U visa
certification policies. These agencies include the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB),
and equivalent state and local agencies.

         To address this issue, we request that the AAO halt any denials in such cases until USCIS
implements corrective measures. Corrective measures should feature new training for VSC and
AAO officers on the nature and context of workplace-based crimes (as was done in the past for
domestic violence and sexual assault). We also request a meeting with you and relevant USCIS
officers who develop and implement policies concerning U visas on this matter, and suggest
USCIS’s active consultation with the EEOC, DOL, NLRB, and equivalent state and local
agencies with U visa certification programs.

1 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b)(1).
2 For your reference, we also attach a copy of a letter addressed to USCIS last year on March 28, 2013, regarding
Substantial Abuse Determinations for U Visa Victims of Workplace Crimes, which provides concrete examples of
substantial abuse and harm experienced by victims of workplace crime.

Workplace-Based U Visa Petitions:
Summary of Problematic Denials, NOIDs, and RFEs by USCIS

USCIS’s treatment of U visa petitions arising from workplace-based crime reveals the following
areas of concern:

    1) USCIS has applied an inconsistent and higher standard for a showing of
         “substantial physical or mental abuse” for victims of workplace crime than for victims
         of more commonly filed U visa crimes, including domestic violence. In these cases,
         adjudicators have (1) denied cases on the basis that harm suffered by the victim was not
         permanent; and (2) concluded that symptoms of harm that ordinarily lead to a finding of
         substantial abuse in domestic violence cases were not sufficient in cases involving
         workplace crime.

    2) USCIS needs more training and education on the context of workplace-based
         crimes. USCIS adjudications indicate confusion and misunderstanding of the context
         and elements of qualifying criminal activities commonly found in the workplace setting.
         In particular, USCIS adjudicators (1) seem confused about the ways broader labor
         violations contribute to qualifying abuse suffered by victims of workplace-based crime;
         (2) disregard or inadequately consider aggravation of prior injury to applicants; and (3)
         impose unreasonable and inconsistent standards of proof to show a nexus between the
         qualifying criminal activity and the abuse suffered by victims.

    3) USCIS issues generic and template RFEs failing to articulate evidence of substantial
         abuse supplied in the original petition and why evidence supplied is insufficient. We
         realize USCIS is aware of the general problem of template RFEs; we wish to highlight,
         however, how it is impeding proper consideration of workplace-based cases.

We include illustrative examples of these issues below; a summary of relevant cases are included
in the attached Appendix. Please contact Eunice Cho at echo@nelp.org for a copy of full
documents, which we have omitted for ease of electronic transmission due to the number of
recipients.

    I. USCIS Applies a Higher And Inconsistent Standard for Showing “Substantial
             Abuse” in Workplace-Based U Visa Petitions

    As noted above, USCIS has issued troubling denials, NOIDs, and RFEs in cases involving
workplace crime, reflecting inconsistent and higher standards for a showing of “substantial
abuse” for victims of workplace crime than for victims of more common U visa crimes,
including domestic violence. We address examples of the problematic analysis below.

         A. USCIS Requires Permanent Harm

         USCIS has issued several denials concluding that applicants have not suffered substantial
abuse because the harm suffered was not permanent, particularly where the victim had shown
some measures of improvement and recovery.

USCIS Substantial Abuse Interpretations

                                           APPENDIX D2
    For example, in a recent denial, the AAO stated:

    “[The psychologist’s] evaluation and the other evidence in the record fails to demonstrate any
    permanent or serious harm to the petitioner’s overall health, appearance or mental soundness as a
    result of the criminal activity perpetrated against her.”3

    This victim of witness tampering was diagnosed with dysthymic disorder and post-traumatic
stress. The psychological evaluation found that “[a]lthough [the petitioner] has been partially
successful by pushing through pain and stress to continue functioning, she is at risk of coping
poorly with any added stresses and become more even more distraught . . . the experience at
[employer] made [petitioner] more vulnerable psychologically for future challenges.”4 In its
denial, however, the AAO repeatedly noted evidence of the petitioner’s improved functioning to
conclude that the harm was insufficient.

    In another denial, the AAO noted that:

    while [the social worker] and the petitioner described her feeling anxious, fearful and powerless . . . .,
    the petitioner also indicated that her life has improved since she cooperated with the DOL
    investigation. The record does not demonstrate that, as a victim of witness tampering, the petitioner
    has endured any permanent or serious harm to her appearance, health, or physical or mental
    soundness.5

    In a third denial, the AAO noted that “the petitioner also states that things are better in her
life now that she is no longer working for her former employer.”6 These statements imply that
USCIS considers resiliency a negative factor.

    Nothing in the statute or regulations governing U visas requires that harm be permanent to
constitute substantial abuse; permanent harm is only one of many factors that USCIS may
consider in making a determination.7 Even a casual observer would realize that were USCIS to
apply this standard to survivors of domestic violence, few would qualify for the U visa.8 Indeed,
USCIS’s insistence that harm suffered by victims of crime be permanent contradicts the goals of
the U visa program itself: one reason the U visa is helpful to noncitizen victims of crimes is that

or mental soundness of the victim” as one of several factors in determining substantial abuse. 8 C.F.R. §
214.14(b)(1).

it offers a path to surviving and thriving, not remaining a perpetual “victim.”9 We doubt
Congress would agree with denying status to “survivors” because they no longer consider
themselves purely as “victims” and are able to overcome the harm they’ve suffered from a
qualifying crime.

         B. USCIS Requires Greater “Harm” for Workplace-Based U Visa Petitions Than
             for Cases Involving Sexual Assault or Domestic Violence

    The VSC has issued denials articulating facts as inadequate that, if applied to domestic
violence cases, would result in finding sufficient harm. VSC frequently states in RFEs for
workplace-based U visas that “nervousness, anxiety and distress” and “fear, stress and anxiety”
are not substantial physical or mental abuse.10 For example, in one recent revocation of an
approved workplace-based U visa, VSC found that “nervousness, headaches, and sleeplessness
are not substantial physical or mental abuse.”11 In another case, VSC found that headaches and
feelings of fear and nervousness, which led a forensic social worker and a psychologist to
diagnose the petitioner with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, were not sufficient to demonstrate
substantial abuse.12

    Were USCIS to apply this approach to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, they
would deny most U visas based on those crimes. Nervousness, fear, distress, sleeplessness,
stress, and anxiety have been and should continue to be sufficient harm for a showing of
substantial abuse for U visa applications based on sexual assault or domestic violence. They are
textbook examples of the harm commonly suffered by such survivors.13 Moreover, USCIS’s
summary conclusion that these symptoms do not constitute substantial mental abuse is
inconsistent with widely understood clinical diagnoses linking these symptoms to psychological

disorders that impair a victim’s soundness and functioning, including depression, somatization,
and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.14

    In the domestic violence context, USCIS has received training on how mental and emotional
harm reveals the profound impact of sexual assault and domestic abuse on those who experience
them. Many survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, for instance, say that overcoming
psychological harm is much harder than recovering from abrasions and broken bones. We
suggest that there is no rationale for finding such harm insufficient for other kinds of crimes.
USCIS should apply a consistent analysis of harm to victims of workplace-based crime,
including witness tampering, obstruction of justice, perjury, and extortion.15

    II. USCIS Needs Additional Training and Education on the Context of Workplace-
             Based Crimes

    USCIS’s adjudication of U visa petitions indicates a need for training and education on the
context of workplace-related crimes. One reason USCIS applies a more helpful standard for
domestic violence cases is the regular and extensive training adjudicators receive on domestic
violence and its context.

    As domestic violence and sexual assault training has shown in the past, an understanding of
the context of the crime for the individual is essential to understanding the harm an individual
suffers, which is framed as “substantial abuse” for U visa applicants. For instance, adjudicators
are trained to understand that abuse may be both objective and subjective, and that the facts of an
individual case, seen in a broader context, often elucidate the subjective harm experienced by a
victim.16 Many examples of abusive behavior in domestic violence cases are not qualifying
crimes (i.e., humiliation and economic control), but the harm these forms of abuse may cause is
directly related to qualifying criminal acts by abusers (such as assault). Perpetrators may, for
example, use gestures that to others would be meaningless but to their victims means “I will hit
you, kill you, or harm our child if you don’t comply.” Similarly, the threats that employers use
against employees who fight back against their unlawful labor practices are particularly effective
and harmful because they are rooted in the context of exploitation and abuse that workers have
suffered at the worksite.

    We respectfully suggest that the AAO and VSC halt any denials of workplace-based cases
until USCIS has conducted training on the context of such crimes.

USCIS Substantial Abuse Interpretations

                                           APPENDIX D2
         A. USCIS Adjudicators Need Training on the Relationship between Labor
             Violations and Substantial Abuse in Workplace Obstruction of Justice, Witness
             Tampering and Perjury Cases

         U visa regulations acknowledge, to some degree, that the underlying context of abuse is
relevant in cases involving obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and perjury. They require
petitioners who are victims of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and perjury to establish
that the perpetrator committed the offense to avoid efforts to bring the perpetrator to justice, or to
further the perpetrator’s abuse or exploitation or undue control over the petitioner through
manipulation of the legal system.17 This language explicitly acknowledges, and ties eligibility to,
the context of employer exploitation and control.

    Underlying labor violations warranting intervention from federal and state labor and
employment agencies, such as wage and hour violations, might not, in themselves, constitute
qualifying criminal activity. Such violations do, however, inform the broader context of abuse,
intimidation, and control in which the qualifying crimes by employers take place. Employers
may seek to derail investigations of their misconduct through witness tampering, obstruction of
justice, and perjury. As in domestic violence cases, the resulting harm suffered by victims of
these crimes is grounded in the broader context of the employment relationship. USCIS,
however, seems confused by the context of these cases, often assuming that the existence of
underlying labor violations nullifies the qualifying crime and the harm it causes. For example, in
one denial of a witness tampering case, VSC stated that

    It appears that you were a victim of New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) pay violation .
    . . in addition to other violations. However, these are not considered qualifying criminal activities as
    defined above, nor have you demonstrated that the similarities are substantial. The evidence provided
    with your filing does not include sufficient information to conclude that N.Y. Labor law violations
    and witness tampering are similar.18

The applicant did not argue that labor law violations are similar to witness tampering; she merely
showed that the witness tampering took place because she was challenging underlying labor
violations. Without the underlying labor violations, the perpetrator/employer would not need to
engage in witness tampering. If USCIS will only consider witness tampering as a qualifying
crime when there are no underlying labor law violations, then it is eliminating most workplace-
based crimes as qualifying U crimes. There is no basis in the statute or regulations for this result.

         Under the regulations, adjudicators must account for the aggravation of a victim’s pre-
existing conditions when making a substantial abuse determination.19 Adjudicators also should
consider a series of acts (a form of “totality of circumstances” test) as demonstrating substantial
abuse by the perpetrator, even if no single act alone rises to that level.20 The regulations
accurately reflect well-established concepts of trauma.21 USCIS adjudicators, however, have
dismissed or ignored credible evidence of pre-existing conditions suffered by victims of crime in
the workplace and often seem more inclined to deny than grant when presented with a pattern of
harm.

       In particular, the AAO seems unaware of “aggravation of prior injury” prong of the
regulations. In one denial, the AAO noted:

        “[The psychologist’s] evaluation primarily focuses on childhood experiences and events
        at the petitioner’s former place of employment unrelated to the qualifying criminal
        activity, witness tampering.22

In another case, the AAO concluded that

         “[The psychologist’s] evaluation, which discusses many events in the petitioner’s life, does not
         sufficiently demonstrate that the petitioner’s dysthymic disorder is directly related to the witness
         tampering.”23

    These statements reveal inadequate training on (1) USCIS’s own regulations, as well as (2)
the interpretation of those regulations in the context of the complex trauma that takes place in
workplace-base crimes and (3) how employer threats may trigger trauma symptoms within an
abusive workplace context. Prior trauma, pre-existing conditions and the history of workplace
trauma all are relevant to the harm triggered by witness tampering, obstruction of justice,
perjury, and other qualifying crimes in the workplace.

    C. USCIS Adjudicators Need Training on Satisfactory Proof of Nexus between the
    Qualifying Criminal Activity and the Abuse Suffered by Victims of Workplace-Based
    Crime

         Petitioners must establish that the harm suffered by the victim is the result of the
qualifying criminal activity.24 USCIS adjudicators, however, have erroneously denied petitions

19 “Whether abuse is substantial is based on a number of factors, including but not limited to: . . . the extent to which
there is permanent or serious harm to the appearance, health, or physical or mental soundness of the victim,
including aggravation of pre-existing conditions.” 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b)(1).
20 “A series of acts taken together may be considered to constitute substantial physical or mental abuse even where
no single act alone rises to that level.” 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b)(1).

and frequently issue RFEs where petitioners have submitted clear and conclusive evidence of a
nexus between the qualifying crime and the harm suffered by the applicant.25

         USCIS adjudicators summarily dismiss credible and reasonable evidence, including
declarations and evaluations by psychologists or licensed social workers establishing that the
harm suffered by victims was caused by the employer’s criminal activity. For example,
adjudicators have found a nexus lacking between the crime and the harm suffered by the victim
because the petitioner experienced exploitation or mistreatment beyond that which was identified
as the qualifying criminal activity by the certifying agency. For example, the AAO offered the
following analysis in its denial:

         [The psychologist] diagnoses the petitioner with dysthymic disorder, stating that the petitioner’s
         mental health conditions are related not only to the certified crime, but also to other activities that
         occurred at the petitioner’s former place of employment, such as sexual harassment, sexual
         exploitation, extortion, and dangerous working conditions. The harm that USCIS assesses under
         the standards and factors of 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(b)(1) derives from the certified criminal activity.26

    The abuse, exploitation and control mentioned here are relevant to the aggravated injury
caused by later threats and retaliation when workers attempt to hold the employer accountable
for violating the law. As with sexual assault and domestic violence cases, such prior harm need
not flow from the qualifying crime. Under the AAO’s analysis, however, harm derived from
more than one cause is not considered qualifying harm at all. This “single cause” nexus is
required neither in the statute nor the regulations and, if applied to many domestic violence and
sexual assault cases, would result in denials.

    III. USCIS Adjudicators Need Training on Crafting RFEs that Articulate the Evidence
             of Substantial Abuse Supplied by Petitioner, and Why Such Evidence Is
             Insufficient

    As in other types of U visa petitions, USCIS routinely issues RFEs requesting additional
documentary evidence of substantial abuse in cases involving crime in the workplace. This is
true even where petitioners have submitted significant amounts of credible evidence, including
declarations, news articles, and supplemental letters from witnesses discussing the abuse and

24 In order to qualify for a U visa, an individual “must have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result
of having been a victim of qualifying criminal activity.” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(U)(i)(I). As the DHS has explained,
“federal statutory provisions consistently define ‘victim’ as one who has suffered direct harm or who is directly and
proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a crime.” 72 Fed. Reg. 53,014, 53,016 (citations omitted).
25 See, e.g. Case 7, Zulma Bonilla Gomez. Ms. Bonilla was a victim of extortion, conspiracy of trafficking, and

attempted involuntary servitude. Her petition included a diagnosis of depression and PTSD by a psychologist and a

licensed social worker, diagnosis for Bell’s Palsy with a supporting physician letter, personal declaration, supporting
declarations, and medical records. VSC denied the petition for lack of substantial abuse. In its denial, VSC noted

only that “[t]he medical notes do not appear to reference any physical or mental abuse you suffered as a result of the
incident . . . you do not provide evidence of a linkage between the incident and the information provided on Bell’s
Palsy.” USCIS Vermont Service Center, Denial of Petition, Zulma Areli Gomez Bonilla, A 206-613-039, *3, Feb.

harm suffered by the victim in the original petition.27 In addition, some adjudicators seem to
have difficulty identifying the elements of force, the threat of force, or the threat of legal
coercion in cases involving involuntary servitude and trafficking, even where the petitioner has
provided clear evidence of these elements.28 In one case, the petitioner submitted a detailed
affidavit and Form I-918B describing abusive and coercive working conditions:

    On a daily basis I was called insulting names and threatened by the owners and their supervisors . . . .
    It made me feel like I was worthless. I was always afraid of being deported . . . I cut my foot with a
    knife while working. I went upstairs to one of the owners to let him know I hurt my foot. He
    answered he didn’t care and if I couldn’t move my foot enough to work he would just take care of me
    and put me in the dumpster. I wasn’t sure if he was threatening to fire me and throw me in the trash or
    if he was threatening to kill me and put my body in the dumpster . . . .29

VSC, however, issued an RFE stating that

    There is no evidence contained in the record to suggest that [employer] forced you to work for them.
    It also cannot be concluded that you were forced to remain working for [employer] against your will,
    that you were threatened or abused while at work, or that you were forced to engage in misleading
    conduct.30

The same RFE instructed the petitioner to “[s]ubmit a signed statement in your own words
describing the facts of your victimization . . . . Please provide evidence to demonstrate that you
are the victim of substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of qualifying criminal
activity.”31

28 18 U.S.C. § 1584 prohibits holding a person in involuntary servitude, which occurs when an employer knowingly
compels a worker’s labor for a period of time against a worker’s will by the use of force, the threat of force, or the
threat of legal coercion. 18 U.S.C. § 1589 also prohibits forced labor by means of psychological and nonviolent
coercion. 22 U.S.C. § 7102(9)(B) defines “severe forms of trafficking in persons” as “the recruitment, harboring,
transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion
for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.” State anti-trafficking and
involuntary statutes may include broader definitions. Polaris Project, 2013 State Ratings on Human Trafficking
Laws (2013), available at http://www.polarisproject.org/storage/documents/POC/2013-State-Ratings_pamphlet-
3pgr.pdf. See also Kathleen Kim, The Coercion of Trafficked Workers, 96 Iowa L. Rev. 409 (2011) (describing
elements of coercion in cases involving involuntary servitude, trafficking, and forced labor).

the petitioner’s abusive work environment, stating “[petitioner] suffered substantial mental and emotional harm as a
result of the coercive work environment perpetrated by [employer]. He worked in a state of persistent fear due to the
managers’ intimidating abuse and threat of deportation.” In re Mario Alberto Ardon Flores, A 200-069-491, Index to

DOL).

    In another example, VSC issued a summary RFE requesting additional evidence of
substantial abuse for a victim of involuntary servitude, obstruction of justice, and witness
tampering at the hands of his employer. The petitioner had provided a declaration describing the
slave-like conditions of his labor and the physical and psychological injuries suffered as a result;
medical records; and several newspaper articles describing the abuses and poor living conditions
endured by laborers. VSC, however, requested that the petitioner “provide evidence to
demonstrate that you are the victim of substantial physical or mental abuse [sic] as a result of
qualifying criminal activity.”32

    VSC has issued generic and template RFEs that fail to articulate evidence of substantial
abuse supplied by the petitioner, even where petitioners have included declarations and
supporting documents that speak directly to the non-financial mental or physical harm suffered
by victims. Instead, a number of RFEs for workplace-related U visa cases include only a blanket
statement that labor violations involving lost wages do not constitute substantial abuse. Again, a
recent RFE stated: “regulation does not expressly reference crimes involving financial losses,
therefore, loss [sic] wages would not establish that you were victim [sic] of substantial physical
or mental abuse.”33 Several other RFEs have noted that “[r]egulation does not expressly
reference crimes involving financial loss. Therefore, such crimes are not included as qualifying
criminal activity for U nonimmigrant status.”34 The applications did not solely rely on financial
harm to meet the substantial harm requirement, yet the adjudicators seem to seize on the mention
of financial harm to dismiss entirely the evidence supplied.

    These RFEs suggest that VSC adjudicators need additional training, oversight and review of
decisions on workplace-specific crimes.

IV. Conclusion

    For these reasons, we request that the AAO and VSC halt any denials in U visa applications
based on workplace-based crimes until USCIS implements new training for both VSC and AAO
officers on the nature and context of workplace-based crimes (as was done in the past for
domestic violence and sexual assault). We would be happy to provide the agency with
suggestions for trainers and background information on this subject.

    We appreciate USCIS’s commitment to protecting victims of crime, and raise these issues in
the spirit of collaboration and cooperation. We hope to meet with those of you involved in
implementing this aspect of the law, either by phone or in person. For more information on any
of the RFEs, NOIDs, and denials attached, or if you have any questions, please contact Eunice
Cho at echo@nelp.org, or Gail Pendleton at gail@asistahelp.org at any time.
