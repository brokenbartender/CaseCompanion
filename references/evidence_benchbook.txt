Note on Precedential Value
The Michigan Judicial Institute endeavors to present accurate, binding preceden t
when discussing substantive legal issues. “The essence of the common law
doctrine of precedent or stare decisis is that the rule of the case creates a binding
legal precept.” Hudson v Dep’t of Corrections, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Maintaining consistency in the law i s
one of the primary benefits of stare decisis, as it provides the public with some
level of predictability in how the courts have interpreted the law.” Plachta v
Plachta, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2026). Generally, trial courts “must follow the
published decisions of the Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court.”
People v Metamora Water Serv, Inc, 276 Mich App 376, 382 (2007).
Negative subsequent history. Several cases in this book have been reversed,
vacated or overruled in part and/or to the extent that they contained a specifi c
holding on one issue or another. While a case that has been fully reversed,
vacated, or overruled is no longer binding precedent, it is less clear when a n
opinion is not reversed, vacated or overruled in its entirety. Some cases state tha t
“an overruled proposition in a case is no reason to ignore all other holdings in the
case.” People v Carson, 220 Mich App 662, 672 (1996). See also Stein v Home-Owner s
Ins Co, 303 Mich App 382, 389 (2013) (distinguishing between reversals in thei r
entirety and reversals in part); Graham v Foster, 500 Mich 23, 31 n 4 (2017) (becaus e
the Supreme Court vacated a portion of the Court of Appeals decision, “tha t
portion of the Court of Appeals’ opinion [had] no precedential effect and the trial
court [was] not bound by its reasoning”). However, other cases provide that a
“decision that has been reversed on other grounds has no precedential value.”
Dunn v Detroit Inter-Ins Exch, 254 Mich App 256, 262 (2002), citing Taylor v
Kurapati, 236 Mich App 315 (1999). See also Horace v City of Pontiac, 456 Mich 744,
754–755 (1998) (holding that where the Supreme Court reverses a Court of
Appeals decision on one issue and does not specifically address a second issue i n
the case, “no rule of law remain[s] from the Court of Appeals decision”). Note
that Stein specifically distinguished its holding from the Dunn holding because
the precedent discussed in Dunn involved a reversal in its entirety while the
precedent discussed in Stein involved a reversal in part. Stein, 303 Mich App a t
389.
Because it may be unclear under certain circumstances how subsequent case
history may affect the precedential value of a particular opinion, trial court s
should proceed with caution when relying on cases that have negative
subsequent history. The analysis presented in a case that is not binding may still
be persuasive. See generally, Dunn, 254 Mich App at 264-266.
United States Supreme Court. Michigan courts are bound by “our state Suprem e
Court precedent, unless the United States Supreme Court has addressed a federal
iv
constitutional question.” People v Beasley, 239 Mich App 548, 559 (2000). “A
plurality opinion of the United States Supreme Court, however, is not binding
precedent.” Id., citing Texas v Brown, 460 US 730, 737 (1983).
Federal appellate and district courts. “Cases from foreign jurisdictions, whic h
are not binding, can be persuasive.” Bazzy v Citizens Ins Co of America, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up). Accordingly, state courts are not bound by the
decisions of lower federal courts construing federal law, and Michigan court s
“are free to follow or reject their authority.” People v Gillam, 479 Mich 253, 261
(2007).
Michigan Supreme Court. A Michigan “Supreme Court opinion become s
binding precedent for intermediate appellate and trial courts at the time a signed
opinion is date-stamped and filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court, unless”
the opinion “specifically states that the opinion is effective at a different date.”
Riley v Northland Geriatric Center, 425 Mich 668, 678 (1986). “‘The clear rule in
Michigan is that a majority of the [Michigan Supreme] Court must agree on a
ground for decision in order to make that binding precedent for future cases.’”
People v Sexton, 458 Mich 43, 65 (1998), quoting People v Anderson, 389 Mich 155,
170 (1973). See MCR 7.315(A) (“Except for affirmance of action by a lower court o r
tribunal by even division of the justices, a decision of the Court must be made by
concurrence of a majority of the justices voting.”). “Plurality decisions in whic h
no majority of the justices participating agree as to the reasoning are not a n
authoritative interpretation binding . . . under the doctrine of stare decisis.” Negri v
Slotkin, 397 Mich 105, 109 (1976). However, “a [plurality] decision rendered b y
less than four justices who nevertheless constitute a majority of a legally
constituted quorum is binding on the Court of Appeals and the trial courts.” Id. a t
106. “‘If there is merely a majority for a particular result, then the parties to the
case are bound by the judgment but the case is not authority beyond the
immediate parties.’” Sexton, 458 Mich at 65, quoting Anderson, 389 Mich at 170. I n
other words, “plurality opinions in which no majority of the participating justice s
agree with respect to the reasoning for the holding are not generally considered
authoritative interpretations that are binding under the doctrine of stare decisis.”
Auto Club Group Ins Co v Booth, 289 Mich App 606, 613 (2010).
For information regarding the precedential value of an order or judgment issued
by the Michigan Supreme Court, see the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Appeals &
Opinions Benchbook, Section 1.4(B).
Michigan Court of Appeals. “A published opinion of the Court of Appeals ha s
precedential effect under the rule of stare decisis.” MCR 7.215(C)(2). Accordingly ,
“the publication of an opinion of the Court of Appeals creates binding preceden t
until the Michigan Supreme Court enters a decision altering [the] Court’ s
decisions or its rationale.” Esordi v Macomb Twp, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025 )
(citation omitted). “A panel of the Court of Appeals must follow the rule of law
established by a prior published decision of the Court of Appeals issued on or
v
after November 1, 1990, that has not been reversed or modified by the Supreme
Court, or by a special panel of the Court of Appeals as provided in [MCR 7.215].”
MCR 7.215(J)(1). “Under the plain terms of MCR 7.215(C)(2), all published
decisions of [the] Court [of Appeals] issued prior to November 1, 1990, are
binding, precedential decisions under stare decisis.” Plachta, ___ Mich App at ___.
“They are not merely persuasive and are not on par with unpublished decisions. ”
Id. at ___. Although the Court of Appeals is “not strictly required to follo w
uncontradicted opinions . . . decided before November 1, 1990, those opinions are
nonetheless considered to be precedent and entitled to significantly greater
deference than are unpublished cases.” People v Bensch, 328 Mich App 1, 7 n 6
(2019) (quotation marks and citation omitted). See also People v Schurr, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ n 6 (2024) (stating “decisions published before November 1, 1990,
[are binding] only on the trial courts and only are precedent if uncontradicted”).
In other words, “there is no difference in the precedential effect of a pre- versu s
post-1990 decision.” Plachta, ___ Mich App at ___. “Instead, the only differenc e
between a pre- and post-November 1, 1990 decision is that the latter must be
followed by a subsequent panel unless it is overruled by a conflict panel or the
Supreme Court, while the former must be followed unless a subsequent three-
judge panel concludes it is distinguishable or warrants reversal.” Id. at ___.
For more information regarding the precedential nature of Court of Appeal s
opinions, see the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Appeals & Opinions Benchbook,
Section 1.4(C).

The original content of this benchbook was a chapter in the forme r
Michigan Circuit Court Benchbook, originally written by former Judge J.
Richardson Johnson. The benchbook was revised in 2009 and divided
into three separate benchbooks: Civil Proceedings, Criminal Proceedings,
and Evidence. Work on the 2010 edition of the Evidence Benchbook wa s
completed by MJI staff and overseen by an Editorial Advisor y
Committee. Similarly, MJI Research Attorney Danielle Y. Stackpol e
revised the 2021 revision and facilitated an Editorial Advisor y
Committee, while MJI Publications Manager Sarah Roth served as editor.

Using This Benchbook
This benchbook is intended for all Michigan judges. The purpose of thi s
benchbook is to provide a single source to address evidentiary issues tha t
may arise while the judge is on the bench. The benchbook is designed t o
be a ready reference, not an academic discussion. In that context, one o f
the most difficult challenges is organizing the text so that the user ca n
readily find any topic as it arises.
This book has underlying themes that may assist the user to understand
the overarching concepts around which the book is organized. This boo k
is based upon the following concepts:
• The focus is on process rather than substantive law
although substantive law is discussed when importan t
or necessary to decision making and the process as a
whole.
• The text covers the routine issues that a judge may face
and non-routine issues that require particular care whe n
they arise.
• The text is designed to encourage best practices rather
than minimal compliance.
• The text is intended to include the authority the judge
needs to have at his or her fingertips to make a decision.
• The text is designed to be read aloud or incorporated in
a written decision.
With these concepts in mind, the text is organized as follows:
• The format generally follows the sequence of the
Michigan Rules of Evidence.
• The format generally follows the typical sequence in
which issues arise during the course of a case.
• At the beginning of each chapter is a table of contents
that lists what is covered in the chapter.
• Sections in each chapter are identified by the word or
phrase typically used to identify the topic (a keywor d
concept).
viii
• The discussion of each topic is designed to move from
the general to the specific without undue elaboration.
• If the court is required to consider particular factors
when making a decision, every effort has been made t o
identify the necessary elements.
• Every effort has been made to cite the relevant Michigan
law using either the seminal case or the best curren t
authority for a body of law. United States Suprem e
Court decisions are cited when Michigan courts ar e
bound by that authority and they are the original source .
There are references to federal decisions or decision s
from other states when no applicable Michiga n
authority could be located.
• Every effort has been made to cite the source for each
statement (if no authority is cited for a proposition, the n
the statement is the author’s opinion or part of a
committee tip).
• If a proceeding or rule of evidence is based upon a
statute, reference to that authority is given in the text.
• If a model or standard jury instruction addresses an
issue, it is referenced in the text.

Section 1.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
1.1 Evidence—Overview
The admissibility of evidence is governed by the common law, statutes,
and the Michigan Rules of Evidence. See MRE 101. The rules of evidenc e
“should be construed so as to administer every proceeding fairly,
eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay, and promote the developmen t
of evidence law, to the end of ascertaining the truth and securing a jus t
determination.” MRE 102.
A. Applicability of the Rules of Evidence
The MREs “govern proceedings in Michigan courts”; “[t]he specifi c
courts and proceedings to which the rules apply, along wit h
exceptions, are set out in [MRE 1101].” MRE 101(a). “Except a s
otherwise provided in [MRE 1101(b)] or in a rule prescribed by th e
Supreme Court, [the MREs] apply to all Michigan court actions and
proceedings.” MRE 1101(a). Under MRE 1101(b), the MREs —
except for those on privilege — do not apply to the following:
1
• preliminary questions of fact ;
• grand jury proceedings;
• miscellaneous criminal proceedings (i.e., proceedings fo r
extradition or rendition; sentencing; granting or revoking
probation; issuing criminal summonses, arrest warrants,
and search warrants; and release on bail);
• contempt proceedings;
• small claims;
• in camera custody hearings;
• proceedings involving juveniles;
• preliminary examinations — property matters;
• domestic relations matters; and
• mental-health hearings. MRE 1101(b).
“The rules of evidence in civil actions, insofar as the same are
applicable, shall govern in all criminal and quasi criminal
proceedings except as otherwise provided by law.” MCL 768.22(1).
1Preliminary questions of fact involve “[t]he court's determination under [MRE 104(a)], on a preliminary
question of fact governing admissibility.” MRE 1101(b)(1).
Page 1-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.1
B. Admissibility Generally
Relevant evidence is admissible unless the United State s
Constitution, the Michigan Constitution, the MREs, or other rule s
prescribed by the Supreme Court provide otherwise. MRE 402.
“Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.” Id. “Evidence may also be
precluded by statute.” Hecht v Nat’l Heritage Academies, Inc, 499 Mic h
586, 618 (2016). See also MRE 101(b) (“[a] statutory rule of evidenc e
not in conflict with [the MREs] or other rules adopted by the
Supreme Court is effective until superseded by a Supreme Cour t
rule or decision.”)
Committee Tip:
The rules of evidence contain exclusionary rules
that typically state the exclusion and then
provide exceptions to the exclusion. For example,
the hearsay rule excludes hearsay (MRE 802) a s
evidence and then provides exceptions to th e
exclusion (MRE 803, MRE 803A, and MRE 804).
C. Conflict
When a conflict exists between a statute and a rule of evidence, the
rule of evidence “prevails if it governs purely procedural matters”
because the “authority to promulgate rules governing practice and
procedure in Michigan courts rests exclusively with [the Michigan]
Supreme Court.” Donkers v Kovach, 277 Mich App 366, 373 (2007). “A
statutory rule of evidence not in conflict with [the MREs] or other
rules adopted by the Supreme Court is effective until superseded by
a Supreme Court rule or decision.” MRE 101(b); People v McDonald,
2
201 Mich App 270, 273 (1993) (concluding that MCL 257.625a(9)
does not conflict with the rules of evidence because it does not allow
admission of the evidence for the purpose of establishing guilt, and
it requires the court to issue a jury instruction explaining how the
evidence is to be used).
See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Test for Admissibility and Rulin g
Flowchart for guidance regarding analyzing and ruling o n
evidentiary issues.
2 Formerly MCL 257.625a(7). The statute permits the admission of a person’s refusal to submit to a
chemical test for the limited purpose of showing that the test was offered to the person.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-3
Section 1.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
1.2 Motion in Limine
A motion in limine is “[a] pretrial request that certain inadmissibl e
evidence not be referred to or offered at trial. Typically, a party make s
this motion when it believes that mere mention of the evidence durin g
trial would be highly prejudicial and could not be remedied by a n
instruction to disregard.” Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed). In criminal
cases, the motion is often a motion to suppress. A motion in limine ma y
also be employed by a party seeking to gain admission of certai n
evidence, rather than suppress it. Motions in limine are most commonl y
made before trial; however, they may also be made and decided durin g
trial. See MRE 104. “To the extent practicable, the court must conduct a
jury trial so that inadmissible evidence is not suggested to the jury by an y
means.” MRE 103(d).
Neither the court rules nor the rules of evidence specifically provide for a
motion in limine by name. However, the practice is referenced in MRE
103(b), which provides that “[o]nce the court rules definitively on the
record — either before or at trial — a party need not renew an objection
or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.” In addition,
courts have the inherent discretion to decide preliminary evidentiar y
questions in either a civil or criminal case, and MRE 104(a) obligates a
trial court to resolve preliminary evidentiary questions by making a
determination about whether evidence is admissible. A court ma y
determine the scheduling of motions in limine through a final pretrial
conference and order. See MCR 2.401(H)(2)(a); MCR 6.001(D).
Committee Tip:
Care should be taken to not hastily decide a
motion in limine. At times, the context of the trial
provides a better basis to determine the
evidence’s admissibility. Often no harm results
by delaying the decision. However, an advance
decision may be warranted if the evidence is very
impactful.
See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Common Motions In Limine Table for a
list of situations where motions in limine are commonly used.
Page 1-4 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.3
1.3 Foundation
A. Lack of Personal Knowledge
“A witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced
sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal
knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge
may consist of the witness’s own testimony. [MRE 602] does no t
apply to a witness’s expert testimony under [MRE 703].” MRE 602.
B. Authenticating or Identifying Evidence
“To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an ite m
of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient t o
support a finding that the item is what its proponent claims it is. ”
MRE 901(a). “[C]hallenges to the authenticity of evidence involve
two related, but distinct, questions. The first question is whether the
evidence has been authenticated—whether there is sufficient reaso n
to believe that the evidence is what its proponent claims for
purposes of admission into evidence. The second question i s
whether the evidence is actually authentic or genuine—whether the
evidence is, in fact, what its proponent claims for purposes of
evidentiary weight and reliability.” Mitchell v Kalamazoo
Anesthesiology, PC, 321 Mich App 144, 154 (2017).
3
1. Question 1: Authentication or Identification
The first question, whether the evidence has bee n
authenticated, “is reserved solely for the trial judge.” Mitchell v
Kalamazoo Anesthesiology, PC, 321 Mich App 144, 154 (2017).
The proponent of that evidence bears the burden of showin g
that a foundation has been established, and must provid e
evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter i n
question is what the proponent claims it is. Id. at 155; MRE 901.
The proponent is not required “to sustain this burden in an y
particular fashion,” and “evidence supporting authenticatio n
may be direct or circumstantial and need not be free of al l
doubt.” Mitchell, 321 Mich App at 155. The proponent i s
required “only to make a prima facie showing that a
reasonable juror might conclude that the proffered evidence i s
what the proponent claims it to be.” Id. “Once the proponent of
the evidence has made the prima facie showing, the evidence i s
authenticated under MRE 901(a) and may be submitted to th e
jury. Mitchell, 321 Mich App at 155. Authentication may b e
opposed “by arguing that a reasonable juror could no t
3See Section 1.3(C) for discussion of self-authentication.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-5
Section 1.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
conclude that the proffered evidence is what the proponen t
claims it to be”; however, “this argument must be made on th e
basis of the proponent’s proffer,” and “the opponent may no t
present evidence in denial of the genuineness or relevance o f
the evidence at the authentication stage.” Id.
Committee Tip:
The best practice would be to conduct a hearing
regarding the authenticity of evidence outside
the presence of the jury. See MRE 103(d); People
v Berkey, 437 Mich 40, 46 (1991).
The following are examples only — not a complete list — of
evidence that satisfies the requirements of MRE 901(a):
• Testimony of Witness with Knowledge;
4
• Nonexpert Opinion About Handwriting;
• Comparison by an Expert Witness or the Trier o f
5
Fact;
• Distinctive Characteristics and the Like;
• Opinion About a Voice;
• Evidence About a Telephone Conversation;
• Evidence About Public Records;
• Evidence About Ancient Documents or Data
Compilation;
• Evidence About a Process or System; and
• Methods Provided by a Statute or Rule. MRE
901(b)(1)-(10).
In People v Jambor (Jambor I), 271 Mich App 1, 3-5 (2006), th e
prosecution sought to introduce into evidence four whit e
fingerprint cards, one of which contained the defendant’ s
latent fingerprint, allegedly removed from the scene of a break-
4 See Section 3.15 for a discussion of lay opinions.
5 See Section 4.1 for a discussion of expert opinions.
Page 1-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.3
in. The evidence technician who collected the latent print die d
before trial, and the prosecution attempted to authenticate th e
evidence by testimony from a police officer who observed th e
evidence technician collecting the prints at the crime scene. Id.
However, the witness testified that he only observed th e
technician working with black cards, not white ones, and th e
prosecution could offer no explanation for the inconsistency i n
the colors of the cards the witness observed and the cards th e
prosecution sought to admit at trial. Id. at 5-6. The Jambor I
Court concluded that the prosecution had failed under MRE
901 to lay a proper foundation for admitting the evidence and
affirmed the trial court’s order excluding it. Jambor I, 271 Mic h
App at 7. However, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed th e
Court of Appeals ruling:
“The exhibits were sufficiently authenticated a s
fingerprint cards relating to the offense, containing
complaint number, address, signature of the
preparing officer, and were referenced and
described in a report prepared by the officer a s
confirmed by a witness whose credibility was no t
questioned, thereby satisfying MRE 901.” People v
Jambor (Jambor II), 477 Mich 853 (2006).
When deciding whether a social-medial account is authentic,
courts should be mindful of concerns such as “fake social-
media accounts, hacked accounts, and so-called deep fakes[.] ”
People v Smith, 336 Mich App 79, 107 (2021). In Smith, th e
prosecutor relied on four Facebook posts made by non-
testifying third parties to “tease[] from the exhibits . . . tha t
defendant (pictured) was known by the nickname Brick Hea d
(written by someone next to the picture).” Id. at 108 (“th e
prosecutor did not use the posts solely as photographi c
evidence to identify defendant”). “Although a close call, . . . th e
trial court did not abuse it discretion by authenticating the fou r
Facebook posts” where an MDOC parole officer “established
that the exhibits were accurate depictions of what he claimed
they were–four Facebook posts that [the officer] viewed whe n
investigating defendant’s possible connection with th e
[crime]”; the officer “had personal knowledge of defendan t
and defendant’s affiliates, including those who were pictured
in the posts”; the officer “had known defendant as Brick Hea d
for ‘quite some time,’ which reinforced the authenticity of th e
posts that likewise connected defendant with that nickname”;
and there was “nothing on the face of the posts that would
suggest that they were faked or hacked so as to undermine th e
prima facie case for admission.” Id. at 109. “It was not an abus e
of discretion, therefore, for the trial court to conclude that a
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-7
Section 1.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
reasonable juror might conclude that the four exhibits wer e
what the prosecutor and [officer] claimed they were–th e
Facebook pages that the [officer] viewed, printed, and believed
were associated with defendant’s affiliates.” Id. at 109-110
(concluding, however, that three of the four exhibits wer e
improperly admitted because they consisted of hearsay fo r
which there was no exception, though the erroneous admissio n
was harmless given the cumulative nature of the hearsa y
evidence). “As technology advances, trial courts and lawyer s
will need to be vigilant when considering questions o f
authenticity, at both the first and second stages.” Id. at 110.
The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a sho e
and an insole containing the defendant’s DNA after concluding
that it was properly authenticated under MRE 901. See People v
Muhammad, 326 Mich App 40, 59 (2018). In Muhammad, the
defendant asserted that a shoe insole from which DN A
evidence was obtained had been contaminated when it wa s
photographed. Id. at 58. The shoe and insole were properl y
authenticated under MRE 901 and there was no evidence
showing that the insole was contaminated or tampered wit h
where “[t]he record showed that police stowed the shoe and
the insole in a sealed paper bag before sending the shoe to a . . .
[l]aboratory, and that after testing, the shoe and insole wer e
returned to the police department.” Muhammad, 326 Mich App
at 59. Thereafter, the detective “removed the insole from th e
shoe, wrapped the shoe insole in plastic, and returned th e
insole to the paper bag in plastic after taking photographs” and
“testified that defendant’s DNA samples were contained i n
separate plastic tubes.” Id.
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting a n
ultrasound image after concluding that it was properl y
authenticated under MRE 901(a). Mitchell, 321 Mich App at
156. A reasonable jury could conclude that the ultrasoun d
image was an actual depiction of the plaintiff’s procedur e
where “[t]he image showed a sticker that attached th e
ultrasound to the underlying progress note, and the sticke r
included plaintiff’s identifying information, the date of th e
procedure at issue, and the name of the doctor who performed
the surgery.” Id. Accordingly, “the digital image had distinctive
characteristics that tended to permit an inference that i t
depicted the ultrasound generated on the date at issue.” Id. a t
156-157, citing MRE 901(b)(4). Additionally, the imaging
supervisor testified that the ultrasound image, which was a
digital scan, “was made from the original record and was par t
of plaintiff’s medical record.” Mitchell, 321 Mich App at 157.
While the plaintiff “raised several sound arguments agains t
Page 1-8 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.3
the image’s authenticity, the evidence need not be free from all
doubt to be authenticated for purposes of admission[.]” Id.
Committee Tips:
Care should be taken not to demand too much
•
when it comes to authentication. Authentication
is a low, not high, burden to carry.
The method of authentication under MR E
•
901(b)(4), distinctive characteristics and the like
may seem counterintuitive. For example, the
contents of a letter may be used to establish the
author of a letter. This is a common form of
authentication of a letter, whether in hard copy,
text, email, or otherwise.
2. Question 2: Weight or Reliability Given to the
Evidence (Determination of Genuineness)
“[T]he second question—the weight or reliability (if any) give n
to the evidence—is reserved solely to the fact-finder[.] ”
Mitchell v Kalamazoo Anesthesiology, PC, 321 Mich App 144, 156
(2017). “When a bona fide dispute regarding the genuinenes s
of evidence is presented, that issue is for the jury, not the trial
court. Accordingly, the parties may submit evidence an d
argument, pro and con, to the jury regarding whether th e
authenticated evidence is, in fact, genuine and reliable.” Id.
(internal citation omitted)
“Once a proper foundation has been established, an y
deficiencies in the chain of custody go to the weight afforded t o
the evidence, rather than its admissibility.” People v White, 20 8
Mich App 126, 133 (1994) (holding that “a perfect chain of
custody is not required”; “evidence may be admitted wher e
the absence of mistaken exchange, contamination, o r
tampering has been established to a reasonable degree o f
probability or certainty”).
Where the trial court properly admitted an ultrasound imag e
under MRE 901(a), it “erred by precluding plaintiff fro m
arguing to the jury that the purported image was not, in fact,
an accurate digital scan of the original, i.e., that the image wa s
not genuine or reliable and therefore had little-to-no probativ e
value.” Mitchell, 321 Mich App at 157. The Court explained:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-9
Section 1.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“The trial judge’s role in examining the
genuineness and reliability of the image concluded
when he held that the image was admissible.
Where a bona fide dispute is presented on the
genuineness and reliability of evidence, the jury, a s
finder of fact, is entitled to hear otherwise
admissible evidence regarding that dispute.
Furthermore, any potential confusion to the jury
related to the chain-of-custody involving a non-
defendant could have been cured with a n
appropriate instruction by the trial judge. By
foreclosing plaintiff from presenting any evidence
disputing whether the image actually depicted
plaintiff’s procedure, the trial judge in effec t
determined that the image was indeed genuine
and reliable, even though such questions of
evidentiary weight are reserved for the jury.”
Mitchell, 321 Mich App at 157.
While evidentiary errors are not generally grounds fo r
reversal, the Court held that “substantial justice require[d]” i t
to reverse and vacate the judgment because the evidentiar y
error “involved a (arguably the) crucial piece of evidence. ”
Mitchell, 321 Mich App at 158.
Committee Tip:
A determination of genuineness and the weight
and credibility to give evidence remains with the
fact-finder irrespective of whether the evidenc e
falls under MRE 901(b) or MRE 902 (self-
authenticating evidence).
C. Self-Authenticating Evidence
The following items of evidence, found in MRE 902(1)-(11), are self-
authenticating and require no extrinsic evidence of authenticity i n
order to be admitted:
• Domestic Public Document That is Sealed and
Signed;
• Domestic Public Document That is Not Sealed but i s
Signed and Certified;
Page 1-10 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.4
• Foreign Public Document;
• Certified Copy of Public Record;
• Official Publication;
• Newspapers and Periodicals;
• Trade Inscription and the Like;
• Acknowledged Document;
• Commercial Paper and Related Documents;
• Presumptions Under Law; and
• Certified Domestic or Foreign Record of a Regularl y
Conducted Activity.
Committee Tip:
Compare the illustrative language of MRE 901(b)
discussed in Section 1.3(B)(1) with the list in MR E
902 discussed in this Section. The former is a list
of possibilities; the latter is a finite list.
1.4 Judicial Notice
Judicial notice is a substitute for proof. Winekoff v Pospisil, 384 Mich 260,
268 (1970). “The right to take judicial notice . . . does not mean that an y
such judicially noticeable matter is admissible in evidence. It must i n
addition be relevant as tending to prove or disprove the pleaded issue. ”
Id. at 266.
6
A. Adjudicative Facts
“The court may take judicial notice on its own and may require a
party to supply the necessary information.” MRE 201(c). Becaus e
“[t]aking judicial notice is discretionary,” refusing to do so i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Freed v Salas, 286 Mich App 300,
341 (2009).
6 MRE 201 only governs judicial notice of adjudicative facts. It “does not preclude judicial notice of legislative facts. ”
MRE 201(a) (emphasis added).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-11
Section 1.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the propriety
of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If
the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, o n
request, is still entitled to be heard.” MRE 201(e). “The court may
take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.” MRE 201(d).
Whenever judicial notice is taken, the jury must be instructed. See
MRE 201(f). “In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury t o
accept the noticed fact as conclusive.” Id. “In a criminal case, th e
court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the
noticed fact as conclusive.” Id.“
“The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject t o
reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial
court’s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readil y
determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
questioned.” MRE 201(b).
1. Allowed
Another court’s opinion or judgment. A trial court may tak e
judicial notice of another court’s authenticated opinion o r
judgment because it constitutes “prima facie evidence of all
facts recited therein in any other court of this state” pursuan t
to MCL 600.2106. In re Sumpter Estate, 166 Mich App 48, 5 7
(1988).
County in which a particular city is situated. A trial cour t
may take judicial notice of the county in which a particular cit y
is situated. See People v Stokes, 312 Mich App 181, 208 (2015),
7
vacated in part on other grounds 501 Mich 918 (2017)
(rejecting the defendant’s argument that his defense counsel
was ineffective for failing to contest the Wayne County Circui t
Court’s jurisdiction where testimony at the preliminar y
examination established that the crime occurred in Detroit and
no evidence was admitted specifically demonstrating tha t
Detroit is situated in Wayne County because “[t]he district and
circuit courts could take judicial notice of the fact that Detroit i s
situated within the borders of Wayne County”).
2. Not Allowed
Newspaper article. Courts “cannot take judicial notice of a
newspaper article for the truth of the matters asserted therei n
because of the general prohibition against inadmissibl e
hearsay.” Edwards v Detroit News, Inc, 322 Mich App 1, 4 n 2
7For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
Page 1-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.5
(2017). However, courts can “take notice of the fact that [ a
newspaper article was] published[.]” Id. (noting that th e
publication of two articles was “especially pertinent in a
defamation case implicating First Amendment principles,
where the inquiry focuse[d] on . . . what reasonable reader s
would have understood at the time the communication wa s
made and how a plaintiff’s reputation in the community wa s
impacted”).
B. Law
On its own, a court may take judicial notice of the common law ,
constitutions, statutes, Michigan ordinances and regulations,
private acts and resolutions of the United States Congress and of the
Michigan Legislature, and foreign laws. MRE 202(a). However,
judicial notice of these items becomes conditionally mandatory “if a
party so requests and: (1) supplies the court with sufficien t
information to enable it to properly to comply with the request; an d
(2) gives each adverse party such notice as the court may require t o
enable the adverse party to meet the request.” MRE 202(b). Failure
to judicially notice a statute under MRE 202(b) may be harmles s
error where “(1) the statute[] [was] admitted into evidence at trial
and [was] given to the jury for its consideration, (2) the jury wa s
correctly instructed regarding the law, and (3) the statute[] [was] a t
best only marginally relevant to the issues.” Koenig v City of Sout h
Haven, 221 Mich App 711, 728 (1997), rev’d on other grounds 46 0
8
Mich 667 (1999).
1.5 Burdens of Proof/Persuasion and Production
A. Generally
“The term ‘burden of proof’ is one of the ‘slipperiest member[s] of
the family of legal terms.’ Part of the confusion surrounding the
term arises from the fact that historically, the concept encompassed
two distinct burdens: the ‘burden of persuasion,’ i.e., which party
loses if the evidence is closely balanced, and the ‘burden of
production,’ i.e., which party bears the obligation to come forward
with the evidence at different points in the proceeding.” Schaffer v
Weast, 546 US 49, 56 (2005) (internal citations omitted; alteration i n
original).
8For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-13
Section 1.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
The burden of production may shift several times during a trial, bu t
the burden of persuasion generally remains with the plaintiff.
Widmayer v Leonard, 422 Mich 280, 290 (1985). However, the burde n
of persuasion may rest with the defendant as to particular defenses.
For example, a defendant claiming insanity bears the burden of
proving it by a preponderance of the evidence. MCL 768.21a.
B. Burden of Proof/Persuasion
The party with the burden of persuasion has the duty of
establishing the truth of the case according to the weight of evidenc e
required. McKinstry v Valley OB-GYN Clinic, PC, 428 Mich 167, 178-
179 (1987).
1. Preponderance of the Evidence
“Proof by a preponderance of the evidence requires that th e
factfinder believe that the evidence supporting the existence o f
the contested fact outweighs the evidence supporting it s
nonexistence.” Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Mich v Milliken, 42 2
Mich 1, 89 (1985).
2. Clear and Convincing Evidence
The intermediate burden of proof, clear and convincin g
evidence, has been defined as “evidence that ‘produce[s] in th e
mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to th e
truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence s o
clear, direct, and weighty and convincing as to enable [th e
factfinder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, o f
the truth of the precise facts in issue.’” In re Chmura (After
Remand), 464 Mich 58, 72 (2001), quoting In re Martin, 450 Mich
204, 227 (1995) (alterations in original).
3. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt
The highest burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. “I t
is a fundamental principle of our system of justice that a n
accused’s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt t o
sustain a conviction.” People v Hubbard, 387 Mich 294, 29 9
(1972). “A reasonable doubt is a fair, honest doubt growing ou t
of the evidence or lack of evidence. It is not merely a n
imaginary or possible doubt, but a doubt based on reason an d
common sense. A reasonable doubt is just that: a doubt that i s
reasonable, after a careful and considered examination of th e
9
facts and circumstances of [the] case.” M Crim JI 3.2(3).
Page 1-14 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.5
4. Other Burdens of Proof
There are other burdens of proof created by caselaw, cour t
rules, and rules of evidence. These typically relate to motion s
and evidentiary rulings.
Some motions require a showing of good cause. Example s
include:
• Adjournments. MCR 2.503(B)(1).
• Unendorsed witnesses. MCR 2.401(I)(2).
• Substitution of counsel. People v Ginther, 39 0
Mich 436, 441 (1973).
Another burden of proof is due diligence. Examples include:
• Requests for second summons. MCR 2.102(D).
• Failure to produce an endorsed witness. See
People v Eccles, 260 Mich App 379, 388 (2004).
C. Burden of Production (Burden of Going Forward)
“’The burden of producing evidence on an issue means the liability
to an adverse ruling (generally a finding or directed verdict) if
evidence on the issue has not been produced. It is usually cast firs t
upon the party who has pleaded the existence of the fact, but . . . the
burden may shift to the adversary when the pleader has discharged
his initial duty. The burden of producing evidence is a critical
mechanism in a jury trial, as it empowers the judge to decide the
case without jury consideration when a party fails to sustain the
burden.’” McKinstry v Valley OB-GYN Clinic, PC, 428 Mich 167, 17 9
(1987), quoting McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), §336, p 947. The party
with the burden of production has the duty of introducing sufficien t
evidence to have the relevant issue considered by the court.
McKinstry, 428 Mich at 179. Presumptions may affect the burden of
10
production. “The immediate effect of a presumption is to shift th e
burden of going forward with the evidence related to the presumed
fact.” Id. “[A] plaintiff carries the ultimate burden of persuasion and
must prove the elements of his or her claim, but a defendant carrie s
the burden of production on an affirmative defense. Once the
defendant comes forward with evidence for such a defense, then the
9 M Crim JI 3.2 must be given in its entirety in every criminal case. See M Crim JI 3.2, Use Note. Only
subsection (3) is referenced here.
10 See Section 1.6 for a discussion of presumptions.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-15
Section 1.6 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
plaintiff must produce evidence in response.” Law Offices of Jeffrey
Sherbow, PC v Fieger & Fieger, PC, 507 Mich 272, 305 (2021).
D. Standard of Review
A trial court’s instruction on the applicable burden of proof is a
question of law that is reviewed de novo. Stein v Home-Owners Ins
Co, 303 Mich App 382, 386-387 (2013).
1.6 Presumptions
A. Civil Case
“In a civil case, unless a statute or [the MREs] provide otherwise, th e
party against whom a presumption is directed has the burden of
producing evidence to rebut the presumption. But this rule does no t
shift the burden of persuasion, which remains on the party who had
it originally.” MRE 301. Because “the function of a presumption i s
solely to place the burden of producing evidence on the opposing
party,” it “allows a person relying on the presumption to avoid a
directed verdict, and it permits that person a directed verdict if the
opposing party fails to introduce evidence rebutting the
presumption.”Widmayer v Leonard, 422 Mich 280, 289 (1985).
“Almost all presumptions are made up of permissible inferences.
Thus, while the presumption may be overcome by evidence
introduced, the inference itself remains and may provide evidence
sufficient to persuade the trier of fact even though the rebutting
evidence is introduced. But always it is the inference and not the
presumption that must be weighed against the rebutting evidence.”
Widmayer, 422 Mich at 289. “[I]f the jury finds a basic fact, they mus t
also find the presumed fact unless persuaded by the evidence tha t
its nonexistence is more probable than its existence.” Id.
Once a judge concludes that the presumption has been rebutted, he
or she “should not instruct the jury regarding the presumption: it n o
longer exists. It has, instead, become a permissible inference on the
same level as any inference from the facts. Rather, the judge should
instruct the jury about the burden of proof and the underlying
facts.” State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co v Allen, 191 Mich App 18, 2 3
(1991).
B. Criminal Case
Presumptions in criminal cases are governed by MRE 302, whic h
provides:
Page 1-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.6
“(a) Scope. In a criminal case, [MRE 302] governs a
presumption against a defendant that is recognized a t
common law or is created by statute, includin g
statutory provisions that certain facts are prima faci e
evidence of other facts or of guilt
(b) Instructing the Jury. When a presumed fact against a
defendant is submitted to the jury, the court mus t
instruct the jury that:
(1) it may or may not conclude from the basic fact s
that the presumed fact is true; and
(2) the prosecution still bears the burden of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of
the offense.”
M Crim JI 3.2 must be given in every criminal case and states, in
relevant part:
“A person accused of a crime is presumed to b e
innocent. This means that you must start with th e
presumption that the defendant is innocent. Thi s
presumption continues throughout the trial and entitle s
the defendant to a verdict of not guilty unless you ar e
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that [he/she] i s
guilty.” M Crim JI 3.2(1).
C. Statutory Presumptions
In criminal cases, “[l]egislative [or statutory] presumptions are valid
so long as there is a rational connection between the proven fact s
and the fact to be presumed. If the presumed fact is more likely tha n
not to flow from the proven fact, the presumption is constitutionally
11
valid.” People v Dorris, 95 Mich App 760, 765 (1980) (internal
citations omitted). In Dorris, the defendants appealed thei r
conviction of being in possession of an incendiary device because
the prosecution had not proven unlawful intent. Id. The Court
concluded that presuming unlawful intent “was neither
unreasonable nor unconstitutional” because “incendiary device s
generally have no legal purpose” and “[i]t is more likely than no t
that one in possession of [an incendiary device] possesses [it] wit h
unlawful intent.” Id. at 765-766.
11 Constitutional concerns equivalent to those in a criminal proceeding may not be an issue in civil cases.
See McKinstry v Valley OB-GYN Clinic, PC, 428 Mich 167, 182-183 (1987) (finding that a civil litigant’ s
contractual choice-of-forum decision did not involve constitutional rights; further noting that waiving a
civil jury trial “is not tantamount to deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right” because “[t]he right
to a jury trial in a civil action is . . . permissive, not absolute”).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-17
Section 1.7 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“When the trial court undertakes to eliminate from the jury’ s
consideration a statutory presumption as a matter of law, at the very
least there must be clear, positive, and credible evidence opposing
the presumption.” White v Taylor Distrib Co, 275 Mich App 615, 62 1
(2007). For example, MCL 257.402(a) (rear-end collision statute )
provides that the offending driver is presumed to be guilty of
negligence. White, 275 Mich App at 621. However, this presumptio n
may be rebutted by showing an adequate excuse or justification for
the collision. Id.
1.7 Order of Proof
A. Generally
The trial court has discretion to determine the order of proof and the
sequence in which issues are tried. MRE 611(a); MCR 2.513(G).
B. Conditional Admission of Evidence
MRE 104(b) permits the admission of evidence conditioned upo n
12
subsequent proof of relevancy.
C. Rebuttal Evidence
“Rebuttal evidence is admissible to contradict, repel, explain or
disprove evidence produced by the other party and tending directly
to weaken or impeach the same.” People v Figgures, 451 Mich 390,
399 (1996) (internal citation and quotation omitted).
1. Criminal Case
“[A] prosecutor may not divide the evidence on which th e
people propose to rest their case, saving some for rebuttal. ”
People v Losey, 413 Mich 346, 351 (1982).
“[T]he test of whether rebuttal evidence was properl y
admitted is . . . whether the evidence is properly responsive t o
evidence introduced or a theory developed by the defendant, ”
and “depends on what proofs the defendant introduced and
not on merely what the defendant testified about on cross-
examination.” People v Figgures, 451 Mich 390, 399 (1996). “A s
long as evidence is responsive to material presented by th e
defense, it is properly classified as rebuttal, even if it overlap s
evidence admitted in the prosecutor’s case in chief.” Id.
12 See Section 2.1 on admissibility.
Page 1-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.8
2. Civil Case
“The scope of rebuttal in civil cases is within the soun d
discretion of the trial court.” Taylor v Blue Cross/Blue Shield of
Mich, 205 Mich App 644, 655 (1994). “‘[A] party may no t
introduce evidence competent as part of [its] case in chie f
during rebuttal unless permitted to do so by the court.’” Lim a
Twp v Bateson, 302 Mich App 483, 502 (2013) (the trial cour t
abused its discretion when it refused to allow the testimony o f
a rebuttal witness where the testimony could hav e
contradicted the opposing party’s evidence), quoting Winiemko
v Valenti, 203 Mich App 411, 418-419 (1994).
D. Reopening Proofs
Generally, whether to reopen proofs for a party rests within the
sound discretion of the trial judge. Bonner v Ames, 356 Mich 537, 54 1
(1959); People v Collier, 168 Mich App 687, 694 (1988). Relevant i n
ruling on a motion to reopen proofs in a civil case is “(1) the timin g
of the motion, (2) whether the adverse party would be surprised,
deceived, or disadvantaged by reopening the proofs, and (3)
whether there would be inconvenience to the court, parties, or
counsel.” Mich Citizens for Water Conservation v Nestle Waters Nort h
America Inc, 269 Mich App 25, 50-51 (2005), rev’d in part on othe r
13
grounds 479 Mich 280 (2007). In a criminal case, the relevan t
consideration is “whether any undue advantage would be taken b y
the moving party and whether there is any showing of surprise or
prejudice to the nonmoving party.” Collier, 168 Mich App at 694-695;
see also People v Herndon, 246 Mich App 371, 420 (2001).
1.8 Limitations on Evidence
Committee Tip:
The rules and cases discussed in this section do
not distinguish between jury and bench trials.
Where the court is serving as the fact finder,
there might be greater latitude in limiting
evidence where the court already has much of
the background information.
13For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-19
Section 1.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
A. Precluding a Witness From Testifying
1. Civil Cases
MCR 2.401(I)(2) allows a trial court to prohibit testimony fro m
witnesses not identified in a pretrial order or required witnes s
list.
“Trial courts should not be reluctant to allow unlisted
witnesses to testify where justice so requires, particularly wit h
regard to rebuttal witnesses.” Pastrick v Gen Tel Co of Mich, 16 2
Mich App 243, 245 (1987). The court may impose reasonabl e
conditions on allowing the testimony of an undisclosed
witness if there is no prejudice to the opposing party. Id. at 24 6
(finding that giving the “defendants an opportunity t o
interview the undisclosed witness and to secure their ow n
expert” were reasonable conditions in allowing th e
prosecutor’s undisclosed rebuttal witness to testify). The Cour t
also noted that a reasonable condition will normally include a
reasonable time frame. Id. at 246-247 n 1.
In deciding whether the court will sanction the party b y
precluding a witness from testifying, the court should conside r
the following factors on the record:
“(1) whether the violation was willful or
accidental; (2) the party’s history of refusing t o
comply with discovery requests (or refusal t o
disclose witnesses); (3) the prejudice to the
[opposing party]; (4) actual notice to the [opposing
party] of the witnesses and the length of time prior
to trial that the [opposing party] received suc h
actual notice; (5) whether there exists a history of
[the party] engaging in deliberate delay; (6) the
degree of compliance by the [party] with other
provisions of the court’s order; (7) an attempt by
the [party] to timely cure the defect; and (8)
whether a lesser sanction would better serve the
interests of justice. This list should not be
considered exhaustive.” Duray Dev, LLC v Perrin,
288 Mich App 143, 165 (2010) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted).
The trial court did not “abuse[] its discretion in denying [the ]
plaintiff’s motion to add [a new] expert witness,” which wa s
untimely filed “four days after the trial court had entered
its . . . order granting summary disposition in favor of [the]
defendants” and “more than one year and three months afte r
the due date for filing and serving witness lists.” Cox v
Page 1-20 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.8
Hartman, 322 Mich App 292, 312, 315 (2017). “[The] plaintif f
did not act diligently in pursuing [the] case”; furthermore, “th e
trial court reasonably concluded that [the] defendants woul d
be prejudiced in preparing for trial if the motion was granted. ”
Id. at 315-316 (further rejecting the plaintiff’s contention “tha t
she should be permitted to file an ‘amended’ affidavit of meri t
signed by a new expert witness pursuant to MCR
2.112(L)(2)(b),” because “amendment of the affidavit of meri t
would not affect or undermine the rationale or basis on whic h
summary disposition was granted,” i.e., that the “plaintif f
failed to present a standard-of-care expert who was qualified
to testify at trial”).
2. Criminal Cases
In criminal cases, discovery violations are addressed in MCR
6.201(J). Although that provision does not explicitly mentio n
precluding a witness from testifying, it does give the cour t
14
discretion to sanction discovery violations. In addition,
witness preclusion is an express remedy for violations o f
sequestration orders and failing to properly file an alibi o r
15
insanity defense. See e.g., People v Meconi, 277 Mich App 651,
654 (2008); MCL 768.21(1).
For discovery and sequestration order violations, “th e
exclusion of a witness is an extreme sanction that should not b e
employed if the trial court can fashion a different remedy tha t
will limit the prejudice to the party injured by the violatio n
while still permitting the witness to testify.” People v Rose, 289
Mich App 499, 526 (2010) (discovery violation). See als o
Meconi, 277 Mich App at 654 (sequestration).
Where an unlisted expert’s testimony was important to th e
defendant’s case and the prosecution would have ha d
adequate time to prepare for it, the trial court abused it s
discretion when it denied the defendant’s late request to add
the expert to the witness list. People v Yost, 278 Mich App 341,
380-381, 386 (2008) (the trial court’s decision to preclude th e
defense expert’s testimony did not fall within the range o f
reasonable and principled outcomes because without th e
expert’s testimony, the defendant was unable to establish a
defense regarding whether the victim actually died of a n
overdose; the defendant was also unable to contradict th e
14 See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 9, for mor e
information on discovery violations.
15 See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 10, for more
information on alibi and insanity defenses.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-21
Section 1.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
prosecutor’s assertions regarding the number of pills needed t o
cause an overdose without the expert’s testimony). “[G]ive n
the nature of the toxicology evidence against defendant, th e
trial court should have realized that the importance of th e
toxicologist to the defense substantially outweighed an y
prejudice that the prosecution might suffer in preparing for th e
late endorsement.” Id.
For alibi and insanity defense violations, the court mus t
“exclude evidence offered by the defendant for the purpose o f
establishing an alibi or the insanity of the defendant” if th e
written notice required by MCL 768.20 or MCL 768.20a is no t
filed and served, or if “the notice given by the defendant doe s
not state, as particularly as is known to the defendant or th e
defendant’s attorney, the name of a witness to be called i n
behalf of the defendant to establish” an alibi or insanit y
defense. MCL 768.21(1).
“Evidence of the discovery of, knowledge about, or potential
disclosure of an individual’s actual or perceived sex, gende r
identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation is no t
admissible for any of the following purposes:
(a) To demonstrate reasonable provocation.
(b) To show that an act was committed in a heat o f
passion.
(c) To support a defense of reduced mental
capacity under [MCL 768.20a].” MCL 768.21d(1).
Moreover, “an individual is not justified in using force agains t
another individual based on the discovery of, knowledg e
about, or potential disclosure of the victim’s actual or
perceived sex, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual
orientation.” MCL 768.21d(2). See the Michigan Judicial
Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 10, fo r
more information on alibi and insanity defenses.
B. Limitations on Questioning
“The court must exercise reasonable control over the mode and
order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to: (1 )
make those procedures effective for determining the truth; (2) avoi d
wasting time; and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undu e
embarrassment.” MRE 611(a).
Page 1-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.8
Committee Tip:
If the judge feels it is necessary to intervene and
limit the questioning of a witness, the judge
should tell the jury that he or she is not trying to
suggest any opinion about the case nor favor
one side, but merely trying to move the case
along.
1. Time Limitations on Witness Testimony
“MRE 611(a) grants a trial court broad power to control th e
manner in which a trial is conducted, including th e
examination of witnesses.” Hartland Twp v Kucykowicz, 18 9
Mich App 591, 595 (1991) (finding “the record show[ed] tha t
the trial court properly exercised its discretion in limiting th e
time for examination of witnesses,” where on the fifth day o f
trial, the court limited direct and cross-examination to one
hour each due to concerns about “the pace of cross-
examination, about counsel’s exploration of irrelevant issues,
and [his] tendency to pose the same questions over and over”);
see also People v Willis, 322 Mich App 579, 589 (2018).
The trial court’s decision to limit witness testimony to 1.5 hour s
was not an abuse of discretion where “counsel had adequat e
time to develop the facts and issues at the center of the parties ’
dispute” and “the trial court permitted [the plaintiff] mor e
than three hours for its examination of [one of its ke y
witnesses] on the basis of counsel’s pledge that he could
complete the rest of the witness examinations in a half hour. ”
Alpha Capital Mgt, Inc v Rentenbach, 287 Mich App 589, 61 8
(2010). The Court noted that it disapproves of “utterl y
arbitrary time limitations unrelated to the nature an d
complexity of a case or the length of time consumed by othe r
witnesses,” but found the time limitation was not arbitrary i n
the current case because it had been suggested by the plaintiff.
Id. at 618 n 12.
Contrast with Barksdale v Bert’s Marketplace, 289 Mich App 652,
657 (2010), where the trial court’s decision to limit witnes s
examination to 30 minutes per side was arbitrary and an abus e
of discretion when both sides quickly picked a jury, delivere d
opening statements, and the plaintiff’s attorney expeditiousl y
examined the plaintiff “without repetitive or irrelevan t
questions.” The Court of Appeals concluded that the facts i n
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-23
Section 1.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Barksdale were distinguishable from those in Alpha Capital Mgt,
and could “discern no reasonable basis for the trial court’ s
determination that limiting witness examinations to 3 0
minutes for each side advanced the trial-management goals se t
forth in MRE 611(a).” Barksdale, 289 Mich App at 657.
2. Time Limitations on Defendant’s Testimony
Restrictions on a defendant’s right to testify may not b e
arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they ar e
designed to serve. Rock v Arkansas, 483 US 44, 55-56 (1987) ( a
trial court “must evaluate whether the interests served by a
rule justify the limitation imposed on the defendant’ s
constitutional right to testify”).
3. Limitations on Cross-Examination
In controlling trial proceedings, a trial court may impos e
reasonable limits on cross-examination pursuant to MRE
611(a), even in a criminal case where the defendant has a
constitutional right to confrontation. People v Willis, 322 Mic h
App 579, 590-591 (2018).
Child victims of sexual assault.“MRE 611(a) allows the trial
court to prohibit a defendant from personally cross-examinin g
vulnerable witnesses—particularly children who have accuse d
the defendant of committing sexual assault. The court mus t
balance the criminal defendant’s right to self-representatio n
with the State’s important interest in protecting child sexual
abuse victims from further trauma.” People v Daniels, 311 Mic h
App 257, 269-271 (2015) (holding that the “trial court wisel y
and properly prevented defendant from personally cross-
examining [his children regarding their testimony that h e
sexually abused them], to stop the children from sufferin g
‘harassment or undue embarrassment,’” following “a motio n
hearing at which [the court] heard considerable evidence tha t
defendant’s personal cross-examination would cause [th e
children] significant trauma and emotional stress”) (quotin g
MRE 611(a); additional quotation marks and citation s
omitted). The defendant’s right to self-representation was no t
violated under these circumstances where the defendant wa s
instructed “to formulate questions for his [children], which hi s
advisory attorney then used to cross-examine them.” Daniels,
311 Mich App at 270.
Adult witnesses. In Willis, 322 Mich App at 589, the defendan t
argued that it was improper for the trial court to limit defens e
counsel’s cross-examination of a police sergeant “about th e
Page 1-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.8
sergeant’s incorrect assumption that defendant was prohibited
from being around schools pursuant to the Sex Offender s
Registration Act (SORA), . . . and purportedly belittlin g
defense counsel by reading out loud the substance of MRE 611
when issuing its ruling.” The Court of Appeals concluded tha t
“[t]he trial court’s remarks were not of such a nature as t o
16
unduly influence the jury.” Willis, 322 Mich App at 591. The
Court also found that the trial court “appropriately exercised
its discretion to control the trial to prevent imprope r
questioning of the sergeant and avoid wasting time” where th e
trial court and the parties discussed the parameters of th e
testimony before the sergeant took the stand and agreed t o
limit his testimony to his squad car video, the additiona l
questions defense counsel asked the sergeant were previousl y
covered in similar testimony, and the trial court read the cour t
rule to explain its interruptions of the testimony after firs t
cautioning defense counsel that the questions were “beyond
the redirect,” and “beyond what we’ve gone into and what I
said you should do or could cover on recross.” Id. at 591-592.
C. Limiting Cumulative Evidence
The court has discretion to exclude cumulative evidence. MRE 403.
Where a witness’s testimony “was entirely consistent with that of
several prior witnesses,” the trial court properly excluded it on the
basis of cumulative evidence. McDonald v Stroh Brewery Co, 19 1
Mich App 601, 608 (1991). However, “cumulative evidence whic h
rebuts the prosecutor’s case should be admissible if it assists the
defendant.” People v Norwood, 123 Mich App 287, 293 (1983) (finding
the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that the
testimony of two witnesses was “merely cumulative” where it
“would have been helpful to defendant, since their testimony
supported defendant’s account of the incident in several particular s
and would likely have enhanced his credibility in the eyes of the
jury”).
“Any error resulting from the exclusion of cumulative evidence i s
harmless.” Badiee v Brighton Area Sch, 265 Mich App 343, 357 (2005).
However, improperly admitted cumulative evidence is no t
automatically harmless error. People v Hamilton, 500 Mich 938 (2017 )
(vacating and remanding where the Court of Appeals determined
that because the witness’s testimony was arguably cumulative, it s
admission constituted harmless error).

Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 12.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-25
Section 1.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Committee Tip:
If employed by the court, two factors may help
uphold decisions on the limitations of proof and
arguments: (1) solicit input from counsel; and (2)
provide sufficient advance notice.
1.9 Privileges
A. Source and Scope
“The common law governs a claim of privilege, unless a statute or
court rule provides otherwise.” MRE 501. “Unlike other evidentiary
rules that exclude evidence because it is potentially unreliable,
privilege statutes shield potentially reliable evidence in an attemp t
to foster relationships.” People v Stanaway, 446 Mich 643, 658 (1994).
“While the assurance of confidentiality may encourage
relationships of trust, privileges inhibit rather than facilitate the
search for truth. Privileges therefore are not easily found or
endorsed by the courts. The existence and scope of a statutory
privilege ultimately turns on the language and meaning of the
statute itself. Even so, the goal of statutory construction is t o
ascertain and facilitate the intent of the Legislature.” Id. (quotatio n
marks and citations omitted).
See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Commonly-Recognized Privileges
Table for more information on various types of privileges.
Committee Tip:
When presented with an asserted privilege, the
court may consider employing the following
analysis:
What privilege is claimed?
•
Was there a relationship covered by the
•
privilege?
Was there a communication covered by the

B. Assertion of Privilege
1. Invoking a Privilege
Generally, criminal defendants and civil litigants lack th e
standing to assert a privilege on behalf of a third party. People v
Wood, 447 Mich 80, 89 (1994). For example, a hospital or a
physician may not invoke a patient’s physician-patien t
privilege on behalf of the patient where the patient has n o
desire to invoke the privilege. Samson v Saginaw Bldg Prof, Inc,
44 Mich App 658, 670 (1973).
Similarly, a defendant does not have standing to raise an issu e
on appeal regarding another witness’s testimonial privilege.
People v Allen, 310 Mich App 328, 344 (2015), rev’d on othe r
17
grounds 499 Mich 307 (2016). The Court held that th e
defendant lacked standing to challenge the trial court’s failur e
to expressly inform his testifying spouse that she could invok e
her spousal privilege, but noted that “nothing should sto p
counsel for the defendant-spouse from raising an objectio n
[during trial] to the witness-spouse’s testimony to ensure tha t
she knows she cannot be required to testify against th e
defendant-spouse.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).
2. Determining the Validity of a Claim
A trial court must follow an established procedure when i t
discovers that a potential witness plans to invoke a testimonia l
privilege. People v Paasche, 207 Mich App 698, 709 (1994). I n
Paasche, the Court of Appeals explained how trial court s
should handle these situations:
“First, a trial court must determine whether the
witness understands the privilege and mus t
provide an adequate explanation if the witnes s
does not. The court must then hold an evidentiary
17For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-27
Section 1.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
hearing outside the jury’s presence to determine
the validity of the witness’ claim of privilege. If the
court determines the assertion of the privilege t o
be valid, the inquiry ends and the witness i s
excused.
If the assertion of the privilege is not legitimate i n
the opinion of the trial judge, the court must the n
consider methods to induce the witness to testify,
such as contempt and other proceedings. If the
witness continues to assert the privilege, the cour t
must proceed to trial without the witness, because
there is no other way to prevent prejudice to the
defendant.” Paasche, 207 Mich App at 709-710
(internal citations omitted).
Committee Tip:
Where there is a claim of privilege under the
Fifth Amendment, some courts offer to appoint
an attorney for the witness, or allow the witness
to bring in his or her own attorney if time
permits before making a determination on the
validity of the claim. Counsel should remain until
the witness is excused from testifying or
completes the testimony.
“[T]he trial court complied with the applicable procedure and
properly ordered that [the witness] could not be called” t o
testify where the prosecutor informed the trial court at a
pretrial hearing that the witness might assert his privileg e
against self-incrimination if he testified at trial and the tria l
court appointed counsel for the witness and later held a
hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whethe r
the witness intended to invoke the privilege. People v
Steanhouse, 313 Mich App 1, 18 (2015), aff’d in part and rev’d i n
18
part on other grounds 500 Mich 453 (2017). While the trial
court “did not question [the witness] or make an explici t
determination on the record concerning the validity of [th e
witness’s] assertion of the privilege,” it “conducted an inquir y
with [the witness’s] appointed counsel, who indicated that h e
had counseled [the witness] regarding his Fifth Amendmen t
privilege, and that [the witness] had decided not to testify.” Id.
18For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Page 1-28 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.9
at 18-19. The witness’s counsel explained that he advised th e
witness not to testify “based on the ‘potentially dangerous ’
nature of [the witness’s] prospective testimony—[the witness’s ]
inconsistent statements to the police and possible testimon y
that he was present when the assault occurred.” Id. at 1 9
(noting that the trial court was accordingly aware of the factua l
basis that supported the assertion of the privilege and that an y
further questioning may have incriminated the witness).
Moreover, the Court also found it “significant that, before trial,
the trial court provided defense counsel with an opportunity t o
further question [the witness’s] appointed counsel regardin g
[the witness’s] intent to assert his Fifth Amendment righ t
against self-incrimination, but defense counsel did not avai l
19
himself of that opportunity[.]” Id.
3. Discovery
a. Civil Cases
In civil cases, privileged material may not be obtained
through discovery. MCR 2.302(B)(1). If a party knows
before his or her deposition that he or she will assert a
privilege, the party must move to prevent the taking of
the deposition or be subject to costs under MCR 2.306(G).
MCR 2.306(D)(4). A party must assert a privilege at his or
her deposition or lose it. MCR 2.306(D)(5). If the privilege
is asserted, the party may not, at trial, offer his or her
testimony on the evidence objected to during the
deposition. Id.
But see MCL 330.1750(2) (psychiatrist/psychologist-
patient privilege) and MCL 600.2157 (physician-patien t
privilege), which require disclosure of, or indicate the
waiver of, certain privileged communications in specifi c
circumstances. However, “[i]nformation regarding
nonparty patients sought in the discovery process fall s
within the scope of the physician-patient privilege.” Meie r
v Awaad, 299 Mich App 655, 678 (2013) (trial court erre d
(1) in ordering enforcement of a subpoena requesting the
names and addresses of all Medicaid beneficiaries wh o
were treated for a specific disease by defendant doctor
and coded as having been diagnosed with a specifi c
disease, and (2) in entering a protective order setting ou t
the permissible uses of the patient information and
authorizing plaintiffs’ counsel to contact individual
19For additional discussion of protection from self-incrimination, see Section 3.13.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-29
Section 1.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
patients identified in materials submitted in response t o
the subpoena).
b. Criminal Cases
“[T]he right to access discovery in a criminal case is no t
absolute.” People v Wisniewski, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025). In criminal cases, privileged information is
20
generally not discoverable. MCR 6.201(C)(1). However,
if the “defendant demonstrates a good-faith belief,
grounded in articulable fact, that there is a reasonable
probability that records protected by privilege are likely
to contain material information necessary to the defense,
the trial court shall conduct an in camera inspection of the
records.” MCR 6.201(C)(2). MCR 6.201(C)(2)(a)-(e)
explain how the court should proceed once an in camera
inspection has been conducted.
A defendant’s motion for discovery of a complainant’ s
privileged medical, psychological, and school records i s
properly denied by a trial court where the record s
reviewed in camera do not contain material necessary t o
the defense. People v Masi, 346 Mich App 1, 26, 27 (2023).
An in camera review should not be conducted when “the
party seeking disclosure is on a fishing expedition to see
what may turn up.” People v Davis-Christian, 316 Mic h
App 204, 208 (2016) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted). “A defendant ‘is fishing’ for information whe n
he or she relies on generalized assertions and fails to state
any ‘specific articulable fact’ that indicates the privileged
records are needed to prepare a defense.” Id. at 208,
quoting People v Stanaway, 446 Mich 643, 681 (1994).
In Stanaway, the Court rejected defendant’s assertion tha t
review of confidential records was “necessary to hi s
attempt to unearth any prior inconsistent statement s
made by the complainant or any other relevant rebuttal
evidence,” finding that defendant was “fishing”; had
failed to state “any specific articulable fact that would
indicate that the requested confidential communication s
were necessary to a preparation of his defense”; and had
failed to state “a good-faith basis for believing that suc h
statements were ever made or what the content might be
and how it would favorably affect his case.” Id. at 681.
20 Effective May 1, 2020, MCR 6.201(C) is applicable to both felonies and misdemeanors. See MCR
6.001(A); MCR 6.610(E)(1), amended by ADM File No. 2018-23.
Page 1-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.9
In Davis-Christian, the trial court abused its discretion i n
granting the defendant’s motion for an in camera review
of the complainant’s counseling records where the
defendant did not demonstrate that the records “would
be ‘necessary to the defense’” as required by MCR
6.201(C)(2). Davis-Christian, 316 Mich App at 209, 212. The
trial court “explicitly disregarded Stanaway and
articulated its own standard” which would
impermissibly “allow an in camera review of most–if no t
all–of the counseling records of alleged sexual assaul t
21
victims.” Id. at 209, 213 (the Court noted that th e
defendant had “access to the police report and forensi c
interview” of the victim, which gave him “the
information necessary to properly prepare a defense,”
and that his “assertion of need merely voice[d] a hope of
corroborating evidence, untethered to any articulable
facts”).
Courts must reject “any attempt by a criminal defendan t
to articulate ‘a generalized assertion of a need,’ . . . t o
undermine and attack the credibility of his accuser as a
justification for an in camera review of records subject t o
the counselor-patient privilege.” Wisniewski, ___ Mic h
App at ___, quoting Stanaway, 446 Mich at 650. “Instead, a
defendant is required to meet the threshold showing of
establishing a reasonable probability that the record s
contained information material to his defense t o
overcome the statutory privileges at issue.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up). In Wisniewski, “defendant speculated tha t
the privileged counseling records could contai n
information helpful to his defense, but he did not identify
any specific articulable facts or good-faith basis t o
indicate that [the victim’s] counseling records actually
would contain such helpful information.” Id. at ___.
“Aside from self-serving and conclusory allegations tha t
[the victim had] an unspecified mental-health condition,
and that her demeanor at the preliminary examinatio n
was unusual, defendant [failed to] put forth concrete fact s
establishing a reasonable probability that her counseling
records contained information material to his defense.”
Id. at ___ (noting that while the victim “did appear t o
stumble and struggle upon rapid-fire and aggressive
questioning from defense counsel,” her preliminary
21The standard articulated by the trial court, and rejected by the Court of Appeals, centered on relevance.
Davis-Christian, 316 Mich App at 209. The trial court explained that the counseling records were relevant
because they might contain information to “put[] him behind bars or free[] him[.]” Id. Accordingly, the trial
court stated that it was “going to read [the records] and say yea or nay.” Id.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-31
Section 1.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
examination testimony was “largely . . . clear, cogent, and
articulate”). Accordingly, “the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion by denying defendant’s motion for an in camera
review of [the victim’s] counseling records as defendan t
did not establish a reasonable probability that the
privileged records were likely to contain material
information necessary to his defense.” Id. at ___.
c. Inadvertent Disclosure
Privileged information that is inadvertently disclosed and
thereafter used by the parties may become discoverable
despite the fact that it would not generally be
discoverable. Landin v Healthsource Saginaw, Inc, 305 Mic h
App 519, 536 (2014). The trial court did not abuse it s
discretion when it denied the defendant’s motion t o
compel return of confidential non-party medical record s
when the defendant was aware of the disclosure of the
records “for well over a year before contending that they
were protected by privilege and seeking their return.” Id.
at 536-537. In declining the defendant’s request for relief,
the Court of Appeals further noted that inspection of the
medical records was necessary to the resolution of the
parties’ dispute. Id.
C. Waiver
Generally, the right to waive a privilege belongs to the individual
making the communication. For example, only the patient may
waive the physician-patient privilege. Dorris v Detroit Osteopathic
Hosp Corp, 460 Mich 26, 34 (1999). Similarly, only the client may
waive the attorney-client privilege. Leibel v Gen Motors Corp, 25 0
Mich App 229, 240 (2002). But see MCL 600.2162(5)-(7), whic h
provides that the decision whether to waive the spousal
communication privilege in certain types of cases rests with the
spouse whose testimony is sought, not necessarily the spouse wh o
made the communication.
Voluntary disclosure of privileged materials to a third party
generally results in waiver of the privilege because “such actio n
necessarily runs the risk the third party may reveal it, either
inadvertently or under examination by an adverse party[.]”
D’Alessandro Contracting Group, LLC v Wright, 308 Mich App 71, 8 1
(2014) (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, thi s
“principle is not ironclad[.]” Id. “[W]here work product is prepared
for certain third parties, the qualified privilege may be retained.”
Id.; MCR 2.302(B)(3)(a) (work product prepared by or for anothe r
party or another party’s representative is privileged material).
Page 1-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.10
Further, even when material is not prepared by or for a specifi c
party, disclosure to a third party will not result in waiver when the
“common-interest doctrine” applies. D’Alessandro Contractin g
Group, LLC, 308 Mich App at 82, 84 (finding that even thoug h
“courts in this state have not expressly addressed the so-called
common-interest doctrine,” federal “application of the common-
interest doctrine [was] instructive . . . because both the state and
federal rules recognizing the work-product doctrine are ‘virtually
identical’”). Thus, “the disclosure of work product to a third party
does not result in a waiver if there is a reasonable expectation of
confidentiality between the transferor . . . and the recipient . . . .” Id.
at 82, 84-88 (holding that the common-interest doctrine applied and
the work product privilege was not waived because the defendant s
had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality in sharing the repor t
with the third party where the defendants and the third party had
an indemnification agreement).
The federal common-interest doctrine similarly applies t o
Michigan’s attorney-client privilege in limited circumstances. Nas h
Estate v Grand Haven, 321 Mich App 587, 598 (2017). It applies only
“where the parties undertake a joint effort with respect to a commo n
legal interest, and the doctrine is limited strictly to those
communications made to further an ongoing enterprise.” Id. at 596
(quotation marks and citation omitted; applying the common-
interest doctrine to exempt from disclosure under FOIA certai n
communications between the defendant-city’s attorney and other
“attorneys representing common legal interests made in connectio n
with facilitating professional legal services related to” property
involved in underlying tort litigation, even though the city was not a
party to the underlying tort litigation).
1.10 Missing Physical Evidence
A. Civil Case
Under certain circumstances, a fact-finder either must presume or
may infer that missing, lost, or destroyed evidence operates agains t
the party who misplaced, destroyed, or failed to produce it. A n
adverse presumption arises from intentional and fraudulent conduct,
while an adverse inference is permissible under M Civ JI 6.01(d) for a
failure to produce evidence with no reasonable excuse. Ward v
Consol Rail Corp, 472 Mich 77, 84-86 (2005). “A jury may draw a n
adverse inference against a party that has failed to produce
evidence only when: (1) the evidence was under the party’s control
and could have been produced; (2) the party lacks a reasonable
excuse for its failure to produce the evidence; and (3) the evidence i s
material, not merely cumulative, and not equally available to the
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-33
Section 1.10 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
other party.” Ward, 472 Mich at 85-86. See also Komendat v Gifford,
334 Mich App 138, 150 (2020) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted) (holding “a spoliation instruction is warranted if th e
evidence that is the subject of the instruction is (1) material, (2) no t
merely cumulative, and (3) not equally available to the opposite
party”). In Ward, the defendant introduced evidence that missing
evidence was disposed of as part of a routine business practice,
thereby rebutting the presumption that the missing evidence wa s
intentionally made unavailable. Ward, 472 Mich at 82. The Cour t
held that “the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that i t
could draw an adverse inference, but failed to explain that n o
inference should be drawn if [the jury concluded that the]
defendant had a reasonable excuse for its failure to produce the
evidence.” Id. at 80.
“‘Even when an action has not been commenced and there is only a
potential for litigation, the litigant is under a duty to preserve
evidence that it knows or reasonably should know is relevant to the
action.’” Pugno v Blue Harvest Farms, LLC, 326 Mich App 1, 25 (2018),
quoting Brenner v Kolk, 226 Mich App 149, 162 (1997) (“the trial cour t
did not abuse its discretion by providing [a] spoliation instruction ”
where defendant’s “failure to preserve the pallets [that fell and
struck plaintiff] deprived plaintiff of the opportunity to inspect a
possible cause of the collapse”).
A party may be sanctioned for spoliation of evidence even thoug h
the evidence was not technically lost or destroyed. Bloemendaal v
Town & Country Sports, Inc, 255 Mich App 207, 212 (2002). I n
Bloemendaal, the plaintiff’s experts failed to conduct a test on a piec e
of evidence during disassembly “that was essential to their ultimate
theory of liability.” Id. at 214. The Court concluded that failure t o
conduct the test amounted to a failure to preserve the evidence. Id.
Because the defendants were precluded from conducting their ow n
tests (which could only be done while the evidence was being
disassembled), they were severely prejudiced and dismissal wa s
appropriate where the trial court considered “other remedies and
concluded that they were insufficient to overcome the prejudice[.]”
Id. at 214-215 (the Court noted that even though dismissal is a
possible sanction, it is a drastic step that should be taken cautiously
and only after evaluating all other available options on the record).
B. Criminal Case
The failure to preserve or produce material exculpatory evidence
violates a defendant’s due process rights. Arizona v Youngblood, 48 8
US 51, 57 (1988). “To warrant reversal on a claimed due proces s
violation involving the failure to preserve evidence, ‘a defendan t
must prove that the missing evidence was exculpatory or that law
Page 1-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.10
enforcement personnel acted in bad faith.’” People v Richards, 31 5
Mich App 564, 581 (2016), rev’d on other grounds 501 Mich 921
22
(2017), quoting People v Hanks, 276 Mich App 91, 95 (2007). Th e
defendant bears the burden of showing that the evidence wa s
exculpatory or that the police acted in bad faith. Id. It is the trial
court’s responsibility, not the jury’s, to determine whether the
missing evidence was destroyed in bad faith. People v Cress, 46 6
Mich 883 (2002).
The defendant failed to demonstrate that the evidence wa s
exculpatory where the evidence at issue was saliva that only could
have been subjected to testing. Richards, 315 Mich App at 582-583 .
Accordingly, because the defendant could only show that the
evidence was potentially exculpatory, he was required t o
demonstrate bad faith on the part of the officers who failed t o
preserve the evidence. Id. The defendant failed to demonstrate bad
faith where the prison’s standard operating procedures for
23
collecting saliva evidence were followed, and the prison lacked
the equipment to preserve saliva for DNA testing purposes. Id. a t
583-584.
The defendant was not deprived of due process where the police
failed to preserve a balloon that contained heroin. People v Dickinson,
321 Mich App 1, 15 (2017). The defendant argued that the balloo n
should have been preserved “because DNA testing [of the balloon]
may have provided a basis for the jury to doubt that she possessed
and delivered the heroin.” Id. at 16-17. However, the “defendan t
concede[d] that the balloon was only ‘potentially exculpatory.’” Id.
at 17. Further, the record contained no evidence that the police
destroyed the balloon in bad faith; rather, the balloon was disposed
of “according to standard police protocol for processing suc h
evidence.” Id. “Moreover, the overwhelming evidence at trial
established that defendant possessed and passed the heroin to [a
prisoner]. Consequently, even if the balloon had been tested for
DNA and someone else’s DNA (rather than defendant’s) was found
on it, the test results would have made no difference to the outcome
of the case.” Id.
“Absent intentional suppression or a showing of bad faith, a loss of
evidence that occurs before a defense request for its productio n
does not require reversal.” People v Jones, 301 Mich App 566, 58 0
22For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
23Testimony was presented that the prison’s procedure for collecting saliva evidence was to photograph
the saliva on the person’s skin or clothing and then have the person clean off the saliva as quickly a s
possible to prevent the transfer of communicable diseases. Richards, 315 Mich App at 583-584. Testimon y
also established that clothing is not collected when it has small amounts of saliva on it, such as the clothin g
at issue in Richards. Id. at 584.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-35
Section 1.11 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(2013). “The defendant bears the burden of showing that the
evidence was exculpatory or that the police acted in bad faith.” Id. a t
581. In Jones, 301 Mich App at 569, the police found marijuana in the
defendant’s car following a traffic stop. The defendant argued tha t
she was “entitled to dismissal of the charges because the police
destroyed the recording of her roadside stop, and that the
destruction amounted to a violation of due process and prevented
her from presenting a meaningful defense.” Id. at 580. However, i t
was police department policy to automatically destroy all traffi c
stop recordings six months after the date of the traffic stop, and the
defendant was arrested after the recording had already bee n
destroyed. Id. at 581. Further, the defendant “failed to present an y
evidence of bad faith on the part of the police department and failed
to provide any evidence that the recording would have bee n
exculpatory.” Id. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to dismiss. Id.
1.11 Circumstantial Evidence
“Circumstantial evidence is evidence of a fact, or a chain of facts o r
circumstances, that, by indirection or inference, carries conviction to th e
mind and logically or reasonably establishes the fact to be proved.
Circumstantial evidence may sustain criminal convictions, but th e
circumstantial proof must facilitate reasonable inferences of causation,
not mere speculation.” People v Wang, 505 Mich 239, 251 (2020) (quotatio n
marks, alteration, and citation omitted). See also M Crim JI 4.3; M Civ J I
3.10.
1.12 Weight of Evidence
“[A] jury is free to credit or discredit any testimony.” Kelly v Builders
Square, Inc, 465 Mich 29, 39 (2001). “That the [witnesses] involved . . . ar e
professional observers [(physicians, in this case)] does not change th e
rule that their eyewitness testimony may be disbelieved by a jury.” Taylo r
Estate v Univ Physician Group, 329 Mich App 268, 285 (2019).
1.13 Standard of Review
“A trial court’s decision to admit evidence ‘will not be disturbed absen t
an abuse of . . . discretion.’” People v Musser, 494 Mich 337, 348 (2013),
quoting People v McDaniel, 469 Mich 409, 412 (2003). In reviewing
evidentiary decisions, “[a]n abuse of discretion is found only if a n
unprejudiced person, considering the facts on which the trial court acted,
would say that there was no excuse for the ruling made.” People v Aldrich,
246 Mich App 101, 113 (2001). However, “[a] decision on a clos e
evidentiary question ordinarily cannot be an abuse of discretion.” Id.
Page 1-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 1.13
Committee Tip:
The abuse of discretion standard is highly
deferential to the trial court’s decision.
Additionally, close evidentiary calls are typically
not the subject of an abuse of discretion. These
points underscore the importance of: (1)
recognition by the trial court of its discretion ;
and (2) a clear record reflecting the court’s
decisional process.
If the decision involves a preliminary question of law, such as th e
meaning of a rule of evidence or whether a rule of evidence or statut e
precludes the admission of the evidence, it is reviewed de novo. Waknin v
Chamberlain, 467 Mich 329, 332 (2002); People v Katt, 468 Mich 272, 27 8
(2003). “Therefore, when such preliminary questions are at issue, . . . a n
abuse of discretion [will be found] when a trial court admits evidenc e
that is inadmissible as a matter of law.” Katt, 468 Mich at 278.
“An error in the admission or the exclusion of evidence is not a ground
for reversal unless refusal to take this action appears inconsistent wit h
substantial justice. Under this rule, reversal is required only if the error i s
prejudicial. The defendant claiming error must show that it is mor e
probable than not that the alleged error affected the outcome of the trial
in light of the weight of the properly admitted evidence.” People v
McLaughlin, 258 Mich App 635, 650 (2003) (internal citations omitted). Se e
also MRE 103(a); MRE 103(e). “An error is outcome determinative if i t
undermined the reliability of the verdict and, in making thi s
determination, a court should focus on the nature of the error in light o f
the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.” Musser, 494 Mich a t
348 (quotation marks and citations omitted).

Section 2.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
2.1 Admissibility
A. Preliminary Question Concerning Admissibility
“The court must decide any preliminary question about whether a
witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible. I n
so deciding, the court is not bound by evidence rules, except those
on privilege.” MRE 104(a).
B. Who Decides Specific Admissibility Questions
1. Exhibits
“Ordinarily, the court determines whether the proponent ha s
fulfilled the factual conditions for admitting other evidence o f
the content of a writing, recording, or photograph under [MRE
1004] or [MRE 1005]. But in a jury trial, the jury determines —
in accordance with [MRE 104(b)] — any issue about whether:
(a) an asserted writing, recording, or photograph ever existed;
(b) another one produced at the trial or hearing is the original;
or (c) other evidence of content accurately reflects the content. ”
MRE 1008.
2. Other Evidence
When the evidence is of a kind other than the “contents of
writings, recordings, or photographs” as addressed by MRE
1008, some preliminary questions are for the judge and some
questions are for the jury. People v Vega, 413 Mich 773, 778-77 9
(1982), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated i n
People v Barrett, 480 Mich 125 (2008). “[P]reliminary question s
of conditional relevance envisioned by [MRE] 104(b)
[(relevancy depends upon the fulfillment of a condition o f
fact)] are those which present no . . . danger of prejudice to th e
defendant. They are questions of probative force rather tha n
evidentiary policy. They involve questions as to the fulfillmen t
of factual conditions which the jury must answer,” unlike MRE
1008, which provides such questions are ordinarily for th e
court to decide when the evidence involves the contents o f
writings, recordings, or photographs. Vega, 480 Mich at 778-77 9
(quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis added). “Th e
standard for screening evidence under [MRE 104](b) is quit e
low.” Howard v Kowalski, 296 Mich App 664, 682 (2012), rev’d i n
1
part 495 Mich 982 (2014). “[A]s long as some rational jury

note.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.1
could resolve the issue in favor of admissibility, the court mus t
let the jury weigh the disputed facts. Specifically, the cour t
must allow the jurors to assess the credibility of the evidenc e
presented by the parties.” Howard, 296 Mich App at 683.
C. Stay Pending Appeal Following Admissibility Decision
“The mechanics of interlocutory appeals are entirely the product of
court rules promulgated by [the Michigan Supreme] Cour t
pursuant to [its] constitutional imperative to ‘establish, modify ,
amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of thi s
state.’” People v Scott, 513 Mich 180, 186 (2024), quoting Const 1963,
art 6, § 5.
“Where the court makes a decision on the admissibility of evidence
and the prosecutor or the defendant files an interlocutory
application for leave to appeal seeking to reverse that decision, the
court shall stay proceedings pending resolution of the application i n
the Court of Appeals, unless the court makes findings that the
evidence is clearly cumulative or that an appeal is frivolous because
legal precedent is clearly against the party’s position. If the
application for leave to appeal is filed by the prosecutor and the
defendant is incarcerated, the defendant may request that the cour t
reconsider whether pretrial release is appropriate.” MCR 6.126.
“While an automatic stay does not necessarily prevent a court fro m
commencing trial when an interlocutory appeal is pending and the
question on review is collateral to the trial,” failure to adhere to the
automatic stay during an interlocutory appeal is a procedural error.
Scott, 513 Mich at 202. According to Scott, “Interlocutory appeals, i n
contrast to appeals from final orders, do not divest a trial court of
subject-matter jurisdiction over a case. A trial court is divested of
subject-matter jurisdiction upon entry of a final order. Until tha t
time, the trial court retains general subject-matter jurisdiction over
the case while an interlocutory appeal is pending.” Id. at ___. An y
error by the trial court that arises during or from the interlocutory
appeal is subject to appellate review after a final order is entered. Id.
at ___. See also People v Robinson, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024).
A stay of proceedings only applies to “proceedings related to the
disputed order and not to other issues,” and “a trial court’s decision
in regard to which aspects of the case are and are not involved in the
appeal depends on the nature of the appeal.” Scott, ___ Mich at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “This decision will require
familiarity with the facts of the case and experience in maintaining a
trial court docket.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, “the trial court’s decision
on this issue is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and will not be
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-3
Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
disturbed unless that decision falls outside the range of principled
outcomes.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Scott, the defendant applied in the Michigan Supreme Court “for
leave to appeal a Court of Appeals judgment that remanded the
case to the trial court for further proceedings.” Id. at ___ (Court of
Appeals reversed the trial court’s decision that evidence of previou s
sexual assaults was inadmissible against defendant at trial). “Under
those circumstances, an automatic stay of the remand proceeding s
was in place that barred the trial court from addressing aspects of
that interlocutory appeal.” Id. at ___, citing MCR 7.305(C)(6)(a).
While the defendant’s application was pending, “the trial cour t
conducted a trial that clearly involved aspects of defendant’ s
pending interlocutory appeal.” Scott, ___ Mich at ___. “During trial,
the very evidence that was disputed in the interlocutory appeal wa s
admitted.” Id. at ___ (explaining that “the Court of Appeals ’
decision to initially grant the prosecution’s application for leave t o
appeal [was] itself a solid indicator that the disputed evidence wa s
not collateral and was indeed significant to the case”). “Admitting
into evidence at trial arguably prejudicial testimony that remained
in dispute on appeal is not only highly irregular; it was also
unreasonable and outside the range of principled outcomes.” Id. a t
___. Although “the trial court abused its discretion by holding a trial
that included this evidence under these circumstances,” the Scot t
Court held that it was “a procedural error” that could “be remedied
through subsequent appellate review after a final judgment [was]
entered.” Id. at ___.
2.2 Relevancy
A. Relevant Evidence Defined
Evidence must be relevant to be admissible. MRE 402. There are tw o
types of relevance as it relates to admissibility: logical relevance and
legal relevance. See Rock v Crocker, 499 Mich 247, 256 (2016).
Logical relevance. MRE 401 and MRE 402 contemplate logical
relevance. Rock, 499 Mich at 256. Two separate questions must b e
answered in determining whether evidence is logically relevant:
“First, [the court] must determine the materiality of th e
evidence. In other words, . . . whether the evidence wa s
of consequence to the determination of the action.
Second, [the court] must determine the probative forc e
of the evidence, or rather, whether the evidence makes a
fact of consequence more or less probable than it woul d
be without the evidence.
Page 2-4 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
. . . A fact that is of consequence to the action is a
material fact. Materiality looks to the relation betwee n
the propositions for which the evidence is offered an d
the issues in the case. If the evidence is offered to hel p
prove a proposition which is not a matter in issue, th e
evidence is immaterial.
. . . Probative force is the tendency to make the existenc e
of any fact that is of consequence to the determination o f
the action more probable or less probable than it woul d
be without the evidence. Further, any tendency i s
sufficient probative force.” People v Mills, 450 Mich 61,
67-68 (1995) (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Legal relevance. “Even if logically relevant under MRE 401 and
MRE 402, evidence may still be excluded under . . . a rule of legal
relevance, defined as a rule limiting the use of evidence that i s
2
logically relevant,” such as MRE 404. Rock, 499 Mich at 25 6
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Legal relevance, as a
limiting rule, concerns the purpose for which evidence is used.” Id.
See Section 2.2(D) for examples of relevant and irrelevant evidence.
B. Relevant Evidence Admissible
Relevant evidence is generally admissible. MRE 402. The Michiga n
Supreme Court has addressed the issue of admissibility as follows:
“The test of relevancy is designed to determine whethe r
a single piece of evidence is of such significant impor t
that it warrants being considered in a case. Th e
standards for admissibility are designed to permit th e
introduction of all relevant evidence, not otherwis e
excluded, on the theory that it is best to have as muc h
useful information as possible in making these types o f
decisions[.]” People v Hampton, 407 Mich 354, 367 (1979).
C. Relevant Evidence Excluded (Balancing Test)
“The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value i s
substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the
following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the
jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting
cumulative evidence.” MRE 403. For example, subject to an y
exceptions listed in the specific rule, MRE 404 and MRE 407–MRE
411 exclude from admission certain categories of evidence that may
be otherwise relevant to the case. These include character evidence,
2 See Section 2.3 for more information on MRE 404.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-5
Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
subsequent remedial measures, settlement negotiations, offers t o
pay medical expenses, plea discussions, and insurance coverage.
Although these matters may be relevant, they are generally
excluded by MRE 403 because they tend to be more prejudicial tha n
probative as a matter of law. These specific rules of evidence are
discussed throughout this chapter.
“Rule 403 determinations are best left to a contemporaneou s
assessment of the presentation, credibility, and effect of
testimony[.]” People v VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52, 81 (1993). “Assessing
probative value against prejudicial effect requires a balancing of
several factors, including the time required to present the evidence
and the possibility of delay, whether the evidence is needlessly
cumulative, how directly the evidence tends to prove the fact for
which it is offered, how essential the fact sought to be proved is t o
the case, the potential for confusing or misleading the jury, and
whether the fact can be proved in another manner without as many
harmful collateral effects.” People v Blackston, 481 Mich 451, 462
(2008).
The Michigan Court of Appeals addressed the issue of “unfair
prejudice”:
“‘Unfair prejudice’ does not mean ‘damaging.’ Bradbur y
v Ford Motor Co, 123 Mich App 179, 185 (1983). An y
relevant testimony will be damaging to some extent. W e
believe that the notion of ‘unfair prejudice’ encompasse s
two concepts. First, the idea of prejudice denotes a
situation in which there exists a danger that marginall y
probative evidence will be given undue or pre-emptiv e
weight by the jury. In other words, where a probabilit y
exists that evidence which is minimally damaging i n
logic will be weighed by the jurors substantially out o f
proportion to its logically damaging effect, a situatio n
arises in which the danger of ‘prejudice’ exists. Second,
the idea of unfairness embodies the further propositio n
that it would be inequitable to allow the proponent o f
the evidence to use it. Where a substantial danger o f
prejudice exists from the admission of particula r
evidence, unfairness will usually, but not invariably,
exist. Unfairness might not exist where, for instance, th e
critical evidence supporting a party’s position on a ke y
issue raises the danger of prejudice within the meanin g
of MRE 403 as we have defined this term but th e
proponent of this evidence has no less prejudicial mean s
by which the substance of this evidence can b e
admitted.” Sclafani v Peter S Cusimano Inc, 130 Mich App
728, 735-736 (1983).
Page 2-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
“All evidence offered by the parties is ‘prejudicial’ to some extent,
but the fear of prejudice does not generally render the evidence
inadmissible. It is only when the probative value is substantiall y
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice that evidence i s
excluded.” People v Mills, 450 Mich 61, 75 (1995).
D. Caselaw
1. Evidence Relevant
Evidence of a witness’s agreement for testimony.
“Agreements for testimony are relevant to assessing a witness’ s
credibility.” People v Bryson, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “The
jury’s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a give n
witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and i t
is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of th e
witness in testifying falsely that a defendant’s life or libert y
may depend.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). In Bryson, “the prosecution failed to disclose the full
terms of an accomplice witness’s agreement fo r
testimony . . . .” Id. at ___. The accomplice “testified that h e
agreed to cooperate and testify for the prosecution in exchang e
for pleading guilty to a lesser charge.” Id. at ___. “While no t
paid monetarily for his cooperation, [the accomplice] wa s
nonetheless rewarded with the opportunity to plead guilty to a
lesser charge.” Id. at ___. “And in reality, he was rewarded wit h
a complete dismissal of all charges.” Id. at ___. “It was essentia l
to the jury’s determination of [the accomplice’s] credibility t o
know the facts surrounding his agreement to testify.” Id. at ___.
“After hearing that [the accomplice] had already pleade d
guilty and served a sentence for his involvement in the hom e
invasion, the jury may have believed that [the accomplice] di d
not have a motive to fabricate his testimony because he had
already served his sentence.” Id. at ___. “The jury may have
given [the accomplice] undue credibility based on th e
uncorrected false testimony.” Id. at ___. “Because the fals e
testimony concerned [the accomplice’s] agreement to testify,
the prosecutor had an affirmative duty to specifically correc t
his testimony regarding that agreement.” Id. at ___.
Evidence of a hospitalization resulting from defendant’ s
alleged physical discipline less than one year before th e
injuries giving rise to the charges against defendant.
Evidence of the victim’s prior hospitalization 11 months befor e
defendant’s charged conduct was admissible to prove that th e
victim’s prior medical emergency resulted from defendant’ s
prior abuse. People v Jones, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). In
Jones, two witnesses testified “about an incident in June 2016
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-7
Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
when defendant called an ambulance because he found [th e
victim] unresponsive when she was in his care.” Id. at ___.
“The [trial] court made findings that correspond to the firs t
(similarity), second (temporal proximity), and sixth (lack o f
other available evidence) factors of the . . . analysis [in People v
Watkins (Watkins II), 491 Mich 450, 470 (2012)].” Id. at ___. “The
trial court found that the proffered evidence was relevant t o
showing a pattern of behavior on defendant’s part, namel y
because the evidence demonstrated that defendant physicall y
disciplined the children, and that on more than one occasio n
[the victim], the younger and smaller child, sustained a bruis e
after an event of physical discipline.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks omitted). While defendant’s “charges reflect[ed] a muc h
more serious beating that resulted in [the victim’s] death, [th e
trial court] concluded that there [were] sufficient similaritie s
such that the . . . charged conduct demonstrates an aggravatio n
of the other alleged acts of domestic violence.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks omitted). The Jones Court concluded tha t
“the incidents also were similar in that they both occurre d
while defendant was alone and ‘in charge’ of the children.” Id.
at ___. “Additionally, defendant’s and [the victim’s mother’s ]
attempt to explain the 2016 incident is another factor weighin g
in favor of admission.” Id. at ___ (“This consideration does no t
clearly come within any of the factors enumerated in Watkins,
but the list is not exhaustive.”). “Defendant and [the victim’ s
mother] told medical staff that [the victim] fainted because sh e
was dehydrated and suffering from heat stroke, but thi s
explanation was not corroborated.” Id. at ___. “A reasonable
inference is that defendant and [the victim’s mother] fabricate d
an explanation to conceal abuse.” Id. at ___. “Regarding the
fifth Watkins factor (lack of reliability), defendant argue[d] tha t
evidence relating to the 2016 hospitalization was unreliabl e
because the related Children’s Protective Services (CPS )
investigation found no evidence of abuse.” Id. at ___.
“However, the CPS report recording the investigators ’
findings” was inadmissible hearsay, and “defendant stipulate d
that CPS reports and investigations would not be admitted. ”
Id. at ___. (“In any event, the outcome of the 2016 CP S
investigation [was] not definitive proof of defendant’ s
innocence.”). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion when it admitted evidence of the victim’s prio r
hospitalization.
Evidence of defendant’s use of physical discipline. Becaus e
evidence of prior corporal punishment (physical discipline )
was relevant to whether the defendant physically punished th e
victim on the day she died, the trial court did not abuse “it s
discretion in weighing the [Watkins] similarity factor in the
Page 2-8 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
prosecution’s favor.” Jones, ___ Mich App at ___. In Jones, the
victim’s brother testified at trial “that defendant gave [the four-
year-old victim] a ‘whooping’ before she lost consciousness. ”
Id. at ___. “He stated that by ‘whooping’ he meant that [the
victim] was ‘getting hit on the butt’ with defendant’s hand.” Id.
at ___. “Defendant sometimes gave [the victim’s brother ]
‘whoopings’ when he got into trouble for fighting at school,
including an incident when he was expelled from school.” Id.
at ___. “This evidence of defendant’s propensity to us e
physical punishments was probative of whether he physicall y
punished [the victim] on [the day before she died].” Id. at ___.
“Evidence that the previous punishments involved beatings b y
hand and beatings with a belt was probative of defendant’ s
propensity to escalate the violence of the punishments.” Id. a t
___. The victim’s brother’s “testimony established an overal l
pattern of defendant’s willingness to inflict physical
punishments against very young children.” Id. at ___. Wit h
regard to the third Watkins factor, frequency, the victim’ s
brother’s “testimony recall[ed] multiple punishments fo r
fighting in school and at home.” Id. at ___. “Whether thes e
incidents were ‘frequent’ is a subjective evaluation, but on e
that the trial court could reasonably make in favor o f
admission.” Id. at ___.
Evidence of the complaining witness’s unrelated death. “Th e
explanation for why a witness is unavailable to testify may b e
probative of the witness’s credibility.” People v Horton, 341 Mic h
App 397, 405 (2022). “[T]he knowledge that the complainin g
witness did not appear because she [was] dead would assis t
the jury in assessing her credibility.” Id. at 406. “If the jury wer e
aware that the complaining witness died in an unrelate d
accident, then it would know that her absence was caused b y
circumstances that have no bearing on her credibility, and thi s
would negate the risk that the jury might erroneously allo w
her absence to impact its assessment of her credibility.” Id. a t
406. The Court also held that “an explanation as to why th e
complaining witness [was] unavailable to testify [was] als o
relevant because Snapchat videos in which defendan t
threatened to kill the witness [were] deemed by the trial cour t
to be admissible evidence at trial” and her “unexplained
absence” “at the trial could [have] wrongly lead the jury t o
infer that her absence [was] attributable to defendant, i.e., tha t
he killed her.” Id. at 406-407.
Evidence addressed material issue of self defense. Evidence
that the victims’ boyfriend told her to “shoot, shoot,” wa s
“relevant because it addressed a material issue–the issue o f
self-defense.” People v Rajput, 505 Mich 7, 14 (2020). The Cour t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-9
Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
of Appeals “made an improper factual finding that defendan t
and [another individual] were initial aggressors and could
have fled,” and “it also erred by finding [the] testimon y
irrelevant for this reason.” Id. “Regardless of the merits of thi s
defense, whether defendant and [the other individual] wer e
the initial aggressors or could have fled were issues for the jur y
to decide because defendant presented sufficient evidence t o
satisfy his burden of proof on self-defense.” Id. at 12 (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted).
Evidence regarding threat made by victim central t o
defendant’s self-defense theory. Defendant’s testimony tha t
her then-boyfriend threatened to kill her—improperl y
excluded as hearsay—was central to her self-defense theory.
People v Nelson, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025). “Without the trial
court’s error, defendant’s testimony would have consisted o f
[his] threat to kill her, along with two incidents of [him ]
engaging in violence against her.” Id. at ___. “A jury could hav e
viewed defendant’s decision to retrieve the firearm in th e
context that defendant believed that [he] would continue t o
escalate the situation and that harm to her was both plausibl e
and imminent.” Id. at ___. “Without the threat being conveyed
to the jury, the jury only knew that defendant had bee n
attacked by [him] but that the attacks had ended by the tim e
defendant retrieved the firearm.” Id. at ___. “The jury would
not have known that defendant’s act was in response t o
someone who had, in a short time span, both attacked he r
twice and expressly told her that he would end her life.” Id. a t
___. “Without defendant’s testimony, the evidence presented a t
trial was inadequate to demonstrate to the jury that defendan t
was confronted with a deadly threat that would justify he r
possession of the firearm.” Id. at ___. “[W]hen a jury i s
presented with competing narratives, an erroneou s
deprivation of a defendant’s opportunity to present and
support a central facet of the defense theory distorts a
defendant’s credibility.” Id. at ___ (recognizing that “the jur y
was presented with a credibility contest”). “The trial court, i n
erroneously excluding defendant’s testimony concerning [the ]
threat, both deprived defendant of the opportunity to presen t
evidence that bolstered her defense and facilitated a pathwa y
for the prosecution to argue that her defense was meritless.” Id.
at ___ (“In a case where the jury was considering whom t o
believe, . . . these errors were more probably than not outcome-
determinative.”).
Evidence was probative of who impregnated complainant.
Evidence of the complainant’s pregnancy and abortion wa s
relevant during defendant’s criminal sexual conduct trial
Page 2-10 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
because the evidence made it more probable that sexual
penetration had occurred. People v Sharpe, 502 Mich 313, 332-
333 (2018). Evidence of the complainant’s lack of sexua l
partners was also relevant because it was probative of th e
3
identity of the person who impregnated the complainant. Id.
(further holding that the probative value of this evidence wa s
not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfai r
prejudice).
Evidence of pregnancy. Photographs showing a dead fetu s
were “highly relevant” to the elements of assaulting a pregnan t
woman causing stillbirth or miscarriage, MCL 750.90a(b), and
“the prosecution was entitled to offer all relevant evidenc e
establishing that [the victim] was pregnant and tha t
defendant’s actions resulted in the death of [the victim’s ]
fetus.” People v Boshell, 337 Mich App 322, 331 (2021).
Evidence regarding forensic interviewing protocol or
investigative procedure. “Frequently, the process and protocol
by which a complainant was interviewed will be directl y
relevant to an issue in dispute.” People v Butsinas, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2025). “[A] common defense strategy in cases o f
child-sexual abuse lies in criticizing the investigation of th e
complainant’s allegations.” Id. at ___. “In such a case,
testimony regarding the protocol of forensic interviewing o r
the investigation would be directly relevant to rebut tha t
defense strategy.” Id. at ___ (concluding that testimon y
“explaining [the] investigative process was relevant for th e
jury to assess the sufficiency of [the] investigation and t o
contextualize [the victim’s] allegations in light of tha t
investigation” in order “to rebut the defense theory . . . tha t
[the] investigation was faulty or illegal”). The Butsinas Cour t
“disagree[d] with the position that evidence regarding th e
protocol of forensic interviewing . . . or investigative
procedure . . . should be categorically inadmissible.” Id. at __ _
(“hold[ing] the relevance of this testimony should continue t o
be examined on a case-by-case basis”).
Evidence of text messages. Text messages between th e
defendant and the victim were “highly relevant to show th e
past relationship between the defendant and the victim” i n
defendant’s “first-degree, premeditated murder case[.] ”
Boshell, 337 Mich App at 333 (2021).
Evidence of motive. “In a murder case, proof of motive i s
always relevant, even if not always necessary.” People v Smith,
3See Section 2.3(D) for discussion of admissibility under MCL 750.520j.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-11
Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
336 Mich App 79, 113 (2021) (concluding that although “gang-
related evidence cannot be admitted to show that a perso n
acted in conformance with gang membership,” such evidenc e
4
can “be admissible if it is used for a nonconformity purpose”).
Evidence of consciousness of guilt. “It is well-established tha t
evidence demonstrating a defendant’s consciousness of guilt i s
relevant.” People v Wade, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “A jur y
may infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that a
defendant was attempting to evade responsibility, such a s
evidence that defendant was lying or being deceptive, tha t
defendant fled the scene of the crime, or that the defendan t
destroyed or hid evidence or sought to conceal thei r
involvement in a crime . . . [.]” Id. at ___ (citations omitted). I n
Wade, defendant’s former-girlfriend “testified that defendan t
became concerned with the mere prospect of a polygrap h
examination after [the victim’s] murder, from which a jury
could infer defendant’s consciousness of guilt.” Id. at ___
(holding that “defendant’s desire to learn ‘how to pass a
polygraph’ was not the kind of polygraph-related evidenc e
that the jury would use improperly, it was relevant t o
defendant’s consciousness of guilt, and it was merely one o f
several pieces of evidence suggesting that defendant wished t o
conceal the extent of his involvement in [the victim’s] death”).
Evidence that defendant presented a badge and inquired of a
police officer who was conducting a drunk drivin g
investigation whether “anything could be done” was “relevan t
to proving his consciousness of guilt.” People v Parrott, 33 5
Mich App 648, 680 (2021). “[A] jury could infer fro m
defendant’s conduct that defendant knew he was unlawfull y
operating a vehicle while under the influence. Defendant’ s
conduct and statements could also support an argument tha t
he was attempting to curry favor with law enforcement an d
influence the investigation’s outcome to avoid arrest.” Id.
“Evidence that a defendant made efforts to influence a n
adverse witness is relevant if it shows consciousness of guilt. ”
Butsinas, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “Evidence that defendant attempted to mak e
witnesses change their testimony through bribing an d
intimidation was highly probative of a consciousness of guilt. ”
Id. at ___ (“Evidence contextualizing the investigation of [th e
victim’s] disclosure and defendant’s conduct in the aftermat h
of [the victim’s] disclosure was highly probative of defendant’ s
guilt.”).
4See Section 4.5 for more information on gang-related evidence.
Page 2-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
Evidence of other murders relevant to charge of conspiracy.
Evidence of other murders “was relevant to the charge o f
conspiracy in [defendant’s] case” where “[t]he prosecutor’ s
theory of the case was that [defendant] conspired with [his co-
defendant] and others to perform hits on behalf of” othe r
individuals. People v Caddell, 332 Mich App 27, 69, 70 (2020).
Although defendant was not charged with the additiona l
murders, “he was charged with conspiracy to commit murder,
which included a conspiracy related to the [other] murders[.] ”
Id. (“although he was incarcerated at the time of the murders,
the jury could still conclude that [defendant] conspired and
planned the murders from within jail”).
Lack of financial motive. Where “financial motive may be
relevant evidence of [the charged crime], it logically follow s
that a lack of financial motive is also relevant to whether a
defendant committed [the charged crime].” People v Burger, 331
Mich App 504, 515 (2020) (the trial court erred in excludin g
testimony from defendant’s landlord in his arson trial wher e
the “testimony was offered to show that defendant was curren t
on his rent and to thus further his theory that he had n o
financial motive to commit an arson”) (citation omitted).
Evidence made a fact of consequence more probable tha n
without it. Defendant’s statement “that he sexually abused hi s
relatives while he was a juvenile,” which was contained in a n
affidavit that was prepared in support of a previous motion t o
withdraw his plea, was relevant evidence in his criminal sexual
conduct trial “because it [had] a tendency to make a fact o f
consequence–[defendant’s] guilt and the children’s credibility–
more probable than it would be without the evidence.” People v
Cowhy, 330 Mich App 452, 467 (2019) (the court furthe r
determined that the affidavit was not otherwise inadmissibl e
5
under MRE 410 ).
Evidence reflected defendant’s emotional state. The victim’ s
testimony that the defendant “said Islamic prayers an d
‘Muslim things’ in Arabic,” and that the victim “‘hated the fac t
that [defendant] felt he was a bad person’ and ‘the fact tha t
[Muslims had] made him [that] way,” and that he “had becom e
more emotional and upset as they spoke about persona l
matters” “was relevant to demonstrate [the defendant’s] stat e
of mind as observed by [the victim] during the time that h e
unlawfully confined her.” People v Urban, 321 Mich App 198,
209-210 (2017) (second alteration in original), vacated in par t
6
on other grounds 504 Mich 950 (2019). “The prosecution’ s

Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
theory of the case was that defendant committed the crime s
because he had become upset at recent losses in his life, and
[the victim’s] testimony reflected defendant’s emotional
turmoil.” Urban, 321 Mich App at 210 (further holding that the
testimony was not unfairly prejudicial because “evidence tha t
defendant engaged in prayer and religious practices and wa s
severely emotionally distressed during the commission of th e
crime was unlikely to inflame the jury to the extent that i t
could not evaluate the case based on the evidence presented”).
Evidence about the state of the defendant’s home – that it was a
mess, smelled bad, had broken doors, holes in some walls, and
had things painted on the walls—“was . . . relevant to the
prosecution’s theory that defendant’s deteriorating emotiona l
state, as evidenced by the neglect and defacement of his home,
contributed to his commission of the charged crimes.” Urban,
321 Mich App at 213-214.
Evidence regarding concurrent proceeding was inextricabl y
linked to current case. Evidence from a concurrent proceedin g
in the probate court involving matters related to trust asset s
was properly admitted during the proceeding regarding th e
estate where the evidence from the trust matter wa s
“inextricably linked” to the handling of the estate; specifically,
the probate court properly admitted a letter ordering th e
payment of expenses from the trust where “the record
demonstrated that income from the Rhea Trust flows directl y
to [the] personal estate.” In re Brody Conservatorship, 321 Mich
App 332, 349 (2017).
Evidence affected who jury believed and reflecte d
defendant’s state of mind. During the defendant’s murder
trial, where the defendant claimed she killed her boyfriend i n
self-defense, testimony from the victim’s biological daughte r
that the defendant attempted to prevent the victim’s biologica l
daughter from having custody of her half sister the day afte r
the victim’s death was relevant because it provided a
“conflicting portrayal of defendant after the victim’s death, ”
and “had a tendency to affect whether the jury believe d
defendant’s daughters’ testimony and reflected defendant’ s
state of mind shortly after the victim was killed[.]” People v
Dixon-Bey, 321 Mich App 490, 513-515 (2017) (the testimony
was not unfairly prejudicial because it was “a brief portion o f
one witness’s testimony during six days of testimony over a n
eight-day trial,” there was no evidence to support it portrayed
the defendant “as an evil person” as she claimed, and “an y

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
prejudicial effect from the fact that the jury might have viewe d
defendant negatively because of how she handled” th e
custody dispute was “minimal at best when compared to th e
probative value that this testimony had on several witnesses ’
biases and defendant’s mindset shortly after the victim wa s
killed”; the defendant did not make any argument regardin g
whether the testimony constituted improper characte r
evidence under MRE 404).
Evidence showed defendant was in close proximity to crime.
Testimony that an individual matching the defendant’ s
description was at a gas station 25 minutes before an armed
robbery occurred at a Halo Burger located seven miles awa y
from the gas station was relevant evidence during th e
defendant’s trial for the Halo burger armed robbery. People v
Henry, 315 Mich App 130, 145-146 (2016). Testimony
established that the witness cooperated in finding an image o f
the individual matching the defendant’s description on the ga s
station surveillance video, and this image was later shown t o
two Halo Burger employees, who identified the robber as th e
person depicted in the surveillance video image. Id. at 146. The
Court of Appeals held that “the evidence was highly relevant ”
because it “placed defendant in the vicinity of the Halo Burge r
at the time of the robbery,” and the defendant’s presence at th e
gas station “resulted in surveillance images that allowed th e
Halo Burger victims . . . to identify the robber.” Id. (notin g
further that the probative value of the evidence was no t
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice).
Committee Tip:
When making a determination or inquiring of
counsel whether evidence is relevant, consider
“then what.” For example, is the evidence
otherwise excluded by another rule of evidence
such as hearsay?
2. Evidence Irrelevant
Evidence of dismissal of a civil action not relevant in
criminal trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion i n
excluding evidence of the dismissal of a civil lawsuit i n
defendants’ criminal trial where they were charged with th e
general intent crime of conducting an unlicensed gamblin g
7
operation. People v Zitka, 335 Mich App 324, 335-336 (2021)
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-15
Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(“[d]efendants maintain[ed] that this evidence was relevant t o
show that they believed they were operating their business i n
compliance with the law”). “[W]hile evidence concernin g
whether defendants’ operation met the statutory requirement s
for a gambling operation involving ‘gambling games’ wa s
relevant, evidence whether defendants specifically intended
their operation to be an unlicensed gambling operation o r
specifically intended to violate MCL 432.218(1)(a) was no t
relevant.” Zitka, 335 Mich App at 338. Defendants were als o
charged with the specific intent crime of unlawful use of a
8
computer to commit a crime. “The specific intent necessary t o
commit this offense is the intent to use a computer to conduct a
gambling operation without a license”; “the prosecution wa s
not required to prove that defendants used the computer wit h
the specific intent or knowledge that the gambling operatio n
they were conducting was illegal.” Id. at 340. “This woul d
effectively convert the underlying offense into a specific-inten t
crime”; thus, “the settlement in [the] civil lawsuit would be n o
more relevant to determining defendants’ guilt or innocenc e
for the crime of unlawful use of a computer than for th e
underlying crime of conducting the gambling operation.” Id.
Evidence did not have tendency to make consequential fac t
more or less probable than without it. “In the absence of
evidence connecting [a] fracture to defendant,” exper t
testimony that the victim may have suffered a fracture prior t o
the events at issue in defendant’s trial for first-degree child
abuse was irrelevant because “it did not have any tendency t o
make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to th e
determination of the action more probable or less probabl e
9
than it would be without the evidence.” People v McFarlane,
325 Mich App 507, 530 (2018) (quotation marks omitted).
Evidence did not relate to crime. The trial court erred b y
permitting testimony from a witness who was in a romanti c
relationship with the defendant that the defendant’s mothe r
asked her to lie while testifying about whether the witnes s
gave the defendant permission to use her car on the day he wa s
arrested. People v Henry, 315 Mich App 130, 146-147 (2016). Th e
evidence was irrelevant, and thus inadmissible, because th e
defendant “was not on trial for stealing the vehicle o r
unlawfully driving it away,” and it was not disputed that h e
was arrested in the car. Id. at 147. Moreover, the Court rejected

8A violation of MCL 752.796 and MCL 752.797(3)(e).
9See Section 4.3(C) for additional information on physically abused child syndrome.
Page 2-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
the prosecution’s argument that the evidence was relevant t o
the witness’s credibility because it showed her “motivation no t
to lie.” Id. The Court acknowledged that if “a witness i s
offering relevant testimony, whether that witness is truthfull y
and accurately testifying is itself relevant because it affects th e
probability of the existence of a consequential fact,” bu t
concluded that it was “unclear how the [testimony in this case ]
touched on anything other than defendant’s mother’s potential
wrongdoing.” Id. at 147-148 (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
3. Balancing Probative Value and Unfair Prejudice
Defendant’s former girlfriend’s testimony “that defendan t
became concerned with the mere prospect of a polygrap h
examination after [the victim’s] murder [was relevan t
evidence], from which a jury could infer defendant’ s
consciousness of guilt.” People v Wade, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025). “It is true that this evidence could have an innocuou s
explanation, but it could also be consistent with a fear of bein g
investigated for [the victim’s] murder.” Id. at ___. “Wha t
significance to give to [the] disputed testimony, if any, was fo r
the jury to decide.” Id. at ___. “And when the jury did so, i t
would not have the type of polygraph-related evidence befor e
it that raises concerns—nothing that the jury heard suggeste d
that defendant took a polygraph, was asked to take a
polygraph, or was willing or unwilling to take a polygraph. ”
Id. at ___. “It follows that there was no danger that the jury
would draw the improper credibility inferences from [the ]
disputed testimony that the prohibition against polygrap h
evidence is intended to curb.” Id. at ___. “The evidence was, of
course, prejudicial to defendant in the way that all evidenc e
tending to establish a defendant’s guilt is prejudicial.” Id. at __ _
n 7. “But it was not unfairly prejudicial because it did not injec t
considerations extraneous to the merits of the case.” Id. “And
considering the relevance of the evidence, the evidence’ s
probative value was certainly not substantially outweighed b y
the danger of unfair prejudice as required to preclude th e
evidence under MRE 403.” Wade, ___ Mich App at ___ n 7.
Evidence of a complaining witness’s death in a car acciden t
may be probative of the witness’s credibility to explain wh y
she was unavailable to testify. People v Horton, 341 Mich Ap p
397, 405-407 (2022). In Horton, the Court rejected th e
defendant’s argument that evidence of the complainin g
witness’s death should be excluded under MRE 403, stating
that “the fact that her death was caused by a car accident does
not have [any] tendency to unfairly bolster her credibility o r
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-17
Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
generate any anger toward defendant,” and noting that
“evidence that the complaining witness’s death was not caused
by defendant would eliminate the risk that the jury could infe r
that defendant played a role in her death, in light of th e
evidence that defendant threatened to kill her in Snapcha t
videos.” Id. at 409. The Court was “unconvinced that the jury’ s
sympathy would motivate it to find defendant guilty” becaus e
“the witness’s death was wholly unconnected to the merits o f
[the] case.” Id. at 409. Although the Court conceded tha t
“experience and intuition suggest” the defendant’s concern s
that “the complaining witness’s credibility would be unfairl y
bolstered because people ‘valorize’ the dead,” it conclude d
that the “trial court was presented with a close call, and th e
trial court’s decision on a close call cannot be an abuse of
discretion.” Id. at 409, 410.
The Court also rejected the defendant’s argument that vide o
from the preliminary examination of the complaining witness’ s
testimony should have been excluded under MRE 403 becaus e
it briefly showed the defendant wearing jail garb. Horton, 341
Mich App at 402, 403. In “undertaking the balancing tes t
articulated in MRE 403,” the Horton Court “assess[ed] th e
value gained from seeing the complaining witness rather tha n
just hearing her, and weigh[ed] this against the risk of unfai r
prejudice stemming from defendant’s clothing.” Id. at 404. Th e
Court found that “[t]he probative value added by playing th e
video of the testimony instead of playing the audio or readin g
the transcripts [was] substantial.” Id. at 404. “Seeing the
witness is an important component of assessing the witness’ s
credibility because it enables jurors to observe factors such as
demeanor and body language, and the jurors can obtain a
better understanding of the witness’s mood and nonverbal
cues. Anything that can assist the jury in assessing the
credibility of the complaining witness in a credibility contes t
has significant probative value.” Id. at 405. The Horton Cour t
held that the “risk of unfair prejudice posed by the video ,
however, [was] less significant” because “defendant [was]
dressed in civilian clothes” “[f]or the entirety of the trial.” Id. a t
405.
“The mere fact that [a black-and-white photograph displayed ]
a fetus [was] not unfairly prejudicial to defendan t
because . . . that [was] what [made] the photo relevant and
probative” in defendant’s trial for assault causing stillbirth o r
miscarriage. People v Boshell, 337 Mich App 322, 332 (2021). The
Court noted that “[w]hile a fetus [was] identifiable, the black-
and-white photo lack[ed] any ‘gruesomeness’ factor,” and
“[t]he copy of the photo that defense counsel
Page 2-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.2
provided . . . look[ed] more like an illustration from a textbook
or dictionary, or a copy of an ultrasound photo.” Id
(concluding that introduction of the photo did not inject “an y
risk of unfair prejudice” where it lacked color, and thus lacked
details “such as blood or other ‘wetness’”).
The trial court did not reach “an unprincipled decision i n
determining that any unfair prejudice did not substantially
outweigh the probative value” of texts between the defendan t
and victim that “contained many crude sexual term s
and . . . exhibited a lack of respect toward” the victim because
the texts were “highly relevant to show the past relationshi p
between the defendant and the victim.” Boshell, 337 Mich App
at 333-334 (“while there arguably was some potential for unfai r
prejudice that could have been injected into the proceeding s
through these text messages, it did not substantially outweig h
the messages’ probative value”).
Where four Facebook posts constituting gang-related evidenc e
were relevant to establish motive and absence of mistake, thei r
admission did not violate MRE 403 because the posts “were
not particularly shocking or gratuitous” and while one pos t
contained “some vile homophobic slurs,” the slurs were no t
gang-related and were made by a rival gang member not th e
10
defendant. People v Smith, 336 Mich App 79, 114 (2021).
Evidence that defendant presented a badge and inquired of a
police officer who was conducting a drunk drivin g
investigation whether “anything could be done” wa s
“admissible under MRE 403.” People v Parrott, 335 Mich Ap p
648, 680-681 (2021). “Although this evidence could potentially
prejudice defendant, . . . the probative value of defendant’ s
alleged statement and display of his badge [was] no t
substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice because it [was ]
highly probative in that it reflect[ed] his consciousness o f
guilt.” Id. at 681-682.
Evidence contained in an affidavit, drafted by defendant i n
support of a previous motion to withdraw his plea, “that h e
sexually abused his relatives while he was a juvenile, . . . whil e
damaging to [defendant’s] case, [was] not unfairly prejudicial ”
because “it [bore] directly on his guilt and on the credibility o f
the [victims].” People v Cowhy, 330 Mich App 452, 467, 46 8
(2019) (the court further determined that the affidavit was no t
11
otherwise inadmissible under MRE 410 ).

Section 2.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“[T]he risk of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweig h
the probative force of the evidence” where the trial cour t
admitted evidence of the defendant’s participation in “ a
serious and entirely separate crime.” People v Murphy (O n
Remand), 282 Mich App 571, 583 (2009). In Murphy, th e
defendant robbed the victim at gunpoint while stopped at a
traffic light. Id. at 573-574. The trial court properly admitted
evidence that arose from the defendant’s subsequen t
participation in a separate carjacking. Id. at 574-575. Th e
carjacking evidence did not violate MRE 403 because (1) i t
connected the defendant to the vehicle and weapon used to ro b
the victim in the instant case, (2) the prosecutor never argued
to the jury that the defendant’s participation in the subsequen t
carjacking established his guilt in the armed robbery, and (3 )
the judge issued a cautionary instruction to the jury limitin g
the potential of undue prejudice. Murphy (On Remand), 282
Mich App at 583. Upon request, the court “may provide a
limiting instruction under MRE 105.” People v Knox, 469 Mich
502, 509 (2004); see also People v VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52, 75
(1993). “If the court admits evidence that is admissible agains t
a party or for a purpose — but not against another party or for
another purpose — the court, on timely request, must restric t
the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jur y
accordingly.” MRE 105.
E. Interrogation Statements
“[I]f an interrogator’s out-of-court statement is offered to provide
context to a defendant’s statement that is not ‘in issue,’ it follow s
that both the interrogator’s and the defendant’s statements are
immaterial and, thus, not relevant.” People v Musser, 494 Mich 337 ,
355 (2013). See also People v Tomasik, 498 Mich 953, 953 (2015)
(holding that the trial court erred in “admitting the recording of the
defendants interrogation” because “nothing of any relevance wa s
said during the interrogation . . . and thus was not admissibl e
evidence”). “Likewise, the interrogator’s out-of-court statements or
questions have no probative value if those statements or questions,
when considered in relationship to a defendant’s statements, do no t
actually provide context to the defendant’s statements. Musser, 494
Mich at 355-356. “Accordingly, an interrogator’s out-of-cour t
statements must be redacted if that can be done without harming
the probative value of a defendant’s statements.” Id. at 356.
However, just because an interrogator’s statement “has some
relevance to its proffered purpose does not necessarily mean tha t
the statement may be presented to the jury”; it must satisfy the
balancing test under MRE 403. Musser, 494 Mich at 356-357. That is ,
“a trial court must . . . evaluate the probative value of the out-of-
Page 2-20 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
court statements in providing context to a defendant’s statement s
and the resulting prejudice to a defendant before the interrogator’ s
out-of-court statements are presented to the jury.” Id. Whe n
employing this test, the court “should be particularly mindful tha t
when a statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter
asserted and would otherwise be inadmissible if a witness testified
to the same at trial, there is a ‘danger that the jury might have
difficulty limiting its consideration of the material to [its] proper
purpose[.]’” Id. at 357, quoting Stachowiak v Subczynski, 411 Mich
459, 465 (1981) (first alteration in original).
In addition, an investigating officer’s statement “‘may be give n
undue weight by the jury’ where the determination of a defendant’ s
guilt or innocence hinges on who the jury determines is more
credible–the complainant or the defendant,” and “courts must be
mindful of the problems inherent in presenting the statements to the
jury[.]” Musser, 494 Mich at 358. “In a trial in which the evidenc e
essentially presents a ‘one-on-one’ credibility contest between the
complainant and the defendant, the prosecutor cannot improperly
introduce statements from the investigating detective that vouch for
the veracity of the complainant and indicate that the detective
believes the defendant to be guilty.” Tomasik, 498 Mich at 953.
Finally, even if the statement is relevant for purposes of providing
context for a defendant’s statements, the statement(s) must be
restricted to their proper scope–providing context to the defendant’ s
statement. Musser, 494 Mich at 358.
Committee Tip:
An objection may appear to involve hearsay, but
can end up being about relevance, as
demonstrated in Musser, 494 Mich at 350-363.
2.3 Character Evidence
A. Character Evidence Generally Not Admissible to Prove
Conduct
Generally, evidence of a person’s character or a character trait, and
evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove
that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with th e
character or character trait. MRE 404(a); MRE 404(b). MRE 404 is a
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-21
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
rule of legal relevance, which limits the use character evidence tha t
is logically relevant under MRE 401 and MRE 402. Rock v Crocker,
499 Mich 247, 256 (2016). “Such evidence is strictly limited because
of its highly prejudicial nature; there is a significant danger that the
jury will overestimate the probative value of the character
evidence.” People v Roper, 286 Mich App 77, 91 (2009). MRE 404
applies to both criminal and civil cases. Rock, 499 Mich at 256 n 5.
1. Exceptions
MRE 404(a)(2) contains exceptions for a defendant or victim i n
a criminal case:
“(A) a defendant may offer evidence of the
defendant's pertinent trait, and if the evidence i s
admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence t o
rebut it;
(B) in a homicide case, when self-defense is a n
issue, the defendant may offer evidence of the
alleged victim's trait for aggression, and if the
evidence is admitted, the prosecution may:
(i) offer evidence of the defendant’s sam e
trait, and
(ii) offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trai t
for peacefulness to rebut evidence that th e
alleged victim was the first aggressor; and
(C) in a criminal-sexual-conduct case, the
defendant may offer evidence of:
(i) the alleged victim’s past sexual conduc t
with the defendant, and
(ii) specific instances of sexual activit y
showing the source or origin of semen,
pregnancy, or disease.” MRE 404(a)(2).
MRE 404(a)(3) contains exceptions for a witness:
“Evidence of a witness’s character may b e
admitted under [MRE 607], [MRE 608], and [MRE
12
609].” MRE 404(a)(3).
12See Section 3.9 for information on MRE 608 and MRE 609.
Page 2-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
13
When relevant to an issue in the case, MRE 404(b)(2) sets out
an exception where evidence of any other crime, wrong, or ac t
may be admitted for purposes other than to prove propensity
to commit the crime charged, irrespective of whether the othe r
incident occurred prior to, contemporaneous with, o r
subsequent to the conduct at issue in the case. See also People v
14
VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52, 74 (1993). Those purposes include
proving:
• Motive,
• Opportunity,
• Intent,
• Preparation,
• Scheme, plan, or system in doing an act,
• Knowledge,
• Identity,
• Absence of mistake, or
• Lack of accident. MRE 404(b)(2).
Note that “under MRE 404(b), the other acts may be uncharged
conduct and even conduct for which a defendant wa s
acquitted.” People v Kelly, 317 Mich App 637, 646 n 3 (2016).
Statutes that permit the use of specific past acts of the accused
in specified classes of criminal cases to prove conduct on th e
date charged include:
• Prior listed offenses committed against a minor.
15
MCL 768.27a(1).
• Prior domestic violence offenses, sexual assault,
or any violation listed in MCL 750.448 to MCL
750.462h (offenses involving commercial sexua l
activity, human trafficking, or prostitution).
16
MCL 768.27b.
13 See Section 2.4(A) for a detailed discussion of MRE 404(b).
14The other acts permitted previously appeared in MRE 404(b)(1); those other acts now appear in MR E
404(b)(2). See ADM File No. 2021-10, effective January 1, 2024.

Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-23
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
2. Doctrine of Chances
In many MRE 404(b) cases, it may be necessary to discuss th e
“doctrine of chances,” which states that “as the number o f
incidents of an out-of-the-ordinary event increases in relatio n
to a particular defendant, the objective probability increase s
that the charged act and/or the prior occurrences were not the
result of natural causes.” People v Mardlin, 487 Mich 609, 616
(2010). In other words, “[i]f a type of event linked to th e
defendant occurs with unusual frequency, evidence of th e
occurrences may be probative, for example, of his crimina l
intent or of the absence of mistake or accident because it i s
objectively improbable that such events occur so often i n
relation to the same person due to mere happenstance.” Id. at
617.
In Mardlin, 487 Mich at 612, the defendant’s home was
damaged by fire after which he filed an insurance claim for th e
damage to his home. The defendant was charged with arso n
after an investigation showed that the fire had bee n
intentionally set. Id. During the previous 12 years, th e
defendant had also been “associated with four previous hom e
or vehicle fires—each of which also involved insurance claim s
and arguably benefited defendant in some way[.]” Id. at 613.
The Michigan Supreme Court concluded that evidence of th e
previous fires was admissible “precisely because the y
constituted a series of similar incidents—fires involving home s
and vehicles owned or controlled by defendant—the frequenc y
of which objectively suggested that one or more of the fire s
was not caused by accident.” Id. at 619. The evidence “need no t
bear striking similarity to the offense charged if the theory o f
relevance does not itself center on similarity.” Id. at 620. Th e
Court explained:
“Rather, ‘[w]here the proponents’ theory is not tha t
the acts are so similar that they circumstantially
indicate that they are the work of the accused,
similarity between charged and uncharged conduct is
not required.’ Different theories of relevance require
different degrees of similarity between past act s
and the charged offense to warrant admission.
Thus, the ‘level of similarity required whe n
disproving innocent intent is less than whe n
proving modus operandi.’ ‘When other acts are
offered to show innocent intent, logical relevance
dictates only that the charged crime and the
proffered other acts “are of the same general
category.”’ Past events—such as fires in relation t o
Page 2-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
an arson case—that suggest the absence of acciden t
are offered on the basis of a theory of logical
relevance that is a subset of innocent inten t
theories. As such, the past events need only be of
the same general category as the charged offense.”
Mardlin, 487 Mich at 622-623 (alteration i n
original), quoting People v VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52,
69, 79-80, 80 n 36 (1993).
Where the defendant claimed consent as a defense during hi s
trial for charges arising from a sexual assault, the Court foun d
evidence of additional sexual assault allegations that th e
defendant claimed were consensual to be relevant, explainin g
that “employing the doctrine of chances, it [was ]
extraordinarily improbable that eight unrelated women in fou r
different states would fabricate reports of sexual assault afte r
engaging in consensual sex with defendant.” People v Kelly, 317
Mich App 637, 646 n 4 (2016).
Committee Tip:
MRE 404(a) provides situations where characte r
or propensity evidence is allowed under
pertinent exceptions to the rule. MRE 404(b)
does not provide additional exceptions. It retains
the bar on character/conformity/propensity
evidence and rather allows its evidentiary
subject matter–crimes, wrongs, acts–to be used
for non-character purposes such as those stated
in the rule.
B. Presenting Character Evidence
1. Reputation and Opinion
“When evidence of a person’s character or character trait i s
admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the person’s
reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-
examination of the character witness, the court may allow a n
inquiry into relevant specific instances of the person’s
conduct.” MRE 405(a). However, “these inquiries should no t
be made without: (1) the trial judge determining, in th e
absence of the jury, whether or not the criminal acts actuall y
took place, the time of their commission, and a determinatio n
as to whether they were relevant to the issue being tried, and
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-25
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(2) the trial judge making a careful instruction to the jury as t o
the reasons testimony as to the criminal acts is bein g
admitted.” People v Meshkin, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2022). Inquirie s
“without any basis in fact and without any of the necessar y
protections afforded by the trial court, are improper.” Id. a t
___. Accordingly, a “trial court err[s] by allowing a groundles s
question to waft an unwarranted innuendo into the jury box.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
Evidence of the “reputation among a person’s associates or i n
the community concerning the person’s character” is no t
excluded by the hearsay rule. MRE 803(21). See Chapter 5 for
information on hearsay.
a. Reputation in the Community
A character witness must have knowledge about the
reputation of the individual about whom he or she i s
testifying. People v King, 158 Mich App 672, 678 (1987).
“[T]estimony regarding a person’s character can only
relate what the witness has heard others say about the
person’s reputation, and cannot relate specific instances of
the person’s conduct or the witness’s personal opinion a s
to the person’s character. Id. (a witness’s testimony tha t
“they personally believed the defendant was honest, o r
related specific instances of the defendant’s trustworthy
conduct . . . [did] not rise to the level of admissibl e
character evidence”).
Reputation evidence is admissible when it is based on the
party’s or the witness’s reputation in his or her residential
or business community. People v Bieri, 153 Mich App 696,
17
712-713 (1986). “One’s community can be either wher e
one lives or works, and a reputation may be established
wherever one interacts with others over a period of time.”
Id. at 713 (finding that jail could be considered a
residential community where the amount of time that the
individual spends there is sufficient to establish a
reputation, and the witness in fact becomes acquainted
with the individual’s reputation).
17The Bieri Court considered “the impeachment of a witness’ credibility by evidence of the witness ’
reputation for truthfulness or untruthfulness” under MRE 608. Bieri, 153 Mich App at 712 (holdin g
“admissibility of such evidence is limited and the testimony of a character witness must be based upo n
what he has heard other people in the subject’s residential or business community say about the subject’ s
reputation”). See Section 2.3(E) for information on MRE 608.
Page 2-26 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
b. Opinion Testimony
A party may call a witness “to offer testimony concerning
their personal opinion of [a] person’s character[.]” People v
Roper, 286 Mich App 77, 97 (2009). The witness’s opinio n
must be derived from their association with the perso n
whose character is in question. See People v Dobek, 274
Mich App 58, 102 (2007) (an opinion by a psychologis t
based on psychological testing and interviews is no t
“traditional character evidence” that “fits within the
language of and is admissible under . . . MRE 405(a)”
because the opinion does not come from knowing the
18
person and how he or she lived their life).
c. Extrinsic Evidence
Generally, MRE 405(a) does not permit a party to prov e
character through evidence of specific instances of
conduct. People v Roper, 286 Mich App 77, 104 (2009).
However, “a prosecutor may elicit testimony through a
rebuttal witness concerning specific instances of conduc t
where a defendant places his character at issue on direc t
examination and then denies the occurrence of specifi c
instances of conduct on cross-examination.” Id. at 102.
Rebuttal evidence involving specific conduct may b e
introduced to prove a defendant’s character if all of the
following are true:
• the defendant placed his or her character at issue
during direct examination;
• the prosecution cross-examined the defendan t
regarding specific instances of conduct tha t
“tend[ed] to show that the defendant did no t
have the character trait he or she asserted o n
direct examination”;
• the defendant denied in whole or in part the
specific instances brought up by the prosecutio n
during cross-examination; and
• the rebuttal testimony offered by the prosecutio n
was limited to contradicting the defendant’ s
cross-examination testimony. Roper, 286 Mic h
App at 105.
18The Dobek Court concluded that the psychologist’s opinion was inadmissible because it did not satisf y
the requirements of MRE 702. Nevertheless, the Court briefly touched on defendant’s argument that the
opinion was admissible under MRE 405(a). See Section 4.1(A) for information on MRE 702.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-27
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
2. Specific Instances of Conduct
“When a person’s character or character trait is an essential
element of a charge, claim, or defense, the character or trai t
may also be proved by relevant specific instances of th e
person’s conduct.” MRE 405(b).
Where the defendant was charged with two counts of first-
degree murder, and his defense was that he was not presen t
and did not commit the crime, evidence of specific instances o f
the defendant’s good conduct were inadmissible becaus e
“[n]either the charge nor the defense [made] character a n
essential element.” People v Williams, 134 Mich App 639, 642
(1984). “It is only in the narrow situation where character is a n
element of the offense that specific acts of conduct ar e
admissible to show character under MRE 405(b).” Williams, 13 4
19
Mich App at 642. See also People v Orlewicz, 293 Mich App 96,
104-105 (2011) (where character was not an essential element o f
the defendant’s self-defense claim, evidence of PPOs issued
against the victim were properly excluded as specific instance s
of conduct, but evidence of the victim’s MySpace page shoul d
have been admitted because it did not constitute a specifi c
instance of conduct). The Orlewicz Court stated:
“While a social-networking or other kind of
personal website might well contain depictions of
specific instances of conduct, such a website mus t
be deemed a gestalt and not simply a conglomerate
of parts. When regarded by itself, a social-
networking or personal website is more in the
nature of a semipermanent yet fluid
autobiography presented to the world. In effect, i t
is self-directed and self-controlled general-
character evidence. Clearly, because people change
over time, its relevance might be limited only t o
recent additions or changes; furthermore, it i s
obviously possible for people to misrepresen t
themselves, which could present a fact issue. But i n
the abstract, social-networking and personal
websites constitute general reputational evidence
rather than evidence concerning specific instance s
of conduct[.]” Orlewicz, 293 Mich App at 104-105.
19See Section 2.3(C) for discussion regarding evidence of character of the defendant.
Page 2-28 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
Committee Tip:
Be cautious of basing character by reputation
decisions on social media gestalt generalities.
MRE 404(a) concerns relevant character and
pertinent traits of character not satisfied by
general reputation evidence - even in the form of
social media.
“[E]vidence of [a] decedent’s specific acts of violence i s
admissible only to prove an essential element of self-defense,
such as a reasonable apprehension of harm.” People v Edwards,
328 Mich App 29, 37 (2019). The trial court erred in precluding
defendant from admitting “evidence of the decedent’s specifi c
act of violence committed against him personally” becaus e
“defendant had to present evidence that he had a reasonabl e
belief that he had to use deadly force to prevent his death or t o
prevent great bodily harm to himself,” and the evidence wa s
“directly relevant to an ultimate issue in his defense.” Id. at 37-
38. The trial court also erred in summarily denying th e
defendant’s request to admit evidence of “specific acts o f
violence by the decedent [against third persons] that [the
defendant] knew about at the time of the shooting to show hi s
reasonable apprehension of harm” because “the trial court wa s
required to examine each allegation and then determine it s
admissibility.” Id. at 39-40 (remanded for the trial court t o
“determine whether each of the decedent’s violent acts agains t
third persons is relevant to the self-defense claim,” and als o
“whether the evidence is admissible under MRE 403”).
Committee Tip:
It might be best to ask the proponent about the
purpose for admission of specific instances of
conduct. If they are known to defendant and
formulate a state of mind, they are not character
evidence. Specific instances of conduct, sought
for admission otherwise, are limited by MR E
405(b).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-29
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
C. Evidence of Defendant’s Character in Criminal Case
1. Offered by Defendant
While “[e]vidence of a person’s character or character trait i s
not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion th e
person acted in accordance with the character or trait,” “a
defendant may offer evidence of the defendant’s pertinen t
trait[.]” MRE 404(a)(2)(A). While MRE 404(a)(2) “allows a
criminal defendant an absolute right to introduce evidence o f
his character to prove that he could not have committed th e
20
crime[,]” People v Whitfield, 425 Mich 116, 130-131 (1986), a
defendant may only present favorable evidence in the form o f
reputation or opinion testimony. MRE 405(a).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion in precludin g
defendant from presenting witnesses that would have testified
as to her character and reputation for being a law-abidin g
citizen in her criminal trial of conducting an unlicensed
gambling operation because defendant’s “truthfulness o r
general reputation for adhering to the law [had] no bearing o n
whether she intended to operate . . . in a manner that met th e
definition of a gambling operation,” especially where it ha d
already been determined on appeal that her “intent to ‘brea k
the law’ was not relevant to the illegal-gambling charges. ”
People v Zitka, 335 Mich App 324, 342 (2021) (the court did no t
err by excluding the evidence because defendant “sought t o
introduce this evidence only to make an irrelevant point”).
2. Offered by Prosecution
If “a defendant . . . offer[s] evidence of the defendant’ s
pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecuto r
may offer evidence to rebut it[.]” MRE 404(a)(2)(A). If “the
defendant does not offer character evidence, a prosecutor’ s
attempt to elicit character evidence regarding the defendant o n
cross-examination of another witness is not permitted” by
21
MRE 404(a)(2)(A). People v Wilder, 502 Mich 57, 67-68 (2018 )
(remanding to the trial court to determine whether the error i n
admitting the evidence was harmless). However, “once th e
defendant presents testimony or other evidence that he or sh e
has a good character trait, the defendant has opened the door;
20 However, failure to allow the defendant to introduce admissible character evidence may be harmless
error unless “after an examination of the entire cause, it affirmatively appears that it is more probable tha n
not that the error was outcome determinative.” People v King, 297 Mich App 465, 472, 479 (2012).
21The provisions previously found in MRE 404(a)(1) now appear in MRE 404(a)(2)(A). See ADM File No.
2021-10, effective January 1, 2024.
Page 2-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
the prosecutor may then walk through it, armed with contrar y
evidence, on rebuttal, and the fact that the contrary evidence i s
damaging to the defense does not equate with error.” People v
Steele, 283 Mich App 472, 486 (2009).
The prosecution is limited to rebutting the trait or trait s
introduced by the defendant. People v Johnson, 409 Mich 552 ,
561 (1980). “A defendant does not open the door to any and al l
evidence concerning his character merely by basing a n
argument on some aspects of his character. He opens the doo r
only for evidence that his character is not what he claims it t o
be.” Id.
The trial court properly allowed the prosecution to presen t
specific instances of defendant’s conduct to rebut evidence o f
his character for peacefulness after the defendant testified “I’ m
not the person that . . . would want to [react with violence] ,
especially to a friend,” and denied that he reacted wit h
violence to other situations in which he was confronted by a n
unhappy person. People v Roper, 286 Mich App 77, 94-10 5
(2009).
D. Evidence of Victim’s Character in Criminal Case
1. Homicide Victim
a. Offered by Defendant
“[I]n a homicide case, when self-defense is an issue, the
defendant may offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trai t
for aggression, and if the evidence is admitted, the
prosecution may: (i) offer evidence of the defendant’ s
same trait, and (ii) offer evidence of the alleged victim’ s
trait for peacefulness to rebut evidence that the alleged
victim was the first aggressor[.]” A defendant assertin g
self-defense in a homicide case may offer “evidence of the
alleged victim's trait for aggression.” MRE 404(a)(2)(B).
Character evidence of a deceased victim can be offered t o
prove that the victim acted in conformity with his or her
violent reputation on a particular occasion, and thus, wa s
the aggressor in the case at hand. People v Harris, 458 Mic h
310, 315-316 (1998). If the defendant offers character
evidence of the deceased victim to show that the
defendant acted in self-defense, the evidence is being
offered to show the defendant’s state of mind, and the
defendant must have had knowledge of the victim’ s
violent reputation before the evidence will be admitted.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-31
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Id. at 316. If, however, the character evidence is being
offered to show that the victim was the probable
aggressor, the defendant need not know of the victim’ s
reputation at the time. People v Orlewicz, 293 Mich App 96,
104 (2011). “[T]his type of character evidence may only be
admitted in the form of reputation testimony, not by
testimony regarding specific instances of conduct unles s
the testimony regarding those instances is independently
admissible for some other reason or where character is a n
essential element of a claim or defense.” Id. (finding tha t
social networking and personal websites may be used a s
character evidence because they are self-edited and thu s
“constitute general reputational evidence rather tha n
evidence concerning specific instances of conduct”).
In cases where the defendant is claiming self-defense, a
jury instruction on the alleged victim’s past acts or
reputation may be appropriate. See M Crim JI 7.23. M
Crim JI 7.23(1) addresses past violent acts committed by
the alleged victim. M Crim JI 7.23(2) addresses the alleged
victim’s reputation for cruelty and violence.
b. Offered by Prosecution
If self-defense is an issue in a homicide case and the
defendant introduces evidence of the alleged victim’s trai t
for aggression, the prosecution may “offer evidence of the
defendant's same trait” and “offer evidence of the alleged
victim's trait for peacefulness to rebut evidence that the
alleged victim was the first aggressor[.]” MRE
404(a)(2)(B)(i)-(ii).
Committee Tip:
When it comes to MRE 404(a)((2), the prosecuto r
is limited to rebutting the accused’s reputation
or opinion character evidence and is not in a first
strike position.
2. Sexual Assault Victim
The rape-shield statute, MCL 750.520j, provides:
“(1) Evidence of specific instances of the victim’ s
sexual conduct, opinion evidence of the victim’ s
Page 2-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of the
victim’s sexual conduct shall not be admitted
under [MCL 750.520b] to [MCL 750.520g] unles s
and only to the extent that the judge finds that the
following proposed evidence is material to a fact a t
issue in the case and that its inflammatory or
prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative
value:
(a) Evidence of the victim’s past sexua l
conduct with the actor.
(b) Evidence of specific instances of sexua l
activity showing the source or origin o f
semen, pregnancy, or disease.
(2) If the defendant proposes to offer evidence
described in [MCL 750.520j(1)(a)] or [MCL
750.520j(1)(b)], the defendant within 10 days after
the arraignment on the information shall file a
written motion and offer of proof. The court may
order an in camera hearing to determine whether
the proposed evidence is admissible under [MCL
750.520j(1)]. If new information is discovered
during the course of the trial that may make the
evidence described in [MCL 750.520j(1)(a)] or
[MCL 750.520j(1)(b)] admissible, the judge may
order an in camera hearing to determine whethe r
the proposed evidence is admissible under [MCL
750.520j(1)].”
“As a practical matter, . . . the rape-shield statute has a broa d
purpose and reflects a ‘legislative determination that inquirie s
into sex histories, even when minimally relevant, carry a
danger of unfairly prejudicing and misleading the jury.’” People
v Masi (Masi II), ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025), quoting People v
Arenda, 416 Mich 1, 10 (1982). Indeed, “[t]he rape-shield statut e
was aimed at thwarting the then-existing practice o f
impeaching the complainant’s testimony with evidence of th e
complainant’s prior consensual sexual activity, whic h
discouraged victims from testifying because they knew thei r
private lives would be cross-examined.” Masi II, ___ Mich a t
___, quoting People v Adair, 452 Mich 473, 480 (1996) (alteratio n
in original). In other words, “the rape-shield statute constitute s
a legislative policy determination that sexual conduct o r
reputation regarding sexual conduct as evidence of characte r
and for impeachment, while perhaps logically relevant, is no t
legally relevant.” Masi II, ___ Mich at ___, citing People v Sharpe,
502 Mich 313, 326 (2018) (cleaned up). Accordingly, “ a
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-33
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
witness’s ‘sexual history is usually irrelevant as impeachmen t
evidence [under MRE 608] because it has no bearing o n
character for truthfulness.’” Masi II, ___ Mich at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted).
Prior sexual conduct. “[A] specific instance of the victim’ s
sexual conduct [admissible under MCL 750.520j(1)(a)-(b)] mus t
relate to a particular occurrence of the victim’s sexual
conduct.” Sharpe, 502 Mich at 328. “The rape-shield statute
does not define ‘sexual conduct.’” Masi II, ___ Mich at ___ .
However, “the plain meaning of ‘sexual conduct’ in MCL
750.520j(1) [encompasses] individual behaviors—including
acts and responses—that involve or are associated with sexua l
activities.” Masi II, ___ Mich at ___ (“holding that ‘sexual
conduct’ includes both voluntary and involuntary behavior”).
“This interpretation does not require an act of volition.” Id. a t
___ (“The “phrase ‘sexual conduct’ is not modified b y
‘voluntary’ or ‘consensual’”.). The Masi II Court reasoned “tha t
the same policy considerations underlying the rape-shiel d
statute’s general prohibition into a complainant’s consensua l
sexual history apply equally to involuntary acts o r
nonconsensual sexual behavior.” Id. at ___. “Just as wit h
consensual sexual history, evidence of a victim’s prior sexual
abuse by a third party could be used to harass, embarrass, o r
shame the victim.” Id. at ___. “Similarly, such evidence als o
might carry a danger of unfairly prejudicing and misleadin g
the jury, and might discourage victims from testifying.” Id. a t
___ (quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly,
“nonvolitional acts, such as involuntarily viewin g
pornography during the course of sexual abuse, constitut e
‘sexual conduct’ within the meaning of the rape-shiel d
statute.” Id. at ___.
See also MRE 404(a)(2)(C), which provides that the defendan t
in a criminal-sexual-conduct case may offer evidence of “th e
alleged victim’s past sexual conduct with the defendant,” an d
“specific instances of sexual activity showing the source o r
origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease.” MRE 404(a)(1) “only
excludes character evidence used to prove conformity to a
character trait”; it is error to exclude evidence under MRE
404(a)(2)(C) where a valid, nonpropensity explanation for th e
admission of the evidence has been articulated. Sharpe, 50 2
Mich at 332 n 11.
Constitutional right to confrontation and right to present a
defense. “While evidence of prior sexual conduct is generall y
prohibited, there are circumstances in which a minor’s sexua l
knowledge is so probative that the defendant’s [constitutional ]
right to confrontation or right to present a defense hinges o n
Page 2-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
explaining why that knowledge exists.” Masi, ___ Mich at ___
(observing that “in these circumstances, a defendant ma y
probe a minor’s sexual knowledge for the limited purposes o f
rebutting the jury’s natural assumption concerning a child’ s
sexual innocence and of protecting the defendant’s rights” )
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
While “MCL 750.520j generally excludes evidence of a rape
victim’s prior sexual conduct with others, and sexual
reputation, when offered to prove that the conduct at issue wa s
consensual or for general impeachment[,]” “in certain limited
situations, such evidence may not only be relevant, but it s
admission may be required to preserve a defendant’ s
constitutional right to confrontation.” People v Butler, 513 Mic h
24, 29 (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (holdin g
that “the defendant should be permitted to show that th e
complainant has made false accusations of rape in the past”).
“When applying the rape-shield statute, trial courts mus t
balance the rights of the victim and the defendant in eac h
case.” People v Benton, 294 Mich App 191, 198 (2011). If a trial
court determines that evidence of a victim’s past sexual
conduct is not admissible under one of the statutor y
exceptions, it must consider whether admission is required t o
preserve the defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation;
if the evidence is not so required, the court “‘should . . . favor
exclusion of [the] evidence[.]’” Id. at 197, quoting People v
Hackett, 421 Mich 338, 349 (1984).
“The rape-shield law does not prohibit defense counsel fro m
introducing ‘specific instances of sexual activity . . . to show
the origin of a physical condition when evidence of tha t
condition is offered by the prosecution to prove one of th e
elements of the crime charged provided the inflammatory o r
prejudicial nature of the rebuttal evidence does not outweig h
its probative value.’” People v Shaw, 315 Mich App 668, 68 0
(2016), quoting People v Mikula, 84 Mich App 108, 115 (1978).
Voluntary disclosure. “There is no indication from ou r
Legislature or in our caselaw that the rape-shield statute wa s
designed to prevent a complainant’s disclosure of her ow n
sexual history or its attendant consequences.” Sharpe, 502 Mic h
at 330-331. Accordingly, voluntarily-offered evidence of a
complainant’s “pregnancy, abortion, and lack of sexual histor y
to bolster her allegations of criminal sexual conduct agains t
defendant” may be admissible; however “admission of thi s
type of evidence may open the door to the introduction o f
evidence whose admission may otherwise have bee n
precluded by the rape-shield statute.” Id. at 330, 331 n 10.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-35
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
a. Evaluating Admissibility of Evidence of
Complainant’s Prior Sexual Conduct: Trial Court
Procedure
Trial courts must employ the following procedure whe n
evaluating the admissibility of evidence of the
complainant’s prior sexual conduct:
“The defendant is obligated initially to mak e
an offer of proof as to the proposed evidenc e
and to demonstrate its relevance to th e
purpose for which it is sought to be admitted.
Unless there is a sufficient showing o f
relevancy in the defendant’s offer of proof, th e
trial court will deny the motion. If there is a
sufficient offer of proof as to a defendant’ s
constitutional right to confrontation, a s
distinct simply from use of sexual conduct a s
evidence of character or for impeachment, th e
trial court shall order an in camera evidentiary
hearing to determine the admissibility of suc h
evidence in light of the constitutional inquir y
previously stated. At this hearing, the tria l
court has, as always, the responsibility t o
restrict the scope of cross-examination t o
prevent questions which would harass,
annoy, or humiliate sexual assault victims an d
to guard against mere fishing expeditions.
Moreover, the trial court continues to posses s
the discretionary power to exclude relevan t
evidence offered for any purpose where it s
probative value is substantially outweighe d
by the risks of unfair prejudice, confusion o f
issues, or misleading the jury.”[People v Butler,
513 Mich 24, 30 (2024), quoting People v
Hackett, 421 Mich 338, 350-351 (1984)).]
The trial court is required to make an explicit finding o n
whether “defendant’s offer of proof was sufficient t o
require an in camera evidentiary hearing under Hackett. ”
Butler, 513 Mich at 31. “Once a sufficient offer of proof is
made, the in camera evidentiary hearing is not optional.”
Id. at 32. Accordingly, “once a sufficient offer of proof i s
made by a defendant, the trial court must hold an i n
camera evidentiary hearing to determine whether th e
defendant is constitutionally entitled to present particular
evidence that is otherwise excluded under the rape-shield
statute.” People v Masi (Masi II), ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025).
Page 2-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
“At the [in camera evidentiary] hearing, the court mus t
determine whether the defendant has shown that (1) the
prior act occurred, (2) the act closely resembled those a t
issue, (3) the act is relevant to a material issue, (4) the
evidence is necessary to the defendant’s case, and (5) the
probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial
effect.” Id. at ___ (stating “that this test provides the
appropriate balance between protecting a defendant’ s
right to confrontation and right to present a defense and
protecting the interests of minors who are subjected t o
this sensitive examination”). “The factors . . . properly
balance both the interests of a defendant and the interest s
of a minor child by allowing for the examination of a
minor child’s sexual knowledge only when there has bee n
a sufficient showing that the evidence is necessary t o
preserve a defendant’s right to confrontation or right t o
present a defense.” Id. at ___ (overruling People v Morse,
231 Mich App 324 (1998), “to the extent that it requires a
conviction related to the prior sexual conduct of a
complainant”).
“‘[I]n ruling on the admissibility of the proffered
evidence, the trial court should rule against the admissio n
of evidence of a complainant’s prior sexual conduct wit h
third persons unless that ruling would unduly infringe o n
the defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation.’”
Butler, ___ Mich at ___ (quoting Hackett, 421 Mich at 351).
The trial court is required to make an explicit finding o n
whether “defendant’s offer of proof was sufficient t o
require an in camera evidentiary hearing under Hackett. ”
Butler, ___ Mich at ___. “There must be a showing of at
least some apparently credible and potentially admissible
evidence that the prior allegation was false.” Id. at ___.
“Once a sufficient offer of proof is made, the in camera
evidentiary hearing is not optional.” Id. at ___. In Butler,
the Michigan Supreme Court held that “defendant’s offer
of proof was sufficient, but an evidentiary hearing i s
required under Hackett before the trial court may admi t
the evidence.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the trial cour t
erred by failing to conduct an in camera evidentiar y
hearing before granting admission of the evidence.”)
However, “the ultimate question of admissibility at trial”
requires determining whether defendant has satisfied the
evidentiary burden of proving that the complainant’ s
prior allegations were false. Id. at ___ (stating “[s]ince th e
adoption of an appropriate standard [for making tha t
determination] is a question of first impression i n
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-37
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Michigan, we believe it is appropriate for the lower court s
to assess this question in the first instance”).
b. Examples of Application of Character Evidence
of Sexual Assault Victim
Past sexual conduct. “‘[P]ast’ sexual conduct refers t o
conduct that has occurred before the evidence is offered
at trial.” People v Adair, 452 Mich 473, 483 (1996). In Adair,
the defendant was charged with sexually assaulting hi s
wife and sought to introduce evidence of specifi c
incidents when he and his wife engaged in consensual
sexual relations after the alleged assault. Id. at 477. In
deciding whether subsequent sexual relations are
sufficiently probative to be admitted, the court should
consider (1) the length of time between the alleged assaul t
and the subsequent sexual relations, and (2) whether the
complainant and the defendant had a personal
relationship before the alleged assault. Id. at 486-487. In
explaining its reasoning, the Court stated:
“On a common-sense level, a trial court coul d
find that the closer in time to the allege d
sexual assault that the complainant engage d
in subsequent consensual sexual relation s
with her alleged assailant, the stronger th e
argument would be that if indeed she ha d
been sexually assaulted, she would not hav e
consented to sexual relations with him in th e
immediate aftermath of sexual assault.
Accordingly, the evidence may be probative.
Conversely, the greater the time interval, th e
less probative force the evidence may have,
depending on the circumstances.
“Even so, time should not be the only factor.
The trial court should also carefully conside r
the circumstances and nature of th e
relationship between the complainant and th e
defendant. If the two did not have a persona l
relationship before the alleged sexual assault,
then any consensual sexual relations after th e
alleged sexual assault would likely be mor e
probative than if the two had been livin g
together in a long-term marital relationship.
Additionally, the trial court could find tha t
there may be other human emotion s
intertwined with the relationship that ma y
Page 2-38 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
have interceded, leading to consensual sexua l
relations in spite of an earlier sexual assault.
Depending on the circumstances, the tria l
court may find that these other consideration s
have intensified the inflammatory an d
prejudicial nature of subsequent consensua l
sexual conduct evidence and properl y
conclude that it should be precluded o r
limited.” Adair, 452 Mich at 486-487.
Viewing lawful pornography (not during the course of
sexual abuse). “[E]vidence of a victim viewing lawful
pornography, without more, is not evidence of ‘sexual
conduct’ subject to [the exclusionary bar of] Michigan’ s
rape-shield statute.” People v Masi (Masi I), 346 Mich Ap p
1, 15 (2023); People v Masi (Masi II), ___ Mich ___, ___ n 1
(2025) (affirming in part and vacating in part the decision s
of the trial court and the Court of Appeals).Prior sexual
abuse. “[E]vidence related to prior sexual abuse of a
minor is ‘sexual conduct’ under MCL 750.520j(1).” Masi II,
___ Mich ___, ___ (2025) (holding that “evidence of prior
sexual abuse, whether voluntary or involuntary, is ‘sexual
conduct’ that is generally barred by the rape-shield
statute”). This includes occasions when the abus e
involves forcing the victim to watch pornography, whic h
unlike a victim watching pornography on their ow n
accord, is itself “alleged criminal activity that [is] a
component of the involuntary sexual conduct suffered by
[the victim].” Masi I, 346 Mich App at 18. Accordingly,
“nonvolitional acts, such as involuntarily viewing
pornography during the course of sexual abuse,
constitute ‘sexual conduct’ within the meaning of the
rape-shield statute.” Masi II, ___ Mich at ___. However ,
“under some circumstances, admission of evidence
regarding a complainant’s prior sexual abuse i s
constitutionally required in light of a defendant’s right t o
confrontation and right to present a defense.” Id. at ___
“In [People v Arenda, 416 Mich 1, 8-11 (1982), the Michiga n
Supreme] Court held that the rape-shield statute could
constitutionally bar the admission of evidence related to a
minor victim’s sexual conduct with others to explain age-
inappropriate sexual knowledge and that such evidence
was properly excluded in that case.” Masi II, ___ Mich a t
___ n 4. “Arenda did not create a per se rule that th e
admission of such evidence was never required to protec t
a defendant’s constitutional rights.” Id. “Although th e
focus of [the] Arenda decision was whether the rape-shield
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-39
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
statute infringed upon the defendant’s Sixth Amendmen t
right of confrontation, [the Michigan Supreme] Cour t
implicitly recognized that prior alleged sexual abuse of a
minor victim is within the rape-shield statute’ s
protections.” Masi II, ___ Mich at ___ (citation omitted).
The Arenda Court “noted that evidence concerning th e
source of a victim’s sexual knowledge and the victim’ s
‘ability to describe a sexual act may be relevant,’
particularly in cases involving young or inexperienced
victims.” Id. at ___. “In other words, [the Arenda] Cour t
implicitly recognized that prior alleged sexual acts of a
minor victim involving a third party constituted ‘sexual
conduct’ within the meaning of MCL 750.520j(1).” Masi II,
___ Mich at ___.
Sexual contact with someone other than the defendant.
“The trial court’s refusal to allow [testimony from the
victim’s former boyfriend about his consensual sex wit h
the victim before she was examined by a pediatrician wh o
testified that he found extensive hymenal changes and a
chronic anal fissure and that these findings were
consistent with those of either a sexually active adul t
[22]
woman or an abused child] for purposes of the Ginther
hearing was erroneous because such testimony i s
permitted as an offer of proof if the applicability of the
rape-shield statute is at issue.” People v Shaw, 315 Mic h
App 668, 679 n 7 (2016). Further, because the defendant’ s
guilt was the only likely explanation for the victim’ s
extensive hymenal changes and chronic anal fissure,
“evidence of an alternative explanation for the hymenal
changes and source for the chronic anal fissure would
have been admissible under the exception to the rape-
shield statute[.]” Id. at 680.
Sexual contact between victims. “[E]vidence of sexua l
conduct between [two minor victims] falls squarel y
within the rape-shield statute’s exclusion for evidence of
‘specific instances of the victim’s sexual conduct,’ and the
evidence does not fall within either of the statute’s narrow
exceptions.” Masi I, 346 Mich App at 21-22, quoting MCL
750.520j(1).
Evidence of abortion. Because evidence of an abortion is
“not evidence of a specific instance of a victim’s sexual
conduct,” it does not fall under the purview of MCL
750.520j. People v Sharpe, 502 Mich 313, 328 (2018).
22People v Ginther, 390 Mich 436 (1973).
Page 2-40 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
“Although this evidence necessarily implies that sexual
activity occurred that caused [a] pregnancy, the
pregnancy and abortion are not evidence regarding a
specific instance of sexual conduct.” Id. at 328. Although
the evidence was “not excluded under the rape-shield
statute,” the Sharpe Court analyzed whether it wa s
“otherwise admissible under the Michigan Rules of
Evidence,” concluding that the trial court abused it s
discretion when it excluded evidence of the complainant’ s
abortion as inadmissible character evidence because the
prosecutor identified a valid nonpropensity explanatio n
for its admission. Id. at 331, 332 n 11 (evidence of th e
abortion “definitively demonstrat[ed] that sexual
penetration occurred” and also “explain[ed] the lack of
DNA evidence to identify the man who impregnated [the
complainant]”).
Lack of sexual activity with people other than the
defendant. Evidence that a complainant “did not engage
in other sexual intercourse . . . does not fall within th e
plain language of the rape-shield statute, [MCL
750.520j,]” for exclusion at trial because the “evidenc e
demonstrates an absence of conduct, not a ‘specifi c
instance’ of sexual conduct.” Sharpe, 502 Mich at 330.
However, because the evidence was “not excluded under
the rape-shield statute,” the Sharpe Court analyze d
whether it was “otherwise admissible under the Michiga n
Rules of Evidence.” Id. at 331. It concluded that the tria l
court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of
the complainant’s lack of other sexual partners a s
inadmissible character evidence because the prosecutor
identified a valid nonpropensity explanation for it s
admission. Id. at 332 n 11 (evidence of the complainant’ s
lack of sexual partners eliminated the possibility tha t
someone other than the defendant impregnated her).
Evidence of pregnancy. Because evidence of a pregnancy
is “not evidence of a specific instance of a victim’s sexual
conduct,” it does not fall under the purview of MCL
750.520j. Sharpe, 502 Mich at 328. “Although this evidenc e
necessarily implies that sexual activity occurred tha t
caused the pregnancy, the pregnancy . . . [is] not evidenc e
regarding a specific instance of sexual conduct.” Id.
Although the evidence was “not excluded under the rape-
shield statute,” the Sharpe Court analyzed whether it wa s
“otherwise admissible under the Michigan Rules of
Evidence,” concluding that the trial court properly
admitted evidence of the complainant’s pregnancy. Id. a t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-41
Section 2.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
331, 334-335 (evidence of the pregnancy was probative of
the issue of whether sexual penetration occurred).
E. A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness
(Impeachment)
Evidence of a witness’s character may be admitted under MRE 607–
MRE 609. MRE 404(a)(3). This section discusses MRE 608. See
Section 3.7 for information on the credibility of a witness, MRE 607,
and Section 3.9 for information on impeachment by evidence of a
criminal conviction, MRE 609.
“By testifying on another matter, a witness does not waive any
privilege against self-incrimination for testimony that relates only t o
the witness’s character for truthfulness.” MRE 608(b).
1. Reputation or Opinion
“A witness’s credibility may be attacked or supported b y
testimony about the witness’s reputation for having a characte r
for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by testimony in the for m
of an opinion about that character. But evidence of truthfu l
character is admissible only after the witness’s character for
truthfulness has been attacked.” MRE 608(a).
Where a party attacks a witness’s credibility, but not th e
witness’s character for truthfulness, the opposing party ma y
not present evidence to bolster the witness’s truthful character.
People v Lukity, 460 Mich 484, 490-491 (1999) (the trial cour t
abused its discretion in admitting evidence of th e
complainant’s truthful character where the defense counsel
asserted during his opening statement that the complainan t
had emotional problems which affected her ability to describ e
the alleged sexual assaults; MRE 608(a) was not implicated
because the defendant’s opening statement did not attack th e
complainant’s truthful character).
It may be error for a court to allow character testimony tha t
goes “beyond [the witness’s] reputation for truthfulness and
encompasse[s] [the witness’s] overall ‘integrity.’” Ykimoff v W A
Foote Mem Hosp, 285 Mich App 80, 102 (2009). In Ykimoff ( a
medical malpractice case), the defendant offered a surveillanc e
videotape into evidence, showing the plaintiff engaging i n
certain activities, which “impliedly impugned plaintiff’ s
truthfulness, as it suggested that plaintiff’s residual injurie s
were not as extensive or limiting as alleged.” Id. However,
admitting the evidence was harmless error because witnes s
Page 2-42 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.3
testimony tended to prove the same things that the videotap e
showed. Id. at 103.
“[A] witness’s ‘sexual history is usually irrelevant a s
impeachment evidence [under MRE 608] because it has n o
bearing on character for truthfulness.’” People v Masi (Masi II),
___ Mich ___, ___ (2025), quoting People v Adair, 452 Mich 473,
481 (1996).
2. Specific Instances of Conduct
MRE 608(b) prohibits extrinsic evidence of specific instances of
a witness’s conduct to attack or support the witness’s characte r
for truthfulness, except for a criminal conviction under MRE
609; however, on cross-examination, the court may allo w
inquiry into specific instances of conduct if they are probativ e
of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of th e
witness or “another witness whose character the witness bein g
cross-examined has testified about.” MRE 608(b).
A “complainant’s statements concerning a threat to make prio r
false allegations were not inadmissible hearsay because the y
were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted”; “[r]ather,
the complainant’s out-of-court statements were offered t o
directly attack the complainant’s credibility.” People v Martinez,
507 Mich 855 (2021). Although absent an exception,
“[c]haracter evidence is not admissible to prove an action i n
conformity therewith, . . . MRE 608 provides such a n
exception[, and t]he statements were admissible pursuant t o
MRE 608(b)[.]” Martinez, 507 Mich at 855. The “evidence wa s
specific, highly relevant, and acknowledged by th e
complainant while under oath during the preliminar y
examination,” and “in light of the absence of other direct o r
circumstantial evidence supporting the defendant’ s
convictions, the exclusion of this impeachment evidence wa s
not harmless error. The risk of prejudice is especially high in a
case such as this in which the evidence essentially presents a
one-on-one credibility contest between the complainant and
the defendant because of the reasonable probability that thi s
additional attack on the complainant’s credibility would hav e
tipped the scales in favor of finding a reasonable doubt abou t
the defendant’s guilt.” Id. (cleaned up).
Where a witness was not called as a character witness and di d
not testify on direct examination about the plaintiff’ s
truthfulness or untruthfulness, the defendant was no t
permitted to cross-examine the witness about specifi c
instances of the plaintiff’s conduct for the purpose o f
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-43
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
impeaching the plaintiff. Guerrero v Smith, 280 Mich App 647,
655 (2008). In Guerrero, the plaintiff testified about his limited
marijuana use. Id. at 654. Defense counsel cross-examined one
of the plaintiff’s witnesses in an effort to impeach the plaintiff’ s
testimony regarding his marijuana use. Id. The Cour t
concluded that the witness’s testimony should not have bee n
admitted because it did not satisfy the technical requirement s
of MRE 608(b)(2). Guerrero, 280 Mich App at 654. The Cour t
stated:
“Before specific instances concerning another
witness’s character for truthfulness or
untruthfulness may be inquired into on cross-
examination, the witness subject to cross-
examination must already have testified on direct
examination regarding the other witness’ s
character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. ”
Guerrero, 280 Mich App at 654-655.
3. Impeachment by Contradiction
Impeachment by contradiction “can be a proper purpose fo r
the admission of other-acts evidence” under MRE 404(b), an d
it “usually occurs when a prosecutor seeks to cross-examine a
defendant about prior convictions in order to impeach a
defendant’s blanket denial on direct examination of eve r
engaging in conduct similar to the charged conduct.” People v
Wilder, 502 Mich 57, 64 (2018). However, a defendant’s prior
conviction(s) may also be admissible for purposes o f
impeaching a witness by contradiction. See id. at 64 n 9 (notin g
that “admissibility of defendant’s prior convictions to impeac h
by contradiction a witness’ testimony is governed by MRE
404(b),” which requires the evidence to be both logically and
legally relevant; the questions asked in this case were no t
relevant to a proper purpose). See Section 2.4 for more
information on the admission of other-acts evidence unde r
MRE 404(b).

2.4 Other-Acts Evidence
A. Rule 404(b) and Section 768.27
“When a party intends to offer evidence of other wrongful acts, the
trial court must consider: (1) whether the evidence is offered for a
23See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Other-Acts Evidence Flowchart.
Page 2-44 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
proper purpose under MRE 404(b), (2) whether the evidence i s
relevant under MRE 401 and MRE 402, and (3) whether the
probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by
unfair prejudice under MRE 403.” People v Jones, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2025) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible t o
prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular
occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.” MRE
404(b)(1). However, “[i]f it is material, the evidence may b e
admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, scheme, plan, or system in doing
an act, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.”
MRE 404(b)(2).
“In any criminal case where the defendant’s motive, intent, the
absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’ s
scheme, plan or system in doing an act, is material, any like acts or
other acts of the defendant which may tend to show his motive,
intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the
defendant’s scheme, plan or system in doing the act, in question,
may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or
subsequent thereto; notwithstanding that such proof may show or
tend to show the commission of another or prior or subsequen t
crime by the defendant.” MCL 768.27.
“[W]hile MRE 404(b) and MCL 768.27 certainly overlap, they are no t
interchangeable.” People v Jackson, 498 Mich 246, 269 (2015). MCL
768.27 authorizes the admission of other-acts evidence for the sam e
24
purposes listed in MRE 404(b)(2) when one or more of the matter s
“is material.” Jackson, 498 Mich at 269. “Unlike MCL 768.27,
however, MRE 404(b)’s list of such purposes is expressly
nonexhaustive, and thus plainly contemplates the admission of
evidence that may fall outside the statute’s articulated scope.”
Jackson, 498 Mich at 269. Accordingly, “MCL 768.27 does no t
purport to define the limits of admissibility for evidence of
uncharged conduct.” Jackson, 498 Mich at 269.
“Other-acts evidence may also be admissible without regard t o
MRE 404(b) if the other acts are so intertwined with the charge d
offense that they directly prove the charged offense or their
presentation is necessary to comprehend the context of the charged
offense.” People v Spaulding, 332 Mich App 638, 650 (2020). “Suc h
evidence is also admissible to fill what would otherwise be a
chronological and conceptual void regarding the events to the

Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
finder of fact.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). I n
Spaulding, other-acts evidence “consisting of [the victim’s]
description of . . . four [prior] incidents” was relevant “in proving
defendant’s connection to aggravated stalking,” and “did not rely
on an improper character-to-conduct inference.” Id. at 650, 652
(quotation marks and citation omitted). Although evidence of
“defendant’s three communications . . . did not explicitly convey an y
threats[,] [i]t was impossible to comprehend the significance of thos e
communications without an understanding of the history of the
relationship between [the victim] and defendant.” Id. at 651 .
“Without knowing that history, the communications would have
been innocuous. The prior incidents were critical to understand
why a reasonable person would have felt . . . scared by defendant’ s
conduct under the circumstances.” Id. at 651-652 (noting
“defendant’s prior acts of domestic violence were direct evidence of
his aggravated stalking: it was literally his own prior misconduc t
that made the communications at issue crimes”).
1. Applicability of MRE 404(b)
“Evidence relevant to a noncharacter purpose is admissible
under MRE 404(b) even if it also reflects on a defendant’ s
character. Evidence is inadmissible under this rule only if it is
relevant solely to the defendant’s character or criminal
propensity.” People v Mardlin, 487 Mich 609, 615-616 (2010).
“MRE 404(b) only applies to evidence of crimes, wrongs, o r
acts ‘other’ than the ‘conduct at issue in the case’ that risks a n
impermissible character-to-conduct inference. Accordingly,
acts comprised by or directly evidencing the ‘conduct at issue ’
are not subject to scrutiny under MRE 404(b).” People v Jackson,
498 Mich 246, 262 (2015) (holding that “[e]vidence that th e
defendant,” who was charged with CSC-I involving a child
who was a member of the church where the defendant serve d
as a pastor, “previously engaged in sexual relationships wit h
other parishioners, above or below the age of consent, [fell ]
well within this scope of coverage” and required th e
prosecution to provide notice under MRE 404(b)).
“MRE 404(b) applies to the admissibility of evidence of other
acts of any person, such as a defendant, a plaintiff, or a
witness.” People v Rockwell, 188 Mich App 405, 409-410 (1991) .
This includes “admissibility of defendant’s prior convictions t o
impeach by contradiction a witness’ testimony[.]” People v
Wilder, 502 Mich 57, 64, n 9 (2018). The rule applies to both civil
and criminal cases. Wlosinski v Cohn, 269 Mich App 303, 322
(2005).
Page 2-46 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
In order for other-acts evidence to be admissible under MRE
25
404(b)(2), a party must “show that it is (1) offered for a
proper purpose, i.e., to prove something other than th e
defendant’s propensity to act in a certain way, (2) logicall y
relevant, and (3) not unfairly prejudicial under MRE 403.” Roc k
v Crocker, 499 Mich 247, 257 (2016). “Before applying MRE 403,
the trial court must consider whether . . . there [is] a prope r
purpose for admitting other-acts evidence” under MRE
26
404(b)(2). Rock, 499 Mich at 259. “Only if the trial court find s
a proper purpose under MRE 404(b) should the trial court the n
apply MRE 403.” Rock, 499 Mich at 259.
“If necessary to determine the admissibility of evidence unde r
[MRE 404(b)], the court must require the defendant to state th e
theory or theories of defense, limited only by the defendant’s
privilege against self-incrimination.” MRE 404(b)(4). However,
a ruling on whether to admit MRE 404(b) evidence does no t
require an evidentiary hearing if no motion in limine was filed.
See People v Williamson, 205 Mich App 592, 596 (1994) (“the trial
court’s failure to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding th e
admissibility of the evidence [did] not require reversal ”
27
because neither People v Golochowicz, 413 Mich 298 (1982), no r
People v Engelman, 434 Mich 204 (1990), “mandates that a n
evidentiary hearing be held where, as in this case, no motion i n
limine has been made by the defense”).
28
A trial court may not circumvent MRE 404(b)(2) by taking
29
judicial notice of the respondent’s past conduct. In re
Kabanuk, 295 Mich App 252, 260 (2012). In Kabanuk, the tria l
court took judicial notice of the defendant’s past ba d
courtroom behavior, essentially finding that because he had
been disruptive at earlier hearings, he had likely bee n
disruptive in the matter before the court. Id. The Court of
Appeals found that the trial court’s consideration of th e
30
defendant’s prior acts violated MRE 404(b)(2), but concluded
the error was not outcome determinative and therefore, did no t
require reversal. Kabanuk, 295 Mich App at 260.

Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
A defendant accused of criminal sexual conduct may introduc e
testimony under MRE 404(b) to show that the complainant’s
father previously induced the complainant to make fals e
allegations of sexual abuse against other persons disliked b y
the father. People v Jackson, 477 Mich 1019 (2007) (“[s]uch
testimony does not implicate the rape shield statute”). See als o
People v Parks, 478 Mich 910 (2007), where the Court remanded
the case for an evidentiary hearing at which the defendant wa s
to be given “the opportunity to offer proof that th e
complainant made a prior false accusation of sexual abus e
against another person.”
“[T]here is no ‘res gestae exception’ to MRE 404(b), nor does
the definition of ‘res gestae’ set forth in [People v] Delgado[, 404
Mich 76 (1978),] and [People v] Sholl[, 453 Mich 730 (1996),]
delineate the limits of that rule’s applicability.” Jackson, 49 8
Mich at 268 n 9, 274, overruling any conflicting caselaw “[t] o
the extent that such caselaw holds that there is a ‘res gesta e
exception’ to MRE 404(b)[.]”
Other-acts evidence is admissible to rebut forensic cente r
staff’s testimony on the issue of a defendant’s sanity. See People
v McRunels, 237 Mich App 168, 183 (1999). “[T]he concerns tha t
underlie MRE 404[(b)] are not implicated where the challenge d
evidence is introduced on the issue of the defendant’s sanity,
and not in an attempt to have the jury convict of the crim e
charged on the basis of past misconduct[.]” McRunels, 237
Mich App at 183 (second alteration in original).
2. Notice Requirement in Criminal Case
The prosecutor must provide notice of other acts evidenc e
intended to be offered “at trial, so that the defendant has a fai r
opportunity to meet it[.]” MRE 404(b)(3)(A). The notice mus t
articulate “the permitted purpose for which the prosecuto r
intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that support s
31
the purpose[.]” MRE 404(b)(3)(B). The prosecutor mus t
provide the defendant with the notice “in writing at least 1 4
days before trial, unless the court, for good cause, excuse s
pretrial notice, in which case the notice may be submitted i n
any form.” MRE 404(b)(3)(C).
MRE 404 does not provide a definition of good cause.
However, “[a] trial court has broad discretion to determin e
what constitutes ‘good cause.’” Thomas M Cooley Law Sch v Do e
31 MRE 404(b)(2) mentions “proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, scheme, plan, or system i n
doing an act, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.”
Page 2-48 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
1, 300 Mich App 245, 264 (2013) (considered in context of a n
unrelated court rule). “[N]otice is not required when th e
evidence the prosecution intends to present falls within the re s
gestae exception to MRE 404(b).” People v Jackson, 498 Mich 246,
256 (2015) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).
The reasons for the notice requirement are: “(1) to force th e
prosecutor to identify and seek admission only of prior bad
acts evidence that passes the relevancy threshold, (2) to ensur e
that the defendant has an opportunity to object to and defen d
against this sort of evidence, and (3) to facilitate a thoughtfu l
ruling by the trial court that either admits or excludes thi s
evidence and is grounded in an adequate record.” People v
Hawkins, 245 Mich App 439, 454-455 (2001).
Where the prosecution fails to provide notice of its intent t o
32
offer other-acts evidence as required under MRE 404(b)(3),
the defendant is not entitled to relief unless he or sh e
“demonstrate[s] that this error ‘more probably tha n
not . . . was outcome determinative.’” Jackson, 498 Mich at 278 ,
281 (holding that where “the lack of proper pretrial notice di d
not result in the admission of substantively improper other-
acts evidence,” and where the defendant did not show “tha t
any . . . arguments [(against the admission of the other-act s
evidence)] would have been availing, or would have affected

failed to “demonstrate[] entitlement to relief based on th e
erroneous handling of [the MRE 404(b)] testimony”) (quotatio n
marks and citations omitted).
Where “‘written notice’ was not timel y
provided, . . . and . . . ‘oral notice on the record’ was no t
provided until one day before trial,” “the trial court erred b y
admitting [MRE 404(b)] evidence . . . [because] there was [no]
good cause to excuse the noncompliance.” People v Felton, 32 6
Mich App 412, 421 (2018). The prosecution’s claim that it did
not timely provide notice of its intent to present evidence o f
the defendant’s prior conviction because it did not know th e
prior bad act evidence existed “[held] no weight” because “i t
[was] undisputed that the prosecution was aware o f
defendant’s conviction . . . at the time the information wa s
filed.” Id. at 422. Further, “the prosecution’s claim that it did
not have the police report . . . until the day before it filed th e
notice required by MRE 404(b) [was] not adequate to show
good cause,” where the record demonstrated “no efforts wer e

made [to obtain the police report] during the six month s
between the filing of the information and defendant’s trial[.] ”
Felton, 326 Mich App at 422. Evidence that another witnes s
purchased drugs from the defendant days prior to the curren t
incident was also “procedurally inadmissible” because th e
prosecutor “failed to indicate that [the] testimony woul d
concern other acts.” Id. at 423-424 (“[i]t was only in response t o
[the defendant’s] objection that the prosecution explained th e
general content of [the] expected testimony”). The prosecutor’ s
argument that it did not know it would need the witness’ s
testimony until another witness took flight “carrie[d] littl e
weight given that no MRE 404(b) notice was ever filed fo r
[that] witness either.” Felton, 326 Mich App at 424. Under thes e
circumstances, “[i]t is clear that the late notice . . . did
‘unfair[ly] surprise’ defendant and did not provide him wit h
time to ‘marshal arguments regarding both relevancy an d
unfair prejudice.’” Id. at 421 (alteration in original).
Additionally, “the court improperly put the burden on th e
defendant to produce evidence [that admission of the MRE
404(b) evidence was improper], while it accepted th e
prosecutor’s statements–that were wholly unsupported by an y
evidence–as conclusive.” Felton, 326 Mich App at 424.
While failure to provide notice under MRE
33
404(b)(3) constitutes plain error, “it may be deemed harmles s
and therefore not grounds for reversal.” People v Lowrey, 342
Mich App 99, 117 (2022). In Lowrey, the defendant argued “tha t
the trial court erred by admitting evidence of prior domesti c
and sexual abuse between himself and the victim because o f
lack of notice.” Id. at 115. However, “defendant fail[ed] t o
articulate how he would have proceeded differently” o r
provide “any offer of proof to the effect that the victim’ s
testimony was untrue.” Id. at 118. Although “it was plain error
for [evidence of prior abuse] to be admitted without providin g
proper notice,” the Lowrey Court determined that the evidence
was relevant and “the probative value of this evidence wa s
[not] substantially outweighed by the danger of unfai r
prejudice.” Id. at 118, 119. Because defendant was unable t o
“demonstrate that any error was outcome-determinative,” th e
Court of Appeals concluded that he was “not entitled to relief. ”
Id. at 119.

3. VanderVliet Test
MRE 404(b) codifies the requirements set forth in People v
VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52 (1993). See MRE 404, Note to 199 4
Amendment. The admissibility of other-acts evidence unde r
MRE 404(b), except for modus operandi evidence used t o
34
prove identity, is generally governed by the test established
in VanderVliet, which is as follows:
• The evidence must be offered for a purpose other
than to show the propensity to commit a crime.
VanderVliet, 444 Mich at 74. Trial courts mus t
“vigilantly weed out character evidence that i s
disguised as something else.” People v Denson, 500
Mich 385, 400 (2017) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “[M]erely reciting a proper purpose doe s
not actually demonstrate the existence of a proper
purpose for the particular other-acts evidence at issue
and does not automatically render the evidence
admissible.” Id. “[I]n order to determine whether a n
articulated purpose is, in fact, merely a front for the
improper admission of other-acts evidence, the trial
court must closely scrutinize the logical relevance of
the evidence under the second prong of the
VanderVliet test.” Denson, 500 Mich at 400.
• The evidence must be relevant under MRE 402 to a n
issue or fact of consequence at trial. VanderVliet, 44 4
Mich at 74. “Other-acts evidence is logically relevan t
if two components are present: materiality and
probative value.” Denson, 500 Mich at 401. See Sectio n
2.2(A) for a detailed discussion of logical relevance.
• The trial court should determine whether the danger
of undue prejudice substantially outweighs the
probative value of the evidence under MRE 403, i n
view of the availability of other means of proof and
other appropriate facts. VanderVliet, 444 Mich at 74-75.
• Upon request, the trial court may provide a limiting
instruction35
under MRE 105, cautioning the jury t o
use the evidence only for its proper purpose and no t
to infer that a bad or criminal character caused the
defendant to commit the charged offense. VanderVliet,
444 Mich at 75.
34 See Section 2.4(A)(5)(e) for a discussion on how modus operandi evidence used to prove identity may b e
admissible.
35 The jury instruction is M Crim JI 4.11.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-51
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
The Supreme Court in VanderVliet characterized MRE 404(b) a s
a rule of inclusion rather than exclusion:
“There is no policy of general exclusion relating t o
other acts evidence. There is no rule limiting
admissibility to the specific exceptions set forth i n
[MRE] 404(b). Nor is there a rule requirin g
exclusion of other misconduct when the defendan t
interposes a general denial. Relevant other act s
evidence does not violate [MRE] 404(b) unless it is
offered solely to show the criminal propensity of
an individual to establish that he acted i n
conformity therewith.
* * *
“[MRE] 404(b) permits the judge to admit other
acts evidence whenever it is relevant on a
noncharacter theory.” VanderVliet, 444 Mich at 65.
The VanderVliet case underscores the following principles of
MRE 404(b):
• There is no presumption that other-acts evidence
should be excluded. VanderVliet, 444 Mich at 65.
• The rule’s list of “other purposes” for which evidence
may be admitted is not exclusive. Evidence may be
presented to show any fact relevant under MRE 402,
except criminal propensity. VanderVliet, 444 Mich at
65.
• A defendant’s general denial of the charges does no t
automatically prevent the prosecutor fro m
introducing other-acts evidence at trial. VanderVliet,
444 Mich at 78.
• MRE 404(b) imposes no heightened standard for
determining logical relevance or for weighing the
prejudicial effect versus the probative value of the
evidence. VanderVliet, 444 Mich at 68, 71-72.
If other-acts evidence is admissible for a proper purpose unde r
MRE 404(b), it should not be deemed inadmissible simply
because it also demonstrates criminal propensity. Se e
VanderVliet, 444 Mich at 65.
“In evaluating whether the prosecution has provided a n
intermediate inference other than an impermissible characte r
inference, [the court] examine[s] the similarity between a
defendant’s other act and the charged offense.” Denson, 50 0
Page 2-52 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
Mich at 402. “The degree of similarity that is required betwee n
a defendant’s other act and the charged offense depends on th e
manner in which the prosecution intends to use the other-act s
evidence.” Id. at 402-403. “If the prosecution creates a theory of
relevance based on the alleged similarity between a
defendant’s other act and the charged offense, [the Michiga n
Supreme Court] require[s] a ‘striking similarity’ between th e
two acts to find the other act admissible.” Id. at 403, quoting
VanderVliet, 444 Mich at 67. “When the prosecution’s theory of
relevancy is not based on the similarity between the other ac t
and the charged offense, a ‘striking similarity’ between the act s
is not required.” Denson, Mich at 403, quoting VanderVliet, 44 4
Mich at 67. “For example, when the theory of relevance of the
other-acts evidence is to identify the defendant as th e
perpetrator of the charged crime considering the uncommo n
or distinctive similarity of the facts and circumstances of bot h
the uncharged and charged offenses, there must be a hig h
degree–or striking–similarity so as to earmark the charged
offense as the handiwork of the accused, i.e., the defendant’ s
signature.” People v Galloway, 335 Mich App 629, 639 (2021)
(cleaned up). “[W]hen the other-acts evidence is offered t o
show intent, logical relevance dictates only that the charge d
crime and the proffered other acts are of the same general
category.” Id. at 640 (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Committee Tip:
Over the years, other acts evidence under MR E
404(b) has been referred to as ‘similar acts’
evidence. This nomenclature, although a
misnomer, is only partly so. The rule does not
use the word similar, but similarity may or may
not drive the relevancy and materiality
questions. Depending on the prosecutor’s stated
purpose for use of other acts evidence, and in
conjunction with the theory of the prosecution,
the stated purpose for admission may demand a
low degree of similarity (intent) or an
exceedingly high one (identity). This underscores
the need for judicial persistence in ensuring
precisely what purpose is advanced for
admission.
In cases where the evidence is admissible for one purpose bu t
not others, the trial court may, upon request, give a limitin g
instruction pursuant to MRE 105. People v Sabin (After Remand),
463 Mich 43, 56 (2000). The trial court has no duty to give a
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-53
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
limiting instruction sua sponte, though it should give a limiting
instruction even in the absence of a party’s request. People v
Chism, 390 Mich 104, 120-121 (1973).
The Michigan Supreme Court and Court of Appeals affirmed
the continued viability of VanderVliet’s analytical framework,
and its characterization of MRE 404(b) as a rule of inclusio n
rather than exclusion in Sabin (After Remand), 463 Mich at 55-
59, and in People v Katt, 248 Mich App 282, 304 (2001).
Although a panel of the Court of Appeals has said that court s
should conduct the VanderVliet analysis on the record, th e
court is not required to do so. See People v Vesnaugh, 128 Mic h
App 440, 448 (1983), citing People v Nabers, 103 Mich App 354,
366-367 (1981).
4. Golochowicz Test
Another test for admission of other-acts evidence results fro m
People v Golochowicz, 413 Mich 298, 309 (1982). Generally
36
speaking, the VanderVliet test has supplanted the Golochowicz
test. However, the Golochowicz test remains valid when th e
proponent of other-acts evidence seeks to show identificatio n
through modus operandi. People v VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52, 66
(1993); People v Ho, 231 Mich App 178, 186 (1998).
Before the other-acts evidence may be admitted pursuant t o
Golochowicz, “(1) there must be substantial evidence that the
defendant actually perpetrated the bad act sought to b e
introduced; (2) there must be some special quality o r
circumstance of the bad act tending to prove the defendant’ s
identity or the motive, intent, absence of mistake or accident,
scheme, plan or system in doing the act . . ., opportunity,
preparation and knowledge; (3) one or more of these factor s
must be material to the determination of the defendant’s guil t
of the charged offense; and (4) the probative value of th e
evidence sought to be introduced must not be substantiall y
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.” Golochowicz,
413 Mich at 309.
“[W]hen the theory of relevance of the other-acts evidence is t o
identify the defendant as the perpetrator of the charged crim e
considering the uncommon or distinctive similarity of the fact s
and circumstances of both the uncharged and charge d
offenses, there must be a high degree–or striking–similarity s o
as to earmark the charged offense as the handiwork of th e
36 People v VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52 (1993)
Page 2-54 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
accused, i.e., the defendant’s signature.” People v Galloway, 335
Mich App 629, 639 (2021) (quotation marks, alteration, and
citation omitted).
5. Other Purposes
a. Motive
Where the defendant was charged with killing the
decedent (a woman with whom he lived and had tw o
children in common) on the day their adult daughter
moved back into their home, evidence that the defendan t
sexually assaulted the daughter when she was five year s
old was admissible for the purpose of establishing the
defendant’s motive for killing the girlfriend. People v
Edwards, 328 Mich App 29, 32-33 (2019). In explainin g
how the other-acts evidence related to motive, the
prosecutor stated that (1) on the day of the murder, the
daughter moved into the decedent’s home (where the
defendant resided), (2) the defendant was angry at the
decedent’s decision to allow the daughter to move i n
because of the previous allegations of sexual assault and
because he was not allowed to live in the same home a s
the daughter, and (3) he directed his anger at the deceden t
by killing her. Id. at 42 (the reasons stated by th e
prosecutor were supported in the record where a
detective testified at the preliminary examination that the
defendant stated that he had argued with the deceden t
about the daughter moving in and that the argumen t
escalated to the point where the defendant shot the
decedent). Accordingly, admission of the previous sexual
assault of the defendant’s daughter was admissible under
MRE 404(b) for a proper purpose. Edwards, 328 Mich Ap p
at 43.
In People v Galloway, 335 Mich App 629, 635 (2021), the
prosecution argued that evidence of a prior assault wa s
admissible in defendant’s first-degree premeditated
murder case “for the proper purpose[] of showin g
motive[.]” The Galloway Court concluded that “the trial
court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of
defendant’s assault . . . under MRE 404(b) because ther e
[was] an insufficient factual nexus between the prior
conviction and the present charged offense to suppor t
any noncharacter theory of admission” where “[t]he
incidents did not share idiosyncratic or unexpected
conduct like the removal of clothing without sexual
assault,” and there was no evidence that the assaul t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-55
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
victim and murder victim “shared similar injurie s
because [the murder victim’s] body was never recovered.”
Galloway, 335 Mich App at 644-645 (quotation marks and
citation omitted; finding that “evidence of defendant’ s
assault . . . [was] only relevant to show his character or
propensity to commit the charged offense and therefore
[was] inadmissible”). Defendant’s charge of “first-degree
premeditated murder, and the fact that defendan t
assaulted [another victim did] not tend to establis h
defendant’s motive” and “there [was] no intermediate fac t
linking the charged acts and the previous convictions.” Id.
at 641. The prosecution’s assertion that the assault was a
“practice run” for the murder tended only “to establis h
defendant’s motive for attacking [the assault victim], no t
his motive . . . to kill [the murder victim].” Id.
b. Intent
“[A] defendant’s statements of general intent are not prior
acts under MRE 404(b).” People v Wisniewski, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2025) (noting “that such statements are
considered the statement of a party-opponent under MRE
801(d)(2)(a)”).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting
the prosecution “to admit evidence of a 2006 incident at a
7-Eleven in which defendant allegedly indicated that he
had a gun and that he would shoot the clerk if she did no t
hand over the money” during the defendant’s trial for a n
armed robbery of a Halo Burger where the defendan t
allegedly demanded all the money in the till while
holding his hand in his sweatshirt in a way that suggested
he had a weapon. People v Henry, 315 Mich App 130, 133,
141 (2016). The Court concluded that “[t]he evidence wa s
offered for a proper purpose and was highly relevant. I t
was not offered for the purpose of showing tha t
defendant was a bad person. Instead, it was offered t o
give context to the crime itself. Defendant’s behavior
demonstrated an intent to place his victims in fear that he
was armed with a dangerous weapon.” Id. at 142 (als o
concluding that the probative value of the evidence wa s
not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice, “especially in light of defendant’s claim that he
was not armed and that both [of the employees working
at Halo Burger on the night of the robbery] were
unreasonable in their fear that defendant was armed”).
In the defendant’s trial for fatally stabbing the victim, “the
trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting
Page 2-56 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
evidence of [the] defendant’s prior stabbing of the victim”
because the other-acts evidence was admitted “not t o
demonstrate criminal propensity, but to disprove
defendant’s claim that her decision to stab the victim wa s
emotional and made in self-defense, i.e., to prove her
intent[.]” People v Dixon-Bey, 321 Mich App 490, 517-519
(2017) (noting that, “much like a victim’s prior acts of
violence, a defendant’s prior acts of violence are als o
highly relevant as to whether a defendant was acting i n
self-defense”) (citation omitted).
In People v Galloway, 335 Mich App 629, 635 (2021), th e
prosecution argued that evidence of a prior assault wa s
admissible in defendant’s first-degree premeditated
murder case “for the proper purpose[] of showing
motive[.]” The Galloway Court concluded that “the trial
court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of
defendant’s assault . . . under MRE 404(b) because ther e
[was] an insufficient factual nexus between the prior
conviction and the present charged offense to suppor t
any noncharacter theory of admission” where “[t]he
incidents did not share idiosyncratic or unexpected
conduct like the removal of clothing without sexual
assault,” and there was no evidence that the assaul t
victim and murder victim “shared similar injurie s
because [the murder victim’s] body was never recovered.”
Galloway, 335 Mich App at 644-645 (quotation marks and
citation omitted; finding that “evidence of defendant’ s
assault . . . [was] only relevant to show his character or
propensity to commit the charged offense and therefore
[was] inadmissible”). Defendant’s charge of “first-degree
premeditated murder, and the fact that defendan t
assaulted [another victim did] not tend to establis h
defendant’s motive” and “there [was] no intermediate fac t
linking the charged acts and the previous convictions.” Id.
at 641. The prosecution’s assertion that the assault was a
“practice run” for the murder tended only “to establis h
defendant’s motive for attacking [the assault victim], no t
his motive . . . to kill [the murder victim].” Id.
c. Knowledge and Absence of Mistake or Accident
Where the prosecutor sought to establish the defendant’ s
intent and absence of mistake by introducing evidence
that other infants in the defendant’s care had suspiciou s
injuries, it was error for the trial court to prohibit the
evidence as impermissible character evidence under MRE
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-57
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
404(b). People v Martzke (On Remand), 251 Mich App 282,
292 (2002).
Where the defendant was charged with second-degree
murder and other offenses involving driving while
intoxicated, “prior acts evidence . . . involv[ing] incident s
in which defendant either drove unsafely, was passed ou t
in her vehicle, or was involved in an accident while
impaired or under the influence of prescriptio n
substances, or was in possession of pills” was admissible
37
under MRE 404(b)(2) “to show defendant’s knowledg e
and absence of mistake, and was relevant to the malice
element for second-degree murder because it wa s
probative of defendant’s knowledge of her inability t o
drive safely after consuming prescription substances.”
People v Bergman, 312 Mich App 471, 494 (2015). Further,
“because the prior incidents were minor in comparison t o
the charged offense involving a head-on collision tha t
caused the deaths of two individuals, the probative value
of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the
danger of unfair prejudice under MRE 403.” Bergman, 31 2
Mich App at 494 (additionally noting that “the trial cour t
gave an appropriate cautionary instruction to reduce any
potential for prejudice”).
d. Opportunity, Scheme, or Plan
The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting
testimony from other-acts witnesses describing a “patter n
of defendant using enticements (e.g., promises, jobs, or
money) to lure or recruit them to motels for purposes of
prostituting or sexually exploiting them and resorting t o
threats and violence if they refused” because “there were
sufficient similarities between the other incidents and the
charged offenses[.]” People v Thurmond, 348 Mich Ap p
715, 729, 730 (2023). “The testimony of the other-act s
witnesses” “was highly probative of defendant’s plan or
scheme to use these women for his own financial gain or
to satisfy his personal interests[.]” Id. at 729, 731 .
Considering “the trial court gave a cautionary
instruction,” “the probative value of the evidence was no t
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice.” Id. at 731, 732. The Court further held tha t
“[a]lthough [records extracted from two cell phone s
recovered from defendant at the time of his arrest did] no t

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
fall within the scope of the human-trafficking charge as
alleged in the information, the records were still highly
probative of defendant’s scheme or plan to prostitute
women and engage in human trafficking during the
relevant time period.” Id. at 732.
In People v Smith, 282 Mich App 191, 193 (2009), it wa s
alleged during defendant’s CSC trial that on tw o
occasions the defendant entered his 10 or 11-year-old
daughter’s bedroom, pulled down her pants and
underwear, and penetrated her vagina with his penis.
38
Under MRE 404(b)(2), the trial court admitte d
testimony from the victim’s stepsister that she lived wit h
the defendant when she was 11 or 12 years old, and tha t
the defendant exposed his penis to her on three occasion s
during that time. Smith, 282 Mich App at 193-194. The
Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant’s prior
acts of indecent exposure finding that the evidence wa s
offered for the proper purposes of showing opportunity,
scheme, or plan. Id. at 197 (also finding that while “[t]h e
evidence was damaging to defendant, . . . MRE 403 seek s
to avoid unfair prejudice, which was not shown here”).
Evidence of the defendant’s previous larcenies of
snowmobiles and a trailer, granite and bags of setting
materials, and three incidents of thefts from car
dealerships was properly admitted under MRE
39
404(b)(2) during defendant’s trial for charges stemmin g
from allegations that he broke into a car dealership and
stole paint and chemical hardeners because (1) it wa s
offered for the proper purpose of proving “that defendan t
had a common scheme or plan,” (2) it “was relevant i n
that it showed that defendant had the same scheme or
plan in the case at bar,” (3) it was sufficiently similar t o
the other incidents such that it made the evidence “highly
probative of a common scheme or plan,” and (4) “the trial
court provided a limiting instruction, which can hel p
alleviate any danger of unfair prejudice, given that juror s
are presumed to follow their instructions.” People v
Roscoe, 303 Mich App 633, 645-647 (2014) (the previou s
larcenies showed that the defendant had a commo n
scheme or plan of breaking into businesses and stealing

items that have a higher resale value when sold together
and that do not appear to be of much value to the average
person).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting
evidence of the defendant’s previous thefts during the
defendant’s trial for larceny and murder where the other-
acts evidence was admissible to show the existence of a
common plan, scheme, or system. People v Wood, 307 Mic h
App 485, 502-503 (2014), vacated in part on other ground s
40
498 Mich 914 (2015). Specifically, the trial court admitted
testimony regarding the defendant’s multiple thefts fro m
the shared home of two disabled women who had hired
the defendant to work around their house, the theft of hi s
77-year-old landlady’s purse from her home, and a thef t
from another home where the defendant was working.
Wood, 307 Mich App at 502-503. The evidence wa s
properly admitted because “[t]he bulk of the other
acts . . . shared several common features with the offense s
in the instant case.” Id. at 502. Specifically, the evidence
regarding the robbery of the two disabled wome n
“demonstrated that defendant targeted vulnerable
women . . . by offering to work around their home[s] ”
and later returned to their homes, intending to steal and
armed with a weapon. Id. at 502-503. In the instant case,
the defendant was alleged to have met the 80-year-old
female victim by offering to perform yard work before
returning to her home to commit larceny and murder
with a knife he was carrying. Id. at 503. Further, the Cour t
found that the evidence regarding the defendant’s thef t
from his landlady was another instance of the defendan t
“target[ing] a vulnerable and elderly woman for theft” by
41
entry into her home. Id.
The trial court did not abuse its discretion “in admittin g
evidence related to [previous Child Protective Service s
(CPS)] investigations involving allegations that [the father
of the defendant’s daughter] sexually abused hi s
daughter”; “the uncharged conduct . . . was logicall y
relevant under MRE 404(b) to show defendant’s common
plan, scheme, or system in using [her daughter] to make a
false allegation of sexual abuse against [her daughter’ s
40For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
41The Court also held that “the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the other acts evidence”
because the evidence was admitted for the purpose of “proving several elements of the offenses wit h
which defendant was charged.” Wood, 307 Mich App at 501.

father] . . . [and] was also relevant to show defendant’ s
motive for causing the false report to be made in the
instant case in that the false report could cause CPS t o
remove [her daughter] from [her daughter’s father’s]
care.” People v Mullins, 322 Mich App 151, 167, 169 (2017).
Additionally, “[b]ecause defendant was the party wh o
first pursued the substantive allegations involving the
[earlier CPS] petition,” she opened the door to the CP S
petition testimony even though “the prosecution never
noticed her of its intent to admit such evidence,” and
“any prejudice flowing from the evidence was of
defendant’s own making.” Id. at 170, 172.
In People v Galloway, 335 Mich App 629, ___ (2021), th e
prosecution sought to admit evidence of a prior assault i n
defendant’s first-degree premeditated murder case
arguing “that there were striking similarities in each case,
which demonstrated a common scheme, plan, or system.”
Id. at 635. “There must be such a concurrence of common
features that the charged acts and the other acts ar e
logically seen as part of a general plan, scheme, or
design.” Id. at 644 (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“A high degree of similarity is required–more than i s
needed to prove intent, but less than is required to prove
identity–but the plan itself need not be unusual or
distinctive.” Id. at 644-645 (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “[P]hysical similarities between [the tw o
victims] did not persuasively establish a common scheme
or plan.” Id. at 645.
e. Identity
Other-acts evidence regarding a prior attempted murder
was properly admitted in defendant’s first-degree murder
trial because it was relevant to “whether defendant [was]
the person who shot and killed the victim, then tried t o
dispose of her body using fire,” and it tended “to show
defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in committing the
charged offenses.” People v Bass, 317 Mich App 241, 260
(2016). There were significant factual similarities betwee n
the other-acts evidence and the circumstances in the
instant case, specifically: both victims were attacked fro m
behind, both victims were women the defendant knew for
a substantial time, the defendant had a sexual
relationship with both victims at the time of the offenses,
a liquid that smelled like gasoline was poured on the
victim during the attempted murder and gasoline wa s
used to burn the victim’s body in the instant case, and the
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-61
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
victim in the attempted murder case was wrapped “in a
carpet or something” and the victim’s body in the instan t
case “was found bound with wire atop a plastic tarp.” Id.
Further, while it was “a closer question whether the
probative value of [the other-acts] evidence wa s
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice,” the defendant’s identity was a primary issue
at the trial; thus, “the similarities between his assaul t
against [the attempted murder victim] and the fact s
known about the victim’s death had a heightened
probative value.” Id. at 261. Accordingly, “[t]he decisio n
to admit the attempted-murder evidence fell within the
range of reasonable and principled outcomes.” Id.
In People v Galloway, 335 Mich App 629, 635 (2021), the
prosecution argued that evidence of a prior assault wa s
admissible in defendant’s first-degree premeditated
murder case “to identify defendant as [the victim’s]
killer.” Although there was substantial evidence tha t
defendant committed the assault because he pleaded
guilty to doing so, “the prosecution . . . failed to identif y
some special quality of the act that tend[ed] to prove
defendant’s identity”; “the two cases . . . [did] not show
similar degrees or characteristics of preparation,” and
“[t]he prosecution [did] not explain how the specific fact s
of each case [gave] rise to recognizable shared elements of
stalking behavior or isolation and asportation of the
victim.” Id. at 642-644 (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted; finding the evidence insufficient to prove
42
defendant’s identity under Golowchowicz ).
6. Error in the Admission of Other-Acts Evidence
Other-acts evidence is not logically relevant to prove a
common plan or scheme where is it “undisputed that th e
alleged offense occurred.” People v Heath, ___ Mich ___, ___
(2022). Indeed, “evidence of similar misconduct is logicall y
relevant to show that the charged act occurred where th e
uncharged misconduct and the charged offense are sufficientl y
similar to support an inference that they are manifestations of a
common plan, scheme, or system[.]” Id. at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted).
Improper admission of other-acts evidence “is presumed not t o
be a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears that,
more probably than not, it was outcome determinative—i.e.,
42People v Golochowicz, 413 Mich 298 (1982). See Section 2.4(A)(4) for more information on Golochowicz.

43
that it undermined the reliability of the verdict.” People v
Denson, 500 Mich 385, 409 (2017) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). Courts should “focus on the nature of the error an d
assess its effect in light of the weight and strength of th e
untainted evidence.” Id. at 409-410 (alterations, quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “[W]hether admission of other-
acts evidence is harmless is a case-specific inquiry; the effect o f
an error should be determined by the particularities of a n
individual case.” Id. at 413 n 15.
In the defendant’s trial for assaulting a teenager who wa s
dating his daughter, evidence of the defendant’s prio r
conviction for assaulting an unrelated individual in a n
unrelated incident involving a drug debt “was [not] admissibl e
under MRE 404(b) to rebut defendant’s claims of self-defens e
and defense of others”; “the trial court erred when it admitte d
defendant’s prior act because the prosecution failed to establis h
that it was logically relevant to a proper noncharacte r
purpose” and relied upon the other-acts evidence to “evoke[]
the very propensity inference that MRE 404(b) forbids.”
Denson, 500 Mich at 389, 411. During trial, the prosecutio n
questioned several witnesses about the defendant’s prio r
violent acts and “further compounded the problem” b y
arguing in closing that the defendant “did not act in ‘defense o f
anybody’ because [he] was a ‘bully’ and a ‘coward’ who los t
control with [the victim], just as he had lost control with [ a
prior victim, and . . . ] it was ‘not a coincidence’ that ‘[th e
defendant] pounded on [the victim in this case].’” Id. at 411-
412. The prosecutor asserted that “[b]ecause there was n o
viable self-defense claim in the [prior] incident, . . . there could
be no viable self-defense claim [in the current case].” Id. at 412.
Additionally, the defendant and the victim testified to “highly
conflicting accounts of the same incident, but the introductio n
of the inadmissible evidence tipped the scales, buoying [th e
victim’s] credibility while helping to sink defendant’s.” Id. a t
410, 413 (noting that the “defendant’s version of events was no t
wholly inconsistent with the injuries [the victim] sustained”).
Accordingly, “the improper admission of the other-act s
evidence undermined the reliability of the verdict by making i t
more probable than not that, had this evidence not bee n
admitted, the result of the proceedings would have bee n
different.” Id at 412-413 (“[a]lthough the prosecution als o
introduced photographs and medical testimony regarding [th e
victim’s] injuries, the mere presence of some corroboratin g
evidence does not automatically render an error harmless”;
43Harmless-error review is applied to all preserved nonconstitutional error. See People v Denson, 500 Mich
385, 409 (2017).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-63
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“[o]therwise, [the Court’s] directive to assess the effect of th e
error ‘in light of the weight and strength of the untainted
evidence’ would have no meaning”).
In Denson, “the prosecution built a theory of relevance centered
upon the supposed similarity between the [prior] incident and
the charged offense to rebut defendant’s claims of self-defens e
and defense of others”; “[c]onsequently, . . . the prosecutio n
[was required to] show ‘striking similarity’ between the othe r
act and the charged offense.” Denson, 500 Mich at 406, quoting
People v VanderVliet, 444 Mich 52, 67 (1993). However, “the
circumstances of the prior conviction did not bear a strikin g
similarity to those of the charged offense. Instead, th e
prosecution relied on the impermissible inference tha t
defendant had committed the charged offense because of hi s
supposed violent character.” Denson, 500 Mich at 408 (notin g
that “although the prosecution nominally recited what could
be a proper purpose under the first prong of the VanderVliet
test, evaluation of the probative value of the other-act s
evidence under the second prong of the VanderVliet tes t
reveal[ed] that no such purpose actually existed”).
Where a defendant was charged with sexually abusing hi s
daughter, the trial court erred in admitting evidence of th e
defendant’s alleged sexual misconduct involving a coworker,
because “the workplace acts and their contextual
circumstances [were] not remotely similar to the charged
conduct and [did] not support any inference that defendant’ s
charged conduct was part of a common plan.” People v Pattison,
276 Mich App 613, 617 (2007). In Pattison, the defendant wa s
charged with four counts of first-degree criminal sexua l
conduct for the alleged sexual abuse of his minor daughter tha t
occurred repeatedly over two years while she lived with him.
Id. at 615. However, the alleged sexual misconduct toward th e
defendant’s coworker was not admissible because there was n o
evidence of a “personal or familial relationship” between th e
defendant and his coworker. Id. at 616-617. Furthermore, th e
workplace incident involved “surprise, ambush, and force” o f
a grown woman, while the defendant’s conduct toward hi s
daughter involved “manipulation and abuse of parenta l
authority” of a child. Id.
“[T]he similarity of the drugs sold, unless of some unusual o r
unique type, [does not constitute] a common scheme fo r
purposes of MRE 404(b).” People v Felton, 326 Mich App 412,
430 (2018). In Felton, the defendant was charged with
possession with intent to deliver cocaine and heroin, and th e
trial court erred in admitting evidence that the defendan t
previously sold similar types of drugs (crack cocaine) to a n
Page 2-64 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
undercover detective because “heroin and cocaine are neithe r
unique nor unusual street drugs, nor are they in fact, as th e
prosecutor repeatedly represented to the jury, ‘the same.’” Id.
The prosecution intended to introduce evidence of a prio r
incident where the defendant “[w]as in possession of heroin, ”
“[w]as selling it to other individuals,” and “[u]tilized a
separate individual and their vehicle to drive him around and
assist him with the sale of illegal drugs” (i.e. a common plan o r
scheme). Id. at 426-427 (quotation marks omitted). Being i n
possession of heroin and selling it to others were “clearl y
insufficient” reasons to satisfy the requirements of MRE 404(b)
because “they amount[ed] to nothing more than propensit y
evidence[.]” Felton, 326 Mich App at 427. In addition, th e
prosecution never established its third reason (utilizing a
separate individual/vehicle) because the prior incident wa s
inconsistent with the actions in the instant case. Id. at 427-42 8
(“[t]here was no evidence that the driver [in the prior incident ]
was involved in recruiting buyers or doing anything other tha n
driving” unlike the situation in the instant case; in the prio r
incident, the defendant possessed the drugs and admitted the y
were his, unlike the situation in the instant case). “The mer e
fact that defendant possessed drugs in a vehicle driven b y
someone else is not sufficient to establish a common plan o r
scheme.” Id. at 427.
Evidence that defendant sold drugs to another witness (a fe w
days prior to the current incident) also failed to demonstrate a
common scheme or plan, notably because there was no vehicl e
involved and defendant possessed the drugs and sold them t o
the witness directly. Felton, 326 Mich App at 428.
The trial court erred by treating other-acts testimony agains t
the defendant during his trial for first-degree murder an d
mutilation of a human body “as if it involved just one prior
bad act,” where the testimony conceptually involved “tw o
distinct prior bad acts: attempted murder and rape.” People v
Bass, 317 Mich App 241, 259-260 (2016). The trial court abused
its discretion by admitting the sexual assault other-act s
evidence because it lacked logical relevance to the facts of th e
instant case; however, the attempted murder other-act s
evidence was properly admitted to show identity and th e
defendant’s scheme, plan, or system. Id. at 260-262. The sexual
assault other-acts evidence was not relevant to any fact i n
consequence where the defendant was not charged wit h
criminal sexual conduct, and there was no evidence that th e
victim was ever sexually assaulted; accordingly, “the onl y
logical purpose for the introduction of the sexual-assaul t
evidence was the improper character purpose, i.e., proof tha t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-65
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
defendant is a bad person and therefore probably committe d
the charged offenses.” Id. at 261. Further, the danger of unfai r
prejudice under MRE 403 outweighed any marginal probativ e
value that might exist because “[s]ex offenders are a loathed
class,” and “knowledge that defendant is a rapist did nothin g
to help the jurors decide whether he committed the charged
offenses.” Bass, 317 Mich App at 262 (concluding that reversal
was unwarranted because the defendant failed to meet hi s
burden of demonstrating that the erroneous admission o f
evidence more probably than not resulted in a miscarriage o f
justice where there was “overwhelming” circumstantia l
evidence of the defendant’s guilt and the trial court gave a
limiting instruction proscribing the jurors from considering th e
evidence for improper character purposes).
The trial court abused its discretion by admitting testimon y
from the defendant’s first wife about the defendant’s domesti c
abuse that occurred at least 16 years before the charged offens e
under MRE 404(b), “because the purpose of the evidence was
to show that in this case, defendant acted in conformity wit h
the character shown in the prior acts, i.e., that defendant wa s
threatening, abusive, and violent.” People v Rosa, 322 Mich Ap p
726, 735 (2018) (also finding that the evidence was inadmissibl e
44
under MCL 768.27b because it was not “uniquely probative”
or “needed to ensure that the jury was not misled”). Th e
defendant’s first wife’s testimony “did not offer probativ e
evidence on a material issue,” where it did not demonstrate a
particular pattern or scheme that would serve to identify th e
defendant and “[t]estimony about defendant’s abusiv e
treatment of his first wife many years ago” did not provid e
information “about whether defendant had an intent to kil l
when he strangled [the victim in the current case].” Id. at 735-
736 (concluding that compared to the highly probativ e
evidence offered by the victim and the defendant’s son,
evidence about “16-year-old assaults against a different perso n
are barely probative of intent, if at all” and “would not surviv e
review under MRE 403”). Notwithstanding, the court foun d
the error harmless because “exclusion of the testimony o f
defendant’s first wife would not have spared defendant fro m
the devastating propensity evidence that was properl y
admitted.” Rosa, 322 Mich App at 738.
The trial court abused its discretion by allowing the prosecuto r
to introduce defendant’s prior convictions through a defens e
witness for purposes of impeaching the witness b y
contradiction where “the prosecutor’s initial questions wer e
44See Section 2.4(C) for discussion of MCL 768.27b.
Page 2-66 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
not logically relevant to a proper purpose under MRE 404(b)
because they were not designed to elicit an answe r
contradicting any statements made by the witness on direc t
examination.” People v Wilder, 502 Mich 57, 65 (2018). In Wilder,
“the witness’s direct testimony was limited to whethe r
defendant owned a gun or possessed one on the date i n
question,” and the prosecutor repeatedly asked the witnes s
about the defendant’s two prior convictions and whether th e
witness knew of the defendant “to more generally carr y
weapons.” Id. (the Court noted that the witness’s “testimony
would not have been contradicted even if the witness ha d
acknowledged ‘know[ing] of’ defendant to more generall y
carry weapons”). The Court concluded that the prosecutor’ s
questions were not logically relevant to a proper purpos e
under MRE 404(b); they “were simply an attempt to elici t
propensity evidence.” Wilder, 502 Mich at 66 (also concluding
that this evidence was not permissible as character evidenc e
under MRE 404(a) and remanding to the trial court t o
determine whether the error in admitting the evidence wa s
harmless).
“Because the trial court erred in concluding defense counsel
opened the door, the trial court likewise erred in failing t o
analyze the admissibility of [defendant’s] prior acts.” People v
Plomb, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (concluding that “asking a
[confidential informant], who has a history o f
methamphetamine use and possession and who becam e
known to the police for the same, how they are familiar wit h
methamphetamine is not opening the door to questions o n
prior bad acts of the defendant”). In Plomb, “had the trial
prosecutor properly filed an other-acts notice and requested
their admission, [defendant’s] prior bad acts would have been
admissible as a common plan or scheme [under MRE 404(b)].”
Plomb, ___ Mich App at ___. “The prosecutor did not provid e
that requisite notice, however, and the court—likely due to it s
erroneous conclusion that defense counsel opened the door t o
the evidence—did not account for that failure.” Id. at ___.
“Furthermore, the court failed to complete a full MRE 403
balancing test.” Plomb, ___ Mich App at ___. “[T]he trial court’ s
failure to complete this assessment, or failure to accuratel y
complete this assessment, [was] a procedural failure by th e
trial court.” Id. at ___. “While it was error to admit the other
acts evidence, the question is whether absent the improperl y
admitted evidence, it is more probable than not that a differen t
outcome would have resulted.” Id. at ___. “This case was an
uncomplicated application of mostly uncontested facts to la w
and it rose and fell on the credibility of the [confidential
informant], on which [defendant’s] prior bad acts ha[d] little
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-67
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
bearing.” Id. at ___ (holding that defendant “failed to show
that the erroneous admission of his prior bad acts was worth y
of relief”).
7. Error in the Exclusion of Other-Acts Evidence
The trial court abused its discretion by excluding, at th e
defendant’s trial for charges arising from a sexual assault,
evidence of seven other instances of alleged criminal sexual
conduct by the defendant that did not result in convictions;
“the trial court neglected a fundamental responsibility in it s
MRE 404(b) evidentiary analysis, and . . . therefore abused it s
discretion by excluding the proposed testimony” withou t
considering whether the evidence was offered for a prope r
purpose or its legal relevance. People v Kelly, 317 Mich App 637,
647-648 (2016). “Without considering the evidence’s lega l
relevance for a proper purpose, the trial court could no t
conclude that the evidence’s probative value was substantiall y
outweighed by unfair prejudice or any of the other concern s
identified in MRE 403,” resulting in a failure “to follow th e
45
proper legal framework[.]” Kelly, 317 Mich App 647. Further,
“the trial court . . . abdicated the necessary relevancy analysi s
on the basis of impermissible credibility concerns” by allowin g
the “defendant’s protestations of ‘consent’ in respect to th e
other acts to control the MRE 404(b) analysis.” Kelly, 317 Mich
App at 645. “[T]here [was] considerable evidence that th e
sexual acts in question occurred and that defendant was th e
actor”; “[t]he only issue [was] whether that conduct wa s
consensual as claimed by defendant or constituted criminal
sexual conduct as asserted by the alleged victims, . . . and th e
trial court should not have dismissed the evidence . . . merely
because there was a credibility dispute.” Id. at 645-646.
Where the prosecutor sought to establish the defendant’s inten t
and absence of mistake by introducing evidence that othe r
infants in the defendant’s care had suspicious injuries, it wa s
error for the trial court to prohibit the evidence a s
impermissible character evidence under MRE 404(b). People v
Martzke (On Remand), 251 Mich App 282, 292 (2002).
Where the defendant was charged with second-degree murder,
operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a
controlled substance causing death, and operating with a
suspended license causing death, the defendant’s offer t o
stipulate that she had a suspended license did not render th e
prior acts evidence inadmissible under Old Chief v Unite d
45See Section 2.2(C) for a discussion of the MRE 403 balancing test.

46
States, 519 US 172 (1997). People v Bergman, 312 Mich App 471 ,
495-496 (2015) (holding that “the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion by admitting” the prior acts evidence because th e
“defendant’s offer to stipulate that she had a suspended
license, while being conclusive of a necessary element for tha t
offense, would not have been conclusive of or a sufficien t
substitute for the malice element of second-degree murder, fo r
which the evidence was offered”).
B. Certain Offenses Against Minors–§ 768.27a
“Notwithstanding [MCL 768.27], in a criminal case in which the
defendant is accused of committing a listed offense against a minor,
evidence that the defendant committed another listed offense
against a minor is admissible and may be considered for its bearing
on any matter to which it is relevant.” MCL 768.27a.
“[T]he language in MCL 768.27a allowing admission of another
listed offense ‘for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant’
permits the use of evidence to show a defendant’s character and
propensity to commit the charged crime, precisely that which MRE
404(b) precludes.” People v Watkins (Watkins II), 491 Mich 450, 470
(2012). Because MCL 768.27a “‘does not principally regulate th e
operation or administration of the courts,’” it is a substantive rule of
evidence and prevails over MRE 404(b). People v Watkins (Watkins I),
277 Mich App 358, 363-364 (2008), aff’d 491 Mich 450 (2012), quoting
People v Pattison, 276 Mich App 613, 619 (2007). “MCL 768.27a doe s
not run afoul of [separation-of-powers principles], and in cases i n
which the statute applies, it supersedes MRE 404(b).” Watkins II, 491
Mich at 476-477.
“[W]hile MCL 768.27a prevails over MRE 404(b) as to evidence tha t
falls within the statute’s scope, the statute does not mandate the
admission of all such evidence, but rather ‘the Legislature
necessarily contemplated that evidence admissible under the statute
need not be considered in all cases and that whether and whic h
evidence would be considered would be a matter of judicial
discretion, as guided by the [non-MRE 404(b)] rules of evidence,’
including MRE 403 and the ‘other ordinary rules of evidence, suc h
as those pertaining to hearsay and privilege[.]’” People v Uribe, 49 9
Mich 921, 922 (2016), quoting Watkins II, 491 Mich at 484-485.
46“In Old Chief, the United States Supreme Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in rejectin g
the defendant’s offer to stipulate that he had a prior felony conviction, a necessary element of the charge d
offense of felon in possession of a firearm.” People v Bergman, 312 Mich App 471, 494 (2015). The Ol d
Chief Court explained that “‘evidence of the name or nature of the prior offense generally carries a risk of
unfair prejudice to the defendant,’ and that the defendant’s admission of a prior conviction was not onl y
sufficient to prove that element of the charged offense, but also was ‘seemingly conclusive evidence of th e
element.’” Bergman, 312 Mich App at 494-495, quoting Old Chief, 519 US at 185-186.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-69
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“[E]vidence otherwise admissible under MCL 768.27a may not b e
excluded under MRE 403 as overly prejudicial simply because a
propensity inference is drawn.” People v Wisniewski, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2025). While evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a
remains subject to MRE 403, “courts must weigh the propensity
inference in favor of the evidence’s probative value rather than it s
prejudicial effect.” Watkins II, 491 Mich at 496. “There are several
considerations that may lead a court to exclude such evidence.”
Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). When deciding whether MRE 403 requires exclusion of
other-acts evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a, a court’ s
considerations may include:
“(1) the dissimilarity between the other acts and th e
charged crime, (2) the temporal proximity of the othe r
acts to the charged crime, (3) the infrequency of th e
other acts, (4) the presence of intervening acts, (5) th e
lack of reliability of the evidence supporting th e
occurrence of the other acts, and (6) the lack of need fo r
evidence beyond the complainant’s and the defendant’ s
testimony.” Watkins II, 491 Mich at 487-488. See als o
Uribe, 499 Mich at 922.
“This list of considerations is meant to be illustrative rather tha n
exhaustive.” Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___, quoting Watkins II,
491 Mich at 488. “[T]hese factors offer tools to facilitate, not a
standard to supplant, a trial court’s MRE 403 analysis.” Wisniewski,
___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “There
is no indication from Watkins that these factors must be discussed o n
the record.” People v Hoskins, 342 Mich App 194, 203 (2022) (noting,
however, that “the trial court cited Watkins on the record, stated tha t
it had considered the Watkins factors, and referenced a number o f
these factors in support of its decision to deny [defendant’s] motion”
to exclude evidence; defendant “failed to persuasively show that the
trial court’s analysis was legally deficient” where the “trial cour t
also cited MRE 403 and discussed its application to evidenc e
admissible under ML 768.27a”).
A court may also “consider whether charges were filed or a
conviction rendered when weighing the evidence under MRE 403. ”
Watkins II, 491 Mich at 489.
“The list of considerations in Watkins provides a tool to facilitate,
not a standard to supplant, [the] proper MRE 403 analysis, and i t
remains the court’s ‘responsibility’ to carry out such an analysis i n
determining whether to exclude MCL 768.27a evidence under tha t
rule.” Uribe, 499 Mich at 922 (quotation marks and citation omitted).
The trial court abused its discretion by excluding MCL 768.27a
evidence where it failed to conduct an MRE 403 analysis and instea d
Page 2-70 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
focused only on the considerations listed in Watkins II. Uribe, 49 9
Mich at 922. “In ruling the proposed testimony inadmissible under
MRE 403, the trial court, citing the illustrative list of consideration s
in Watkins, expressed concern regarding apparent inconsistencie s
between the proposed testimony and prior statements made by the
witness, and certain dissimilarities between the other act and the
charged offenses,” but “failed to explain . . . how or why thes e
concerns were sufficient . . . to render the ‘probative value [of the
proposed testimony] . . . substantially outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or
by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needles s
presentation of cumulative evidence,’ as required for exclusio n
under MRE 403.” Uribe, 499 Mich at 922 (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
MCL 768.27a “is applicable in juvenile-delinquency trials” becaus e
the statute “embodies substantive policy considerations regarding
criminal law, and there is no provision in the juvenile code or
juvenile court rules that conflicts with or parallels MCL 768.27a.” I n
re Kerr, 323 Mich App 407, 414-415 (2018) (citation omitted) (holding
that the trial court erred by concluding that MCL 768.27a did no t
apply to juvenile-delinquency trials, the Court “vacate[d] the trial
court’s order excluding the other-acts evidence and direct[ed] the
trial court to make its MRE 403 determination in accordance wit h
the principles set forth in Watkins, 491 Mich at 486-490”). See th e
Michigan Judicial Institute’s Juvenile Justice Benchbook, Chapter 9, fo r
information on the rules of evidence and standard of proof
applicable in a delinquency trial.
In People v Pattison, 276 Mich App 613, 619 (2007), the Court found
that MCL 768.27a did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause becaus e
admission of propensity evidence occurring before the statute’ s
effective date “[did] not lower the quantum of proof or value of the
evidence needed to convict a defendant.”
In order to conform to the Legislature’s intent in enacting MCL
768.27a “to extend safeguards for the protection of children agains t
sexual predators,” the statute should be used as a rule of inclusion,
not exclusion. People v Smith, 282 Mich App 191, 205 (2009).
Although it is unnecessary to consider MCL 768.27a when evidenc e
is deemed admissible under MCL 768.27 or MRE 404(b), “the prope r
analysis chronologically is to begin with MCL 768.27a when
addressing other-acts evidence that can be categorized as involving
a sexual offense against a minor and make a determination whether
‘listed offenses’ are at issue relative to the crime charged and the
acts sought to be admitted.” Smith, 282 Mich App at 205. I n
examining the admissibility of an offense committed against a
minor, the Smith Court offered the following guidance:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-71
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“Where listed offenses are at issue, the analysis begin s
and ends with MCL 768.27a. If listed offenses are not a t
issue, even where an uncharged offense may genuinel y
constitute an offense committed against a minor tha t
was sexual in nature, MCL 768.27a is not implicated, bu t
this is not to say that evidence of the offense i s
inadmissible. We do not construe MCL 768.27a as
suggesting that evidence of an uncharged sexual offens e
committed against a minor is inadmissible if the offens e
does not constitute a listed offense. Rather, the analysi s
simply turns to MRE 404(b) to decipher admissibility.
Only where the evidence does not fall under th e
umbrella of MCL 768.27a, nor is otherwise admissibl e
under MRE 404(b), should the court exclude th e
evidence.” Smith, 282 Mich App at 205-206.
See M Crim JI 20.28a for an instruction on Evidence of Other Acts o f
Child Sexual Abuse.
A “defendant [is] not deprived of his rights to due process or a fair
trial [where] severance of the multiple counts of [criminal sexual
conduct is] not required under MCR 6.120” because “even if
defendant’s multiple charges had been severed and tried at multiple
trials, the prosecution could have introduced the other-act s
evidence under MRE 404(b) or MCL 768.27a at each of his
hypothetical trials.” Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___. “Joinder o f
offenses under MCR 6.120 is appropriate if the offenses are
related”—“offenses are related if they comprise either the same
conduct or a series of connected acts or acts constituting part of a
single scheme of plan.” Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned
up). In Wisniewski, defendant was charged with four counts of first-
degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC-I) and two counts of second-
degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC-II) for his actions involving
four young girls. Id. at ___. After he was convicted on five of the si x
counts, defendant argued on appeal that “he was deprived of hi s
rights to due process or a fair trial because there should have bee n
severance of the multiple counts of CSC-I and CSC-II pursuant t o
MCR 6.120.” Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___. However, “[a]ll six o f
the CSC charges that were joined at trial were closely related to eac h
other” “to the extent that they involved a series of connected act s
amounting to parts of a single scheme or plan.” Id. at ___.
“Defendant’s specific method of sexually abusing [two of] the
girls . . . was similar, in that he would, while being in close physical
proximity to them, put his hands in their pants and touch their
genitals,” and “the common themes underlying defendant’s scheme
and plan to sexually exploit them were almost identical with each of
the victims.” Id. at ___ (noting that the sexual abuse “began when
the girls were very young” and “exploited personal relationships of
Page 2-72 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
trust”). “[W]ith this pattern of behavior, defendant fail[ed] t o
demonstrate . . . that the four counts of CSC-I and two counts of
CSC-II should not have been joined at trial.” Id. at ___ (rejectin g
defendant’s argument that “the volume of evidence leading to hi s
convictions,” including “the number of complainants who testified
against him, and the number of counts joined at trial[,] combined t o
rise to a level of extreme prejudice requiring a new trial”). “Because
there was not any impermissible misjoinder under MCR 6.120,
defendant also [was] unable to establish a constitutional violation,
either in the way of the deprivation of his right to a fair trial, or a
violation of due process.” Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___.
1. Notice Requirement
MCL 768.27a requires the prosecuting attorney to disclose
evidence admissible under the statute to the defendant “a t
least 15 days before the scheduled date of trial or at a later tim e
as allowed by the court for good cause shown, including th e
statements of witnesses or a summary of the substance of an y
testimony that is expected to be offered.”
The notice provision of MCL 768.27a(1) “only requires th e
prosecutor ‘to disclose the evidence to the defendant at least 1 5
days’ before trial.” People v Wisniewski, ___ Mich App ___, ___
(2025) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In Wisniewski,
“the prosecution complied with its statutory obligation [under
MCL 768.27a(1)] to provide a summary of the substance of [th e
witness’s] testimony that it expected to offer at trial” becaus e
the witness “testified at the preliminary examination,
and . . . defense counsel had an opportunity to perform a cross-
examination after listening to her direct examination. ”
Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___ (“Further, because [the
witness] was identified by the prosecution as a witness abou t
four months before trial, defendant certainly had notice tha t
she would be testifying in the first instance.”). “[T]he statutor y
language of MCL 768.27a does not expressly require formal
written notice, and because defense counsel had
acknowledged on the record that he had received the relevan t
evidence, as well as informal notice, from the prosecution, an y
notice challenge was not persuasive.” Wisniewski, ___ Mic h
App at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
2. Examples of Application
Evidence that the defendant previously committed the crim e
of attempted CSC-I against another minor was deemed
admissible for any relevant reason under MCL 768.27a at the
defendant’s subsequent trial for criminal sexual conduct wit h
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-73
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
two other minors. People v Mann, 288 Mich App 114, 118 (2010).
In Mann, “[t]he challenged evidence was relevant because i t
tended to show that it was more probable than not that the tw o
minors in [the current] case were telling the truth when the y
indicated that [the defendant] had committed CSC offense s
against them.” Id. In addition, the evidence tended to make th e
likelihood of the defendant’s behavior in the current case mor e
probable. Id. Finally, “the probative value of the evidence wa s
not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfai r
prejudice” because whether the victims were telling the trut h
was significantly probative of whether the defendant shoul d
be convicted. Id.
“[E]vidence otherwise admissible under MCL 768.27a may no t
be excluded under MRE 403 as overly prejudicial simpl y
because a propensity inference is drawn.” People v Wisniewski,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). In Wisniewski, the defendan t
argued “that the trial court plainly erred by admittin g
evidence of other acts of sexual misconduct that he committe d
against [a witness when she was younger] as the probativ e
value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by it s
prejudicial effect under MRE 403”; specifically, “defendan t
assert[ed] that [the witness’s] testimony should have bee n
excluded because of (1) the dissimilarity between the other-act s
evidence and the charged crimes, (2) the lack of temporal
proximity of the other-acts evidence to the charged crimes, (3)
the infrequency of the other acts committed against [th e
witness], and (4) the lack of need for [the witness’s] testimon y
given the ample testimony given by [three of the victims].” Id.
at ___. However, the witness’s “testimony was highl y
probative because of the propensity inference, and it als o
buttressed the credibility of [three of the victims and anothe r
witness], each of whom recounted details of defendant’s sexual
abuse or what he had said about his sexual interest i n
prepubescent girls.” Id. at ___. “More significantly, [the
witness’s] account of what happened the evening tha t
defendant sexually assaulted her was almost identical to wha t
[two of the victims] had encountered, with defendant using th e
opportunity of being in close physical proximity to the girls t o
perpetrate the sexual abuse, and doing so even though other s
were present in the room.” Id. at ___. Although “the evidenc e
that defendant previously committed a sexual assault agains t
[the witness] was prejudicial because it could demonstrate tha t
defendant committed the charged crimes,” “the evidence wa s
not unfairly prejudicial under MRE 403 because the evidence’ s
propensity inferences weigh in favor of the evidence’ s
probative value, as opposed to its prejudicial effect. ”
Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
Page 2-74 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
omitted) (concluding that this witness’s testimony “wa s
supportive of the credibility of the multiple victims’ testimon y
at trial” and “provided the jury with a more complete pictur e
of defendant’s history, particularly regarding his sexual
interest in young girls”). Additionally, the trial court’s jur y
instruction—which provided, in part, “You must not convict the
defendant here solely because you think he is guilty of other ba d
conduct”—”had the effect of minimizing the danger of unfai r
prejudice because the trial court instructed [the jury] of the
appropriate use of other-acts evidence.” Id. at ___ (holding tha t
“any danger of unfair prejudice was alleviated because juror s
are presumed to follow their instructions”) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). Therefore, “the trial court did not plainl y
err by admitting [the witness’s] testimony under MRE 403 o r
MCL 768.27a.” Wisniewski, ___ Mich App at ___.
In People v Buie (On Remand), 298 Mich App 50, 72-73 (2012),
the defendant was charged with first-degree criminal sexual
conduct and had previously been convicted of sexuall y
assaulting a 13-year-old. The testimony of the previous victi m
indicated that the manner in which the sexual assault s
occurred in both instances was similar, the subject crime s
occurred within three years of each other, and the evidence o f
each crime was supported by DNA evidence establishing tha t
the defendant was the offender. Id. at 73. The Court noted tha t
“[a]lthough the evidence was highly prejudicial, it was als o
highly probative of defendant’s propensity for sexuall y
assaulting young girls.” Id. Accordingly, the defendant failed
to “demonstrate[] that the probative value of the evidence wa s
substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice, ”
and “[t]he trial court did not abuse its discretion by admittin g
[the] evidence under MCL 768.27a.” Buie (On Remand), 298
Mich App at 73.
Where the defendant was on trial for various counts o f
criminal sexual conduct against a child who was almost 8 year s
old, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admittin g
evidence under MCL 768.27a that the defendant allegedly
assaulted his 13-year-old stepdaughter a few months earlie r
and was convicted in Arizona of child molestation against a
different child after the abuse in this case occurred. People v
Duenaz, 306 Mich App 85, 98, 100 (2014). “[T]he trial cour t
applied the proper standard by asking whether the evidenc e
was more prejudicial than probative.” Id. Specifically, “the trial
court correctly found that these [other-acts against th e
defendant’s stepdaughter] were similar to the present crimes ”
where the defendant’s assault on his stepdaughter was simila r
to the crime for which he was on trial because both crime s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-75
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
involved anal and vaginal penetration, the defendan t
threatened both victims with harm to their families if the y
discussed the assault, the age difference was not material, and
less than six months elapsed between the two crimes. Id. at 100.
“The evidence of the similar assault against the other victi m
was very probative and important to the prosecution’s case,
especially because defendant was able to claim a lack o f
physical evidence,” and “the passage of time had faded th e
victim’s memory regarding some details.” Id. The evidence wa s
also “relevant because it tended to show that it was mor e
probable than not that the minors were telling the truth.” Id.
The evidence of defendant’s previous conviction was als o
properly admitted because although details of the offense wer e
not disclosed, it was a conviction of a crime of the same general
category (involving sex crimes against a child) that tended t o
make the victim’s story more believable by showing propensit y
to commit the charged offense, and it was not “too far removed
temporally from the instant offenses in Michigan.” Id. at 101.
Where the defendant was on trial for first-degree criminal
sexual conduct against his then 9-year-old son, the trial cour t
did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence under MCL
768.27a that the defendant inappropriately touched hi s
nephew when his nephew was 9 years old and living with th e
defendant. People v Solloway, 316 Mich App 174, 191-192 (2016).
The Court held that the other-acts evidence was relevan t
because evidence that the defendant previously assaulted a 9-
year-old relative made it more probable that he committed th e
charged offense against his son, who was also related to th e
defendant and 9 years old. Id. at 193. Further, the evidence wa s
relevant to the victim’s credibility because “[t]he fact tha t
defendant committed a similar crime against his nephew mad e
it more probable that [his son] was telling the truth.” Id.
Additionally, MRE 403 did not bar admission of the other-acts
evidence where the six Watkins II considerations favored
admission. Solloway, 316 Mich App at 194-195. First, the other-
acts and the charged crime were similar – the victims were th e
same age, defendant was related to both of them, the offense s
occurred at a time when the victims were living with th e
defendant, and both offenses “involved defendant entering th e
victim’s bedroom in the middle of the night, climbing on top o f
him, and engaging in some sort of inappropriate touching.” Id.
Second, the fact that the acts occurred 12 years apart did no t
bar admission under MRE 403 in light of the similarity of th e
acts. Solloway, 316 Mich App at 195. Third, the defendant’ s
nephew testified that the inappropriate touching occurred
multiple times; “[t]herefore, it cannot be said that the other act s
occurred so infrequently to support exclusion of the evidence. ”
Page 2-76 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
Id. Fourth, there were no intervening acts that weighed agains t
admissibility. Id. Fifth, the defendant did not challenge the
credibility of the witness offering the other-acts evidence, and
the witness’s credibility was bolstered by the fact that th e
defendant pleaded guilty to CSC-IV with respect to hi s
conduct against the witness. Id. at 195-196. Sixth, “becaus e
there were no eyewitnesses to corroborate [the victim’s ]
testimony and to refute defendant’s theories in regard to th e
physical evidence of the crime, there was a need for evidenc e
beyond [the victim’s] and defendant’s testimony.” Id. at 196.
“[E]vidence of acquitted conduct is not inadmissible as a
matter of law when introduced as other-acts evidence in a
subsequent trial for a different offense.” People v Hoskins, 342
Mich App 194, 212 (2022). “MCL 768.27a does not, by its plai n
language, preclude the admission of other-acts evidence when
the defendant was acquitted of charges involving those acts. ”
Hoskins, 342 Mich App at 212.“[A]s with other evidence offered
under MCL 768.27a, the admissibility of evidence of a prior
acquittal depends on the application of MRE 403.” Hoskins, 342
Mich App at 212.
Applying MRE 403 to the facts of the case, the Hoskins Cour t
held that “the trial courts ruling to allow the prosecution t o
introduce evidence of [the defendant’s] acquitted acts was a n
abuse of discretion” because it “present[ed] a particularl y
unique risk of unfair prejudice” that “substantiall y
outweigh[ed] the evidence’s probative value.” Hoskins, 342
Mich App at 212, 213. The Court observed that due proces s
guarantees that an individual “who has been acquitted of a
crime” is “presumed innocent as to any acquitted conduct ”
and “prohibits a court from subjecting a defendant to a n
increased sentence based on acquitted conduct.” Id. at 213. “ A
jury considering other-acts evidence of acquitted conduct will
make its own independent determination of whether th e
defendant committed the acquitted acts, despite a previou s
jury’s unanimous verdict finding that defendant not guilty.” Id.
at 213 (“other-acts evidence of acquitted conduct is unfairl y
prejudicial because the accused must again defend agains t
allegations of which he has already been acquitted”). “Perhap s
most importantly, the introduction of other-acts evidence als o
presents the danger that a jury will convict the defendan t
solely because it believes he committed other criminal conduct,
a possibility that is particularly egregious when the defendan t
has been acquitted of these other acts.” Id. at 214. Accordingly ,
the Hoskins Court held that “although the evidence of this
acquitted conduct has some probative value — particularly t o
demonstrate [defendant’s] propensity to commit the charged
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-77
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
offenses — the danger of unfair prejudice from admitting thi s
acquitted conduct is extremely high.” Id. at 215 (concluding
that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the motio n
to exclude evidence of defendant’s acquitted conduct from a
prior trial for a different offense).
In People v Beck, 510 Mich 1, 8 (2022), the defendant’s first trial
in 2016 on two counts of CSC-II “for allegedly rubbing hi s
underage daughter TG’s genitals and chest through he r
clothing while he was alone with her” was declared a mistrial.
“In 2017, while awaiting retrial on the original charges,
defendant was accused of sexually penetrating one of his son’ s
friends, CS, who was a minor.” Id. As a result, Defendant wa s
“charged with two counts of CSC-I and one count of CSC-II. ”
Id. at 9. Subsequently, the 2016 charges and 2017 charges “were
jointly tried in a second trial” and “the jury found defendan t
guilty of all counts.” Id. at 9, 10. On appeal, the Michiga n
Supreme Court vacated the defendant’s convictions resultin g
from the 2016 charges because “the trial court’s inquiry wa s
insufficient to find manifest necessity [to declare a mistrial],
and therefore, retrial on the 2016 charges violated the Doubl e
Jeopardy Clauses of the federal and state Constitutions.” Id. a t
9.
However, the Court rejected the defendant’s argument that h e
was “entitled to a new trial for the 2017 charges because hi s
convictions on those counts were tainted by the admission o f
evidence during the joint trial relating to the 2016 charges[.] ”
Beck, 510 Mich at 16. The Beck Court noted that “[w]hile the
evidence was admitted at the joint trial, the issue is whethe r
the trial court would have abused its discretion if it had
admitted this same evidence in a trial limited only to the 201 7
charges.” Id. at 17. Accordingly, the Court considered “whether
the testimony of defendant’s daughters and ex-wife would
have been inadmissible propensity evidence if the charges ha d
been tried separately.” Id. at 18.
When a defendant is charged with committing a listed offens e
against a minor, MCL 768.27a allows for the admission o f
evidence “for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant ”
that the defendant committed another listed offense against a
minor. Beck, 510 Mich at 19. The victim of the 2016 charge s
against the defendant and the victim of the 2017 charge s
testified at the defendant’s retrial. Id. at 9. Further, although the
defendant objected, the court permitted the defendant’s ex-
wife and three of his other daughters to testify about thei r
experiences with the defendant. Id. at 10. The evidence wa s
relevant to the charges in the 2017 retrial, but the Court had
also to examine the evidence as indicated by MRE 403. Beck,
Page 2-78 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
___ Mich at ___. The Court analyzed the evidence under MRE
403 as instructed by the Court in People v Watkins (Watkins II),
491 Mich 450 (2012). Beck, ___ Mich at ___. Admission of th e
other-acts evidence under Watkins II required the Court t o
consider the dissimilarity, temporal proximity, frequency of th e
intervening acts, reliability of evidence in support of the othe r
acts, and whether there was a need for evidence other than th e
testimony of the defendant and a complainant. Id. at ___.
Under MCL 768.27a, and after the probative/prejudicial test of
MRE 403, the Court concluded that evidence of the defendant’ s
conduct related to the 2016 charges and the testimony of othe r
witnesses about the defendant’s conduct with them wa s
properly admitted to show the defendant’s propensity t o
commit listed offenses against a minor. Beck, ___ Mich at ___.
As a result, the convictions arising from the 2017 charges wer e
valid. Id. at ___.
C. Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, Offenses Involving
Commercial Sexual Activity, Human Trafficking, or
Prostitution–§ 768.27b
MCL 768.27b governs the admissibility of evidence of other acts of
domestic violence, sexual assault, or acts constituting violations of
MCL 750.448 to MCL 750.462h (commercial sexual activity, huma n
trafficking, or prostitution) during a criminal evidentiary hearing or
trial in which the defendant is charged with an offense involvin g
domestic violence, sexual assault, or a violation listed in MCL
750.448 to MCL 750.462h (offenses involving commercial sexual
activity, human trafficking, or prostitution).
47
MCL 768.27b “doe s
not limit or preclude the admission or consideration of evidence
under any other statute, including, but not limited to, under [MCL
768.27a], rule of evidence, or case law.” MCL 768.27b(3). The plai n
language of MCL 768.27b allows the court to consider evidence
admitted under any other rule of evidence, including rules no t
specifically mentioned in MCL 768.27b. People v Propp, 508 Mich 374,
385-386 (2021). MCL 768.27b does not prevent the court from
precluding evidence of other acts of domestic violence or sexual
assault under MRE 802 as inadmissible hearsay. Propp, 508 Mich a t
385-386.
“[P]rior-bad-acts evidence of domestic violence can be admitted a t
trial because ‘a full and complete picture of a defendant’ s
history . . . tend[s] to shed light on the likelihood that a given crim e
was committed.’” People v Cameron, 291 Mich App 599, 610 (2011) ,

quoting People v Pattison, 276 Mich App 613, 620 (2007) (alteration in
48
original).
MCL 768.27b states in part:
“(1) Except as provided in [MCL 768.27b(4)], in a
criminal action in which the defendant is accused of a n
offense involving domestic violence, sexual assault, or a
violation of [MCL 750.448 to MCL 750.462h (offense s
involving commercial sexual activity, huma n
trafficking, or prostitution)], evidence of the defendant’ s
commission of other acts of domestic violence, sexua l
assault, or acts constituting violations of . . . MCL
750.448 to . . . [MCL 750.462h], is admissible for an y
purpose for which it is relevant, if it is not otherwis e
excluded under [MRE] 403.
* * *
(4) Evidence of an act occurring more than 10 year s
before the charged offense is inadmissible under thi s
section unless the court determines that 1 or more of th e
following apply:
(a) The act was a sexual assault that was reported
to law enforcement within 5 years of the date of the
sexual assault.
(b) The act was a sexual assault and a sexual
assault evidence kit was collected.
(c) The act was a sexual assault and the testing of
evidence connected to the assault resulted in a
DNA identification profile that is associated wit h
the defendant.
(d) Admitting the evidence is in the interest of
justice.”
MCL 768.27b(1) has “three express limitations on the introduction
of prior acts of domestic violence or sexual assault in curren t
prosecutions for offenses involving domestic violence or sexual
assault.” People v Berklund, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). “First, th e
introduction of such evidence is limited by [MCL 768.27b(4)], whic h
precludes the admission of evidence of an act occurring more tha n
10 years before the charged offense unless certain listed exception s

apply.” Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “Second, the introduction of such evidence is barred [b y
MCL 768.27b(1)] where the evidence is excluded under [MRE 403].”
Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “This makes relevancy, as defined in MRE 401 and MRE
402, the third express limitation in MCL 768.27b(1) on the admissio n
of prior acts of domestic violence or sexual assault in curren t
prosecutions for offenses involving domestic violence or sexual
assault.” Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___. Accordingly, “when a
defendant is charged with an offense involving domestic violence,
evidence of the defendant’s commission of other acts of domesti c
violence or sexual assault is admissible under MCL 768.27b(1)
subject to the three limitations identified above.” Berklund, ___ Mic h
App at ___.
“The Legislature in MCL 768.27b(1) did not differentiate between
prosecutions for offenses involving domestic violence and
prosecutions for offenses involving sexual assault.” Berklund, __ _
Mich App at ___. “Rather, the Legislature placed the law governing
the admission of propensity evidence in prosecutions for these tw o
types of offenses in the same subsection of the same statute.” Id. a t
___. “This evidences the Legislature’s intent for these types of
offenses to be considered together. Id. at ___ (“If the Legislatur e
intended for the prosecutions of these offenses to be considered
separately, it could have made that intention clear by placing the
law governing the kind of propensity evidence admissible i n
prosecutions for the different offenses in different statutes or
different subsections.”). Accordingly, “in a criminal action in whic h
the defendant is accused of an offense involving domestic violence,
evidence of the defendant’s commission of other acts of sexual
assault is admissible under MCL 768.27b(1) so long as the evidenc e
is not excluded by MCL 768.27b(4) or MRE 403, and is relevant. ”
Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___.
Although MCL 768.27b “does not define ‘interest of justice,’” “the
exception should be narrowly construed.” People v Rosa, 322 Mic h
App 726, 733-734 (2018). Rather, “evidence of prior acts tha t
occurred more than 10 years before the charged offense i s
admissible under the [interest of justice exception in] MCL 768.27b
only if that evidence is uniquely probative or if the jury is likely t o
be misled without admission of the evidence.” Rosa, 322 Mich Ap p
at 734 (concluding that testimony about abuse that occurred at leas t
16 years before the charged crimes was not uniquely probative or
needed to assure that the jury was not misled because it wa s
“consistent with and cumulative to [the current victim’s] testimony
49
regarding defendant’s character and propensity for violence”).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-81
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
The Michigan Court of Appeals extended to MCL 768.27b the
holding in Pattison, 276 Mich App at 558, that MCL 768.27a does not
constitute an ex post facto law. People v Schultz, 278 Mich App 776,
778-779 (2008). In rejecting the defendant’s ex post facto argument,
the Court stated:
“[MCL 768.27b] does not permit conviction on less
evidence or evidence of a lesser quality. As with the
sister statute [(MCL 768.27a)] analyzed in Pattison, MCL
768.27b did not change the burden of proof necessary to
establish the crime, ease the presumption of innocence,
or downgrade the type of evidence necessary to suppor t
a conviction. Therefore, the statute affects only the
admissibility of a type of evidence, and its enactmen t
did not turn otherwise innocent behavior into a criminal
act.” Schultz, 278 Mich App at 778-779 (internal citation s
omitted).
In addition, MCL 768.27b does not violate the separation of power s
doctrine. Schultz, 278 Mich App at 779. The Court responded to th e
defendant’s separation of powers argument by emphasizing that th e
Legislature’s passage of MCL 768.27b was a reaction to the judicially
created standards in MRE 404(b). Schultz, 278 Mich App at 779. The
Court stated that “[MCL 768.27b] is a substantive rule engendere d
by a policy choice, and it does not interfere with our Suprem e
Court’s constitutional authority to make rules that govern the
administration of the judiciary and its process.” Schultz, 278 Mich
App at 779. Further, “MCL 768.27b does not infringe on [th e
Michigan Supreme] Court’s authority to establish rules of ‘practice
and procedure’ under Const 1963, art 6, § 5.” People v Mack, 49 3
Mich 1, 3 (2012).
See M Crim JI 4.11a for an instruction on Evidence of Other Acts of

Domestic Violence.
1. Notice Requirement
MCL 768.27b requires the prosecuting attorney to disclos e
evidence admissible under this statute, “including th e
statements of witnesses or a summary of the substance of an y
testimony that is expected to be offered, to the defendant no t
49Note that effective March 17, 2019, MCL 768.27b was amended to expand the admission of prior act s
occurring more than 10 years before the charged offense to include certain sexual assaults (in addition t o
still allowing admission of prior acts “in the interest of justice”). See 2018 PA 372. Rosa was decided before
this statutory amendment.
50A similar jury instruction has not been adopted to instruct on evidence of other acts of sexual assault
following the amendment of MCL 768.27b to include offenses involving sexual assault. See 2018 PA 372,
effective March 17, 2019.

less than 15 days before the scheduled date of trial or at a late r
time as allowed by the court for good cause shown.” MCL
768.27b(2).
“[A]lthough failure to provide notice [under MCL 768.27b(2)]
constitutes plain error, it may be deemed harmless and
therefore not grounds for reversal.” People v Lowrey, 342 Mic h
App 99, 117 (2022). In Lowrey, the defendant argued “that the
trial court erred by admitting evidence of prior domestic and
sexual abuse between himself and the victim because of lack o f
notice.” Id. at 115. However, “defendant fail[ed] to articulat e
how he would have proceeded differently” or provide “an y
offer of proof to the effect that the victim’s testimony wa s
untrue.” Id. at 118. Although “it was plain error for [evidenc e
of prior abuse] to be admitted without providing prope r
notice,” the Lowrey Court determined that the evidence wa s
relevant and “the probative value of this evidence was [not ]
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.” Id.
at 118, 119. Because defendant was unable to “demonstrat e
that any error was outcome-determinative,” the Court o f
Appeals concluded that he was “not entitled to relief.”Id. a t
119.
2. Test for Admission
“MCL 768.27b(1) plainly states that, when a defendant is
accused of an offense involving domestic violence, evidence of
the defendant’s commission of other acts of domestic violenc e
or sexual assault is admissible provided that it is relevant and
not excluded by MCL 768.27b(4) or MRE 403.” People v
Berklund, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (rejecting defendant’ s
argument that “MCL 768.27b(1) only permits evidence of a
defendant’s commission of other acts of sexual assault to b e
admitted when the defendant is accused of an offens e
involving sexual assault, not when . . . the defendant is accused
of an offense involving domestic violence”). See also People v
51
Cameron, 291 Mich App 599, 610 (2011). “To make thi s
determination, the court must first decide whethe r
introduction of the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial,
then “weigh the probativeness or relevance of the evidenc e
against the unfair prejudice.” Cameron, 291 Mich at 611
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
Relevant evidence of domestic violence or sexual assault act s
that satisfies this standard must be admitted by the trial court.
51Effective March 17, 2019, 2018 PA 372 amended MCL 768.27b to include offenses involving sexual
assault.

See People v Daniels, 311 Mich App 257, 274 (2015) (holdin g
that in the defendant’s trial for molesting and abusing two o f
his children, “MCL 768.27b required the trial court to admit ”
the testimony of his other children “regarding the physical
violence defendant committed against them,” because “(1) i t
[was] relevant; (2) it describe[d] acts of ‘domestic violence ’
53
under [MCL 768.27b(6)(a) ]; and (3) its probative value [was]
not outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice under MRE
403”; the testimony was “highly probative because i t
demonstrate[d] defendant’s violent and aggressive tendencies,
as well as his repeated history of committing physical abuse o f
all his children—not just [the named victims in the case]”).
“Evidence is logically relevant if it is material and probative. ”
Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___, citing People v Crawford, 45 8
Mich 376, 388 (1998), and MRE 401. “Evidence is material if it i s
related to a fact that is of consequence to the action.” Berklund,
___ Mich App at ___. “Evidence is probative if it tends to mak e
the existence of any fact that is of consequence to th e
determination of the action more probable or less probabl e
than it would be without the evidence.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Propensity evidence is logicall y
relevant because a person who has committed an offense ma y
be more likely to commit that or another offense than a perso n
who has not committed that or any other offense.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up). “MRE 404(b) generally excludes the admission o f
propensity evidence—the rule prohibits evidence of a
defendant’s other crimes, wrongs, or acts to prove th e
defendant’s propensity to commit such acts.” Berklund, __ _
Mich App at ___.
“MCL 768.27b is an exception to this general bar on propensity
evidence; in prosecutions for offenses involving domesti c
violence or sexual assault, MCL 768.27b permits evidence of a
defendant’s prior commission of domestic violence or sexual
assault to show the defendant’s character or propensity t o
commit such acts.” Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___ (“Thi s
reflects a legislative determination that juries should have a
full and complete picture of a defendant’s history when th e
defendant is accused of domestic violence or sexual assaul t
because that history tends to shed light on the likelihood that a
given crime was committed.”) (cleaned up).
52 Effective March 17, 2019, 2018 PA 372 amended MCL 768.27b to include offenses involving sexual
assault.

“The prior act does not have to be identical to the charged
offense to be relevant and possibly admissible under MCL
768.27b.” People v Wade, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned
up). “The statute itself defines ‘domestic violence’ and a n
‘offense involving domestic violence,’ and the defendant’s pas t
conduct and current charge need only fit into these definition s
to fall within the statute’s ambit.” Wade, ___ Mich App at ___;
see MCL 768.27b(6)(a)(i) (defining an “offense involving
domestic violence” as “[c]ausing or attempting to caus e
physical or mental harm to a family or household member”);
MCL 768.27b(6)(b)(iv) (defining “family or househol d
member” to include “[a]n individual with whom the perso n
has or has had a dating relationship”). In Wade, “[d]efendant’ s
alleged offense of murdering [the victim], with whom he had a
dating relationship, clearly fit[] the definition of an ‘offense
involving domestic violence.’” Wade, ___ Mich App at ___.
“And his past alleged conduct of beating [his former-
girlfriend], with whom he also had a dating relationship,
clearly fits the definition of ‘domestic violence.’” Id. at ___.
“Defendant was therefore charged with an offense involvin g
domestic violence, so his other acts of domestic violenc e
against [his former girlfriend] were admissible unless exclude d
under MRE 403.” Wade, ___ Mich App at ___.
“Evidence of defendant’s past conduct towards [his former
girlfriend] was relevant to show that defendant was
controlling, deceitful, and, in particular, exceptionally violen t
toward his relationship partners.” Id. at ___ (observing tha t
defendant’s former girlfriend’s “testimony . . . was relevant t o
show not only that defendant physically abused hi s
relationship partners, but that the abuse included shootin g
them—albeit, in [his former-girlfriend’s] case, with batteries—
and using his revolver to inflict harm”). Defendant’s former
girlfriend’s “testimony was also relevant to show tha t
defendant lacked self-control and would commit acts o f
serious violence toward his partners.” Id. at ___. However ,
“nothing suggested that defendant had killed a partne r
before.” Id. at ___. But the “testimony demonstrate d
defendant’s propensity to commit violent acts against women,
and given the particularly violent conduct [his former
girlfriend] described, defendant’s shooting [the victim] would
have merely been a step up from defendant’s typical behavior,
not wholly out of character.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). “When considered along with the other
evidence, [defendant’s former girlfriend’s] testimony abou t
defendant’s other acts of domestic violence was probative o f
whether defendant murdered [the victim], which weighs in
favor of admission under MRE 403.” Wade, ___ Mich App a t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-85
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
___ (“Defendant’s contention that the evidence ‘had little
probative value, if any at all,’ is simply wrong.”). Becaus e
defendant failed to show that the evidence was unfairl y
prejudicial, “the trial court properly admitted the other-act s
evidence under MCL 768.27b.” Wade, ___ Mich App at ___.
In Berklund, the defendant “responded to the prosecution’ s
notice by objecting to the use of his prior conviction as other-
acts evidence.” Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___. “[D]efendan t
argued that evidence that he previously committed sexual
assault was not admissible under MCL 768.27b because (1)
prior acts of sexual assault could only be admitted i n
prosecutions for sexual assault, and defendant was no t
charged with sexual assault in this matter; (2) the nearly 20-
year-old sexual-assault conviction lacked any relevance to a
determination of defendant’s guilt or innocence in this cas e
because the other act was too remote in time, involved a
different victim, and the charged offenses were not sexual i n
nature; and (3) any probative value attributable to the other-
acts evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfai r
prejudice in light of the differing factual circumstance s
between the other act and the charged offenses.” Berklund, __ _
54
Mich App at ___. The Berklund Court rejected defendant’ s
arguments. Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___. In sum, the Cour t
concluded that “[e]vidence that defendant previousl y
committed sexual assault [was] relevant to proving tha t
defendant committed the offenses involving domesti c
violence . . . because it supported [the victim’s] credibility ,
presented circumstances similar to those underlying th e
charged offense, provided the jury with a more complet e
picture of defendant’s history, and demonstrated defendant’ s
propensity to commit the type of conduct with which he wa s
charged.” Id. at ___.
“[W]hen applying MRE 403 to evidence admissible under
MCL 768.27b, courts should weigh the propensity inference i n
favor of the evidence’s probative value rather than it s
prejudicial effect.” Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___. The same
nonexhaustive list of considerations identified in People v
Watkins (Watkins II), 491 Mich 450 (2012), applies:
“(1) the dissimilarity between the other acts and
the charged crime, (2) the temporal proximity of
54The Court noted that “defendant committed the sexual assault more than 10 years before the instant
offense, but evidence of the prior sexual assault was not precluded by MCL 768.27b(4) because the sexual
assault ‘was reported to law enforcement within 5 years of the date of the sexual assault,’ MC L
768.27b(4)(a), and ‘a sexual assault evidence kit was collected,’ MCL 768.27b(4)(b)”). Berklund, ___ Mich
App at ___.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.4
the other acts to the charged crime, (3) the
infrequency of the other acts, (4) the presence of
intervening acts, (5) the lack of reliability of the
evidence supporting the occurrence of the other
acts, and (6) the lack of need for evidence beyond
the complainant’s and the defendant’s testimony.
This list of considerations is meant to be
illustrative rather than exhaustive.” [Berklund, ___
Mich App at ___, citing Watkins II, 491 Mich at 487-
488 (quotation marks omitted).]
The Berklund Court held that the trial court “correctl y
recognized that evidence defendant previously committe d
sexual assault would be prejudicial in the sense that it woul d
attempt to prove that the defendant committed the crime wit h
which he was charged, but would not be unfairly prejudicial
because . . . the evidence’s propensity inferences weigh in favor
of the evidence’s probative value, not its prejudicial effect. ”
Berklund, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “And to any extent that a danger of unfair prejudic e
may persist, the trial court can minimize that danger b y
instructing the jury on the proper use of the other-act s
evidence.” Id. at ___. “Because evidence of defendant’s prior
sexual assault is highly relevant and it is not apparent that th e
evidence will be unfairly prejudicial (particularly in light of a
limiting instruction), the trial court did not abuse its discretio n
when it concluded that the evidence’s probative value was no t
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. ”
Id. at ___.
In Cameron, 291 Mich App at 605, the trial court admitted
evidence of the defendant’s prior abusive conduct towards th e
victim and another ex-girlfriend. Under the first inquiry, th e
Court found that the admitted evidence “did not stir suc h
passion as to divert the jury from rational consideration of [th e
defendant’s] guilt or innocence of the charged offenses,” and
that “the trial court minimized the prejudicial effect of the bad-
acts evidence by instructing the jury that the issue in the cas e
was whether [the defendant] committed the charged offense. ”
Id. at 611-612. Under the second inquiry, the Court found tha t
the evidence was relevant (1) to establish the victim’ s
credibility, (2) to show that the defendant acted violentl y
toward the victim and that his actions were not accidental, and
(3) to show the defendant’s propensity to commit acts o f
violence against women who were, or had been romanticall y
involved with him. Id. at 612. The Court concluded that “[th e
defendant’s] prior bad acts were relevant to the prosecutor’ s
domestic violence charge under MCL 768.27b,” and that “[a]n y
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-87
Section 2.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
prejudicial effect of admitting the bad-acts evidence did no t
substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence[.] ”
Cameron, 291 Mich App at 612. Accordingly, “the trial court did
not abuse its discretion when it allowed [the defendant’s ]
prior-bad-acts evidence to be introduced under MCL 768.27b. ”
Cameron, 291 Mich App at 612. See also People v Meissner, 29 4
Mich App 438, 452 (2011) (although different from the charge d
offense, the defendant’s “prior acts of domestic violenc e
illustrated the nature of defendant’s relationship with [th e
victim] and provided information to assist the jury in assessin g
her credibility”).
In People v Pattison, 276 Mich App 613, 615 (2007), th e
defendant was charged with four counts of first-degre e
criminal sexual conduct (CSC-I) for the alleged sexual abuse of
his minor daughter that occurred repeatedly over two year s
while she lived with him. The Court of Appeals relied on MCL
55
768.27b in determining that the prosecutor could introduc e
evidence of the defendant’s other alleged sexual assault s
against his ex-fiancee. Pattison, 276 Mich App at 615-616. Th e
Court concluded that evidence of CSC-I against the
defendant’s ex-fiancee was admissible under MCL 768.27b
because the evidence was “probative of whether he used thos e
same tactics to gain sexual favors from his daughter.” Pattison,
276 Mich App at 616. Having found the evidence admissible
under MCL 768.27b, the Court did not review the evidence’ s
admissibility under MRE 404(b). Pattison, 276 Mich App at 616.
Where the proposed testimony of a defendant’s previous act s
of domestic violence is highly relevant to the defendant’ s
tendency to commit the crime at issue, it may be admissibl e
under MCL 768.27b. People v Railer, 288 Mich App 213, 220-22 1
(2010). In Railer, the prosecution was permitted to call th e
defendant’s former girlfriends to testify about the defendant’ s
threats and physical abuse during their respectiv e
relationships with him. Id. at 220. The Court concluded tha t
their testimony described “behavior [that] clearly meets th e
definition of ‘domestic violence’ under [MCL 768.27b],
[behavior that] occurred within 10 years of the charged offens e
as required by MCL 768.27b(4), and [behavior that] would b e
highly relevant to show defendant’s tendency to assault [th e
victim] as charged.” Railer, 288 Mich App at 220.
55 MCL 768.27b permits trial courts to “admit relevant evidence of other domestic assaults to prove any
issue, even the character of the accused, if the evidence meets the standard of MRE 403.” Pattison, 27 6
Mich App at 615. Note that Pattison was decided before MCL 768.27b was amended to include offense s
involving sexual assault. See 2018 PA 372, effective March 17, 2019.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.5
2.5 Habit or Routine Practice
A. Rule
“Evidence of a person’s habit or an organization’s routine practice
may be admitted to prove that on a particular occasion the person or
organization acted in accordance with the habit or routine practice.
The court may admit this evidence regardless of whether it i s
corroborated or whether there was an eyewitness.” MRE 406.
B. Requirements
Evidence of habit or routine practice must demonstrate a pattern,
show that something was done routinely, or that the action wa s
executed innumerable times. Laszko v Cooper Laboratories, Inc, 114
Mich App 253, 256 (1982). The testifying witness must have know n
about the routine procedure prior to testifying and mus t
understand the steps involved in the practice. Id.
Evidence of the victim’s lifelong fear of the dark, including the fac t
that she routinely avoided being alone in the dark, was admissible
to rebut the defendant’s claims that the victim’s death occurred after
he left her alone in the dark at their boathouse deck. People v Unger,
278 Mich App 210, 227 (2008). The Court stated that “a rational jury
could have concluded that the victim would not have voluntarily
stayed on the boathouse deck alone after dark and that defendan t
had therefore fabricated his account of the events leading up to the
victim’s death.” Id.
2.6 Prior Accidents
Evidence of prior accidents is admissible to show a defendant’s notice o r
knowledge of the defective or dangerous condition alleged to hav e
caused the accident, as well as to show that a defect or dangerou s
56
condition in fact existed. Gregory v Cincinnati, Inc, 202 Mich App 474,
479 (1993). “The requisite foundation for such admissibility is a showin g
of similarity of conditions and reasonable proximity in time.” Maerz v US
Steel Corp, 116 Mich App 710, 723 (1982).
2.7 Subsequent Remedial Measures
“When measures are taken that would have made an event less likely t o
occur, evidence of subsequent measures is not admissible to prov e
56 See Section 5.4 on negative evidence.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-89
Section 2.7 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.” MRE 407.
“But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such a s
impeachment or — if disputed — proving ownership, control, or the
feasibility of precautionary measures.” Id.
“The purpose of MRE 407 is to encourage, or at least not to discourage,
people from taking steps in furtherance of added safety.” Ellsworth v
Hotel Corp of America, 236 Mich App 185, 189 (1999). However, evidenc e
of subsequent repairs may be admissible if the following criteria are met:
“(1) evidence of subsequent remedial action is otherwise
relevant, (2) admission of the evidence would not offend
policy considerations favoring encouragement of repairs,
and (3) the remedial action is not undertaken at the directio n
of a party plaintiff so that it does not constitute a self-serving,
out-of-court declaration by that party.” Denolf v Frank L Jursik
57
Co, 395 Mich 661, 669-670 (1976).
In Denolf, after the plaintiff sustained injuries, a safety guard wa s
installed on the truck lift that had injured the plaintiff’s hand. Denolf, 39 5
Mich at 666. The jury was allowed to view the truck, and photos of th e
truck, with the altered lift. Id. The Court stated that MRE 407 “i s
primarily grounded in the policy that owners would be discouraged
from attempting repairs that might prevent future injury if they feared
that evidence of such acts could be introduced against them.” Denolf, 39 5
Mich at 667. However, the Court concluded the exclusion wa s
inapplicable in the case because “evidence of subsequent repairs was no t
introduced for the purpose of establishing the negligence of [defendant],
which undertook the remedial action, nor did it prejudice [defendant] i n
any way. Id. at 669. The exclusionary rule “is confined to the contex t
where (1) evidence of subsequent remedial action is otherwise relevant,
(2) admission of the evidence would not offend policy consideration s
favoring encouragement of repairs, and (3) the remedial action is no t
undertaken at the direction of a party plaintiff so that it does no t
constitute a self-serving, out-of-court declaration by that party.” Id. a t
669-670.
In Ellsworth, plaintiff sought “to impeach defendant’s witness wit h
evidence that defendant renovated [its] sidewalks after plaintiff’s fall.
Ellsworth, 236 Mich App at 187. “[E]vidence of a subsequent remedia l
measure is admissible as impeachment when the opposing party ha s
denied making a repair,” and the impeachment evidence “may be eithe r
direct or circumstantial.” Id. at 189. An objection to the impeachmen t
evidence is not a prerequisite to admission of the evidence. Id. at 19 0
(holding the trial court erred in concluding plaintiff was required t o
57Denolf was decided prior to the 1978 adoption of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, but the Court
considered a rule similar in substance to MRE 407.
Page 2-90 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.8
object to the evidence). Ellsworth involved an “extensive renovatio n
project, [where] defendant replaced three thousand feet of sidewalk,
which necessarily included the area where plaintiff fell,” at least 7
months after plaintiff’s accident. Id. “This was not a ‘subsequent remedial
repair’ as described in MRE 407. The construction was too remote in tim e
from plaintiff’s accident and covered too large a territory to b e
considered a ‘repair’ to the accident site.” Ellsworth, 236 Mich App at 190.
“There was no evidence to suggest that this large-scale constructio n
project was prompted by or otherwise related to plaintiff’s fall;” thus, i t
was “not the sort of ‘repair that may be used to impeach testimony tha t
no repair was made after the plaintiff’s accident.” Id.
2.8 Settlements and Settlement Negotiations
“Evidence of the following is not admissible to either prove or disprov e
the liability for or the validity or amount of a disputed claim: (1)
furnishing, promising, or offering — or accepting, promising to accept, o r
offering to accept — a valuable consideration in compromising or
attempting to compromise the claim; and (2) conduct or a statemen t
made during compromise negotiations.” MRE 408(a). “If this evidence i s
otherwise discoverable, it need not be excluded merely because it i s
presented during compromise negotiations. And it need not be excluded
if admitted for another purpose, such as proving a witness’s bias or
prejudice, negating a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort t o
obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.” MRE 408(b).
Defense counsel’s “comment that ‘the hospital’s been dismissed’ did no t
violate MRE 408” because the “observation that [the hospital] had bee n
dismissed was accurate and, on its face, was not a statement about th e
existence or terms of a settlement–the hospital could have bee n
‘dismissed’ by stipulation or through summary disposition—or abou t
any conduct related to the settlement. For the same reasons, th e
statement did not violate the trial court’s prohibition in the settlemen t
order against ‘disclosure of the terms of the settlement to any person
other than the parties, their attorneys, and appropriate court officials.’ ”
Carlsen Estate v Southwestern Mich Emergency Servs, PC, 338 Mich App 678,
695 (2021) (noting “[t]here [was] simply . . . no merit to plaintiffs ’
allegation that the hospital’s comment violated either MRE 408 or the
trial court’s order”).
“Statements made by judges, attorneys, and witnesses during the cours e
of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged if they are relevant,
material, or pertinent to the issue being tried”; that privilege extends t o
statements made during the course of settlement negotiations where th e
statement is made after the commencement of and in context of th e
58
present litigation. Oesterle v Wallace, 272 Mich App 260, 264, 268 (2006).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-91
Section 2.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Although not expressly addressed by MRE 408, evidence of a settlemen t
made by a party with a nonparty is inadmissible to prove liability.
Windemuller Electric Co v Blodgett Mem Med Ctr, 130 Mich App 17, 23
(1983). In Windemuller, the Court found that admitting evidence of a
settlement between the plaintiff and a third party constituted prejudicial
error where the evidence went to a substantive issue in the case (th e
plaintiff’s liability). Id. at 24. However, where a defendant-insurance
agency “was not a party to the settlement or any part of the settlemen t
process and was involved only to the extent of giving its approval
pursuant to plaintiffs’ policy, which explicitly excluded . . . coverage ‘t o
any person who settles a bodily injury claim without [defendant’s ]
written consent,’” evidence of its consent is not barred by MRE 408.
Chouman v Home-Owners Ins Co, 293 Mich App 434, 439 (2011) (alteratio n
in original; finding that the defendant’s consent “was [not], itself, a
compromise of a dispute defendant had with any party or nonparty” and
59
thus, was not subject to exclusion under MRE 408 ).
MRE 408 is not limited to precluding evidence of settlements and
settlement negotiations only in the present litigation; it can also act t o
preclude such evidence from other cases when the evidence is relevant t o
the present litigation. See Alpha Capital Mgt, Inc v Rentenbach, 287 Mich
App 589, 621 (2010) (“the trial court incorrectly determined that MRE 408
lacks applicability to settlements ‘in another case,’ because the rul e
plainly does not take into account a ‘prior action’ exception”).
2.9 Medical Expenses
“Evidence of furnishing, promising to pay, or offering to pay medical,
hospital, or similar expenses resulting from an injury is not admissible t o
prove liability for the injury.” MRE 409.
2.10 Plea Discussions
“In a civil or criminal case, evidence of the following is not admissibl e
against the defendant who made the plea or participated in the ple a
discussions:
(1) a guilty plea that was later withdrawn or vacated;
(2) a nolo contendere plea — except that, to the extent tha t
evidence of a guilty plea would be admissible, evidence of a
nolo contendere plea to a criminal charge may be admitted i n
58See Section 1.9 for additional information on privilege.
59 Ultimately, the Chouman Court concluded that this evidence was inadmissible under MRE 401 and MR E
403. Chouman, 293 Mich App at 439-440.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.10
a civil proceeding to defend against a claim asserted by the
person who entered the plea;
(3) a statement made during a proceeding on either of those
pleas under MCR 6.302 or MCR 6.310, a comparable stat e
procedure, or Fed R Crim P 11; or
(4) a statement made during plea discussions with a n
attorney for the prosecuting authority if the discussions did
not result in a guilty plea or they resulted in a later-
withdrawn or vacated guilty plea.” MRE 410(a).
However, the court may admit a statement described in MRE 410(a)(3) or
MRE 410(a)(4) “(1) in any proceeding in which another statement made
during the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced, if i n
fairness the statements ought to be considered together” or “(2) in a
criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement, if the defendant mad e
the statement under oath, on the record, and with counsel present.” MRE
410(b).
A defendant may waive the protections provided by MRE 410, “as long
as they are appropriately advised and as long as the statements admitted
into evidence are voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly made. ”
People v Stevens, 461 Mich 655, 668-669 (2000). If a defendant injects the
issue, he or she may not later claim reversible error based on th e
prosecutor’s further questioning about the subject. People v Knight, 122
Mich App 584, 593 (1983).
Applicability. “MRE 410 applies when (1) the defendant has an actua l
subjective expectation to negotiate a plea at the time of the discussion,
and (2) that expectation is reasonable given the totality of the objectiv e
circumstances.” People v Smart, 304 Mich App 244, 249 (2014) (quotation
60
marks and citation omitted). “[MRE 410(a)(4) ] does not require that a
statement made during plea discussions be made in the presence of a n
attorney for the prosecuting authority. It only requires that th e
defendant’s statement be made [‘during plea discussions’] with [the ]
prosecuting attorney.” People v Smart, 497 Mich 950 (2015) (overruling th e
statement in People v Hannold, 217 Mich App 382, 391 (1996), that an
attorney for the prosecutor must be present). “Under such circumstances,
it is helpful to examine whether the discussions with other person s
occurred at the direction of a lawyer for the prosecuting authority. ”
People v Cowhy, 330 Mich App 452, 463 (2019).
Waiver. While MRE 410(a)(1) “protects a defendant who pleads guilty
but later decides to withdraw that guilty plea,” this protection “can b e

Section 2.10 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
waived.” People v Gash, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). In Gash,
“[d]efendant signed a special consideration agreement with th e
prosecution in which he agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a lesse r
sentence.” Id. at ___. “Under the language of the agreement, defendan t
consented to statements he made during his guilty plea being used
against him in future proceedings, unequivocally waiving the protection s
afforded to him by MRE 410(a)(1).” Gash, ___ Mich App at ___.
Accordingly, “after defendant withdrew his guilty plea and proceeded t o
trial, MRE 410(a)(1) no longer constrained the prosecution from bringin g
up defendant’s guilty plea during trial.” Gash, ___ Mich App at __ _
(holding that “[i]t was thus reasonable for defense counsel to addres s
defendant’s guilty plea before the prosecution could” because it “allowed
the defense to get ahead of the issue”).
Statements made to social worker. Incriminating statements that the
defendant made to a social worker in anticipation of sentencing,
subsequent to entering a plea but prior to withdrawing it, were no t
subject to MRE 410 because defendant “did not have a subjective
expectation to negotiate a plea, and even if he did, his expectation wa s
not reasonable under the totality of the circumstances” because “the ple a
agreement had already been entered and [defendant] had pleaded guilt y
pursuant to it.” Cowhy, 330 Mich App at 465-466 (defendant’ s
“expectation at the time he made the statements was to receive a mor e
lenient sentence, not to receive a better plea agreement with th e
prosecution”; although not barred from admission under MRE 410, th e
Court held that the statements were protected by the psychologist-
61
patient privilege ).
Statements made at sentencing. Inculpatory statements made by the
defendant at sentencing and in a presentence-investigation report afte r
entering a plea but prior to withdrawing it were not subject to MRE 410.
People v Erickson, 339 Mich App 309, 319 (2021). There was no indicatio n
that the defendant believed that he was actively negotiating a ple a
agreement at the time the statements were made because the ple a
agreement had already been finalized and he offered the statements t o
request leniency in sentencing. Id at 319. “[E]ven if defendant did believ e
he was still negotiating the plea, that belief was not objectivel y
reasonable given the totality of the circumstances . . . [because] the term s
of the plea agreement were set forth at the plea hearing, and the cour t
made very clear to defendant that the plea did not, in fact, encompas s
sentencing.” Id. at 319-320.
Affidavit to withdraw plea. Where the record did not support under the
totality of the circumstances that the defendant had a subjectiv e

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.11
expectation to negotiate a plea when he “submitted his affidavi t
[containing inculpatory statements] in support of withdrawing his guilt y
plea,” he was not engaged in plea discussions “with a lawyer for th e
prosecuting authority” and thus, his inculpatory statements were no t
62
precluded by MRE 410. Cowhy, 330 Mich App at 466; MRE 410(a)(4).
Statements made to defendant’s attorney. The defendant’s inculpatory
statements made to his attorney before he entered into a plea agreemen t
“were used to inform [the attorney’s] advice to [the defendant] regardin g
the plea.” Cowhy, 330 Mich App at 467. Therefore, the statements wer e
not protected by MRE 410 because they “were not made in the course of
plea negotiations with a lawyer for the prosecuting authority or at th e
direction of a lawyer for the prosecuting authority” and “there [was]
nothing in the record to suggest that when [defendant] made the
statements he had a subjective expectation to negotiate a plea with th e
prosecuting authority or that such an expectation would be reasonabl e
under the totality of the circumstances.” Cowhy, 330 Mich App at 467
(although defendant’s statements to his attorney were not barred fro m
admission under MRE 410, the Court held that they were protected b y
63
the attorney-client privilege ).
2.11 Statements Made to Individual or Individual’s Family
Involved in Medical Malpractice Actions
“A statement, writing, or action that expresses sympathy, compassion,
commiseration, or a general sense of benevolence relating to the pain,
suffering, or death of an individual and that is made to that individual o r
to the individual’s family is inadmissible as evidence of an admission of
liability in an action for medical malpractice.” MCL 600.2155. MCL
600.2155 does not apply to “statement[s] of fault, negligence, or culpable
conduct that [are] part of or made in addition to a statement, writing, o r
action described in [MCL 600.2155(1).]” MCL 600.2155(2).
2.12 Insurance Coverage
“Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is no t
admissible to prove whether the person acted negligently or otherwis e
wrongfully. But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose,
such as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice or — if controverted —
proving agency, ownership, or control.” MRE 411. See also MCL
500.3030, which precludes reference to the insurer or the question of

carrying insurance during the course of a trial, except as otherwis e
provided by law.
“It has been repeatedly held that it is reversible error to intentionall y
interject the subject of insurance if the sole purpose is to inflame th e
passions of the jury so as to increase the size of the verdict. On the othe r
hand, it is not reversible error if the subject is only incidentally brough t
into the trial, is only casually mentioned, or is used in good faith fo r
purposes other than to inflame the passions of the jury.” Cacavas v
Bennett, 37 Mich App 599, 604 (1972) (internal citations omitted).
“References to the insurance coverage of either party during voir dire i s
presumptively improper. However, this presumption may be rebutted
and any error regarded as harmless.” Phillips v Mazda Motor Mfg (USA)
Corp, 204 Mich App 401, 411 (1994) (internal citations omitted), abrogated
64
on other grounds Ormsby v Capital Welding, Inc, 471 Mich 45 (2004).
Offending counsel must overcome, “by a persuasive showing, a
presumption that his remarks were prejudicially improper.” Kokinakes v
British Leyland, Ltd, 124 Mich App 650, 652-653 (1983).
Committee Tip:
MRE 407–MRE 411 serve societal policy goal s
easily gleaned from their text (e.g. society
desires the repair of defective properties so a
party may not be penalized, from an evidentiary
proof standpoint, for having done so). But the
protection in these rules is limited. Discerning
the purpose for admission of these forms of
evidence is crucial in determining to include or
exclude the evidence. These rules—by no
means—contain blanket prohibitions.
2.13 Polygraph
A. Admissibility of Polygraph Examination or Results at
Trial
Evidence that a polygraph examination was taken or refused, or the
results of a polygraph examination are not admissible in a criminal
prosecution or a civil trial. People v Barbara, 400 Mich 352, 364 (1977) ;
64For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Page 2-96 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.13
People v Kahley, 277 Mich App 182, 183 (2007). “The bright-line rule
that evidence relating to a polygraph examination is inadmissible i s
well established.” People v Wade, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025 )
(quotation marks and citations omitted). “This rule bars not only th e
results of a polygraph examination but evidence about whether a
polygraph examination was administered or refused.” Id. at ___.
“Stated differently, this rule bars evidence relating to an actual
polygraph examination, including the results of such a n
examination, whether one was administered, whether the
defendant was asked to take one, and whether the defendant wa s
willing or unwilling to take one.” Id. at ___. “This prohibition stem s
not only from the scientific unreliability of polygraph examination s
but from the judicial concern that jurors will give disproportionate
weight to the results of polygraph examinations and consider the
evidence as conclusive proof of guilt or innocence.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up).
The exclusion of polygraph evidence is based on the basic rationale
that polygraphs have not gained the required degree of acceptance
or standardization among scientists. Barbara, 400 Mich at 364.; People
v Ray, 431 Mich 260, 265 (1988). Exclusion of polygraph results is
also based “upon the judicial estimate that the trier of fact will give
disproportionate weight to the results and consider the evidence a s
conclusive proof of guilt or innocence.” Ray, 431 Mich at 265.
Notwithstanding this policy of exclusion, statements made by a
defendant before, during, or after the administration of a polygrap h
examination are not excludable per se. Ray, 431 Mich at 268.
“Current procedures designed to test the voluntariness of suc h
statements are adequate to insure that a statement that is unreliable
or obtained without a knowing and intelligent waiver of a
defendant’s rights will not be used at trial.” Id.
The mere mention of a polygraph test may not require a mistrial.
People v Nash, 244 Mich App 93, 98 (2000). The court should conside r
the following factors in determining whether mention of a
polygraph is ground for a mistrial:
“(1) whether defendant objected and/or sought a
cautionary instruction; (2) whether the reference wa s
inadvertent; (3) whether there were repeated references;
(4) whether the reference was an attempt to bolster a
witness’s credibility; and (5) whether the results of th e
test were admitted rather than merely the fact that a tes t
had been conducted.” Nash, 244 Mich App at 98
(quotation marks and citations omitted).
If evidence of a polygraph test is admitted or improper argument i s
made about it, the court should immediately instruct the jury t o
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-97
Section 2.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
disregard the evidence and inform the jury of the unreliability of
such tests. See People v Ranes, 63 Mich App 498, 501-502 (1975).
1. Mention of Polygraph Required Reversal
When, during a bench trial, the prosecutor mentioned a
defendant’s polygraph examination, a copy of which was filed
with the court, and the judge questioned the officer regardin g
the number of polygraph tests he had performed in the past,
the conviction was reversed because the prosecutor’s injectio n
of the polygraph testing and results was unfairly prejudicial t o
the defendant’s case, even though the trial court found it had
not been influenced by this information. People v Smith, 21 1
Mich App 233, 234-235 (1995) (concluding that this wa s
unfairly prejudicial “because it provided supposedly scientifi c
evidence of defendant’s lack of credibility”).
Referencing a key prosecution witness’s polygraph durin g
direct examination seriously affected the fairness of the trial
and required a reversal. People v Nash, 244 Mich App 93, 95, 10 1
(2000) (defendant was prejudiced where “the reference to th e
polygraph test was brought out by the prosecutor, not as a
matter of defense strategy, and . . . the key prosecution witness,
who was involved in the crime and was the crucial witnes s
against the defendant, gave a responsive answer to th e
prosecutor’s question that was posed with the intent o f
bolstering the witness’ credibility and was later repeate d
before the jury during deliberations”).
2. Mention of Polygraph Did Not Require Reversal
Defendant’s former-girlfriend’s testimony “that defendan t
became concerned with the mere prospect of a polygrap h
examination after [the victim’s] murder [was relevan t
evidence], from which a jury could infer defendant’ s
consciousness of guilt.” People v Wade, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025). “It is true that this evidence could have an innocuou s
explanation, but it could also be consistent with a fear of bein g
investigated for [the victim’s] murder.” Id. at ___. “Wha t
significance to give to [the] disputed testimony, if any, was fo r
the jury to decide.” Id. at ___. “And when the jury did so, i t
would not have the type of polygraph-related evidence befor e
it that raises concerns—nothing that the jury heard suggeste d
that defendant took a polygraph, was asked to take a
polygraph, or was willing or unwilling to take a polygraph. ”
Id. at ___. “It follows that there was no danger that the jury
would draw the improper credibility inferences from [the ]
disputed testimony that the prohibition against polygrap h
Page 2-98 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.13
evidence is intended to curb.” Id. at ___ (reasoning tha t
“defendant’s desire to learn ‘how to pass a polygraph’ was no t
the kind of polygraph-related evidence that the jury would us e
improperly, it was relevant to defendant’s consciousness o f
guilt, and it was merely one of several pieces of evidenc e
suggesting that defendant wished to conceal the extent of hi s
involvement in [the victim’s] death”). “The evidence was, of
course, prejudicial to defendant in the way that all evidenc e
tending to establish a defendant’s guilt is prejudicial.” Id. at __ _
n 7. “But it was not unfairly prejudicial because it did not injec t
considerations extraneous to the merits of the case.” Id. “And
considering the relevance of the evidence, the evidence’ s
probative value was certainly not substantially outweighed b y
the danger of unfair prejudice as required to preclude th e
evidence under MRE 403.” Wade, ___ Mich App at ___ n 7.
“[R]eversible error does not exist where the polygrap h
reference is unsolicited, no mention is made of the results, and
where the court gives a complete cautioning instruction. ”
People v Ranes, 63 Mich App 498, 502 (1975). See Section 2.13(A)
for information on cautionary instructions.
A witness’s reference to conducting a “specialized interview ”
with the defendant was not considered improper o r
inadmissible because there was no specific reference to the fac t
that the interview was in fact a polygraph examination. People
v Triplett, 163 Mich App 339, 342-344 (1987), remanded on other
65
grounds 432 Mich 568 (1989). In addition, another witness’ s
testimony that was interrupted mid-sentence by the cour t
before the witness could mention the polygraph results wa s
neither improper nor inadmissible because there was n o
specific reference to the fact that the defendant had failed th e
polygraph examination. Triplett, 163 Mich App at 342-34 4
(furthermore, neither witness “deliberately attempted t o
inform the jury that defendant had failed his polygrap h
examination”).
A police officer’s testimony that the defendant refused to take a
polygraph examination did not require reversal because th e
officer’s reference was singular and brief; the prosecutor did
not argue that the defendant’s failure to take a polygrap h
examination was evidence of the defendant’s guilt; th e
defendant himself testified that he asked to take a polygrap h
test but was never given one; and the defendant confessed t o
the crime. People v Kahley, 277 Mich App 182, 183-184 (2007).
65For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-99
Section 2.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
B. Admissibility of Polygraph Examination or Results at
Sentencing
“[A] trial judge should not broach the subject of polygrap h
examinations nor induce defendant to take the examination for
sentencing purposes.” People v Towns, 69 Mich App 475, 478 (1976) .
A defendant’s presentence report should not contain the results of a
polygraph examination unless the defendant consents to their
inclusion, and a trial judge should not consider polygraph-
examination results when sentencing a defendant. People v Allen, 4 9
Mich App 148, 151-152 (1973). The integrity of a judge who claim s
he or she “only relied on trial evidence in sentencing” i s
unquestioned, but “the danger of [the trial judge’s] being influenced
is too grave to ignore.” Towns, 69 Mich App at 478. The defendan t
must be resentenced by a second judge with access only to a
presentence investigation report that is void of any informatio n
regarding a polygraph test. Id. at 479.
66
C. Exception to Inadmissibility: Motions for New Trial
and to Suppress Evidence
Polygraph results may be admissible in support of a motion for new
trial. People v Barbara, 400 Mich 352, 412 (1977). In addition, the court
has discretion to admit polygraph results in support of a motion t o
suppress illegally seized evidence. People v McKinney, 137 Mich Ap p
110, 114-117 (1984). In exercising its discretion to decide whether t o
admit polygraph evidence during a postconviction hearing for a
new trial or in support of a motion to suppress, the evidence mus t
meet the following conditions:
(1) the results are offered on the defendant’s behalf;
(2) the test was taken voluntarily;
(3) the professional qualifications of the polygrap h
examiner must be approved;
(4) the quality of the polygraph equipment must be
approved;
(5) the procedures employed must be approved;
(6) either the prosecutor or the court may obtain a n
independent examination of the subject by a n
operator of the court’s choice, or the independen t

information on postjudgment motions.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 2.13
operator is permitted to review the original data
with the original operator, or both;
(7) the results must be considered only with regard
to the general credibility of the subject;
(8) any affidavits or testimony by the test operator
must be a separate record and must not be used a t
a subsequent trial; and
(9) the judge granting a new trial may not sit a s
trier of fact in the new trial. However, he or she
may preside in a subsequent jury trial. A substitute
judge can have no knowledge of the polygrap h
examination or its results. McKinney, 137 Mich App
at 117.
See People v Mechura, 205 Mich App 481 (1994), for an example of
proper use of polygraph evidence in the context of a motion for a
new trial based on newly discovered evidence.
D. Right to Counsel
See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook,
Vol. 1, Chapter 4, for information on the right to counsel.
E. Defendant’s Right to Polygraph
A defendant accused of committing a criminal sexual conduc t
offense has the right to request a polygraph examination. MCL
776.21(5). See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Sexual Assault
Benchbook, Chapter 6, for more information on polygraph tests in
criminal sexual conduct cases.
F. Polygraph Examiners Privilege
There is a statutory privilege that applies to polygraph examiners.
MCL 338.1728. Information obtained by a polygraph examine r
during an examination conducted at the request of an attorney i s
subject to the attorney-client privilege. In re Petition of Delaware, 9 1
Mich App 399, 406-407 (1979). See Section 1.9 for information on

3.1 Scope Note
This chapter discusses rules of evidence and procedure applicable t o
witnesses generally. This chapter also specifically discusses lay witnes s
testimony. See Chapter 4 for a discussion of expert witnesses and
scientific evidence. See Chapter 6 for a discussion of exhibits.
3.2 Witness Disclosure
A. Civil Case
1. Witness List
“Witness lists are an element of discovery.” Grubor Enterprises,
1
Inc v Kortidis, 201 Mich App 625, 628 (1993). They serve th e
purpose of avoiding “‘trial by surprise.’” Id., quoting Stepp v
Dep’t of Natural Resources, 157 Mich App 774, 778 (1987).
The parties must file and serve their witness lists within th e
time limits prescribed by the court in MCR 2.401(B)(2)(a). MCR
2.401(I)(1). The witness list must include the witness’s name,
address (if known), whether the witness is an expert, and his o r
her field of expertise. MCR 2.401(I)(1)(a)-(b). However, only a
general identification is necessary if the witness is a record s
custodian “whose testimony would be limited to providing th e
foundation for the admission of records[.]” MCR 2.401(I)(1)(a).
2. Sanction for Failure to File Witness List
“The court may order that any witness not listed in accordanc e
with [MCR 2.401] will be prohibited from testifying at trial
except upon good cause shown.” MCR 2.401(I)(2). “While it i s
within the trial court’s authority to bar an expert witness o r
dismiss an action as a sanction for the failure to timely file a
witness list, the fact that such action is discretionary rathe r
than mandatory necessitates a consideration of th e
circumstances of each case to determine if such a drasti c
sanction is appropriate.” Dean v Tucker, 182 Mich App 27, 3 2
(1990). Just because a witness list was not timely filed does no t
in and of itself justify the imposition of such a sanction. Id.
1For additional information on discovery in a civil case, see the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Civil
Proceedings Benchbook, Chapter 5.
Page 3-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.1
The Dean Court referred to a nonexhaustive list of factors t o
consider when determining an appropriate sanction for a
discovery violation:
“(1) whether the violation was wilful or accidental;
(2) the party’s history of refusing to comply wit h
discovery requests (or refusal to disclose
witnesses);
(3) the prejudice to the [other party];
(4) actual notice to the [other party] of the witnes s
and the length of time prior to trial that the [other
party] received such actual notice;
(5) whether there exists a history of [the party]
engaging in deliberate delay;
(6) the degree of compliance by the [party] wit h
other provisions of the court’s order;
(7) an attempt by the [party] to timely cure the
defect[;] and
(8) whether a lesser sanction would better serve the
interests of justice.” Dean, 182 Mich App at 32-33.
“Trial courts should not be reluctant to allow unlisted
witnesses to testify where justice so requires, particularly wit h
regard to rebuttal witnesses.” Pastrick v Gen Tel Co of Mich, 16 2
Mich App 243, 245 (1987). The court may impose reasonabl e
conditions on allowing the testimony of an undisclosed
witness if there is no prejudice to the opposing party. Id. at 24 6
(concluding that the trial court employed reasonabl e
conditions in allowing the prosecutor’s undisclosed rebuttal
witness to testify by giving the “defendants an opportunity t o
interview the undisclosed witness and to secure their ow n
expert”). The Court also noted that a reasonable condition will
normally include a reasonable time frame. Id. at 246 n 1.
B. Criminal Case

1. Discovery Under the Court Rule
Upon request, a party must provide all other parties with th e
names and addresses of any lay or expert witnesses that ma y

be called at trial. MCR 6.201(A)(1). Alternatively, the part y
may provide the other party with the witness’s name and mak e
the witness available for interview. Id. “[T]he witness list ma y
be amended without leave of the court no later than 28 day s
before trial[.]” Id. But see MCL 780.758(2), which prohibit s
documents filed with the court from disclosing the address of
victims in a criminal case.
“[A]bsent an applicable exception provided for in MCR 6.201,
a prosecutor is required to produce unredacted police report s
under MCR 6.201(B)(2).” People v Jack, 336 Mich App 316, 326
(2021). In Jack, the prosecutor “provided a redacted polic e
report” that omitted “addresses, phone numbers, and
birthdates of several witnesses who were also included on th e
prosecutor’s witness list,” arguing that “MCR 6.201(A)(1)
allows a prosecuting attorney to redact witness contac t
information from police reports otherwise discoverable unde r
MCR 6.201(B)[.]” Jack, 336 Mich App at 320, 322. However ,
“MCR 6.201(A)(1) and MCR 6.201(B)(2) are two separat e
subrules that deal with two distinct disclosure requirements.
MCR 6.201(A)(1) exclusively concerns a party’s obligation t o
provide a list of the names and addresses of all witnesse s
whom may be called at trial or, in the alternative, the party ca n
provide the names of the witnesses and make them availabl e
for interviews. On the other hand, MCR 6.201(B)(2) concern s
the prosecutor’s obligation to provide police reports and
interrogation records. The information required to be disclose d
under [MCR 6.201(A)(1) and MCR 6.201(B)(2)] is separate and
distinct, and the prosecution must comply with the separat e
requirements of each section of the court rule. Jack, 336 Mic h
App at 325-326 (noting “the prosecutor may request a
protective order under MCR 6.201(E) or pursue a modification
under MCR 6.201(I)” on remand).
If a party violates the discovery rules in MCR 6.201, the cour t
has discretion to “order the party to provide the discovery o r
permit the inspection of materials not previously disclosed,
grant a continuance, prohibit the party from introducing i n
evidence the material not disclosed, or enter such other orde r
as it deems just under the circumstances.” MCR 6.201(J). “T o
be entitled to relief under MCR 6.201(J), a defendant mus t
demonstrate that he or she was prejudiced by the discover y
violation.” People v Dickinson, 321 Mich App 1, 19 (2017)
3 Effective May 1, 2020, MCR 6.201(A) is applicable to felonies and, in limited circumstances, to
misdemeanors. See MCR 6.001(A); MCR 6.610(E)(1)-(2), amended by ADM File No. 2018-23. “MCR
6.201(A) only applies in misdemeanor proceedings . . . if a defendant elects to request discovery pursuan t
to MCR 6.201(A). If a defendant requests discovery pursuant to MCR 6.201(A) and the prosecuting attorney
complies, then the defendant must also comply with MCR 6.201(A).” MCR 6.610(E)(2).

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.2
(finding the defendant did not demonstrate prejudice wher e
she failed to seek a continuance or other remedy as permitted
under MCR 6.201(J) and was able to effectively cross-examin e
the witness and obtain testimony favorable to her defens e
despite not having a second police report in advance of trial). I f
the court finds that an attorney willfully violated MCR 6.201 or
a discovery order, it may subject the attorney to an appropriat e
sanction. MCR 6.201(J).
Where the prosecution’s failure to disclose a transcript of a
witness’s prior statements, given pursuant to an investigativ e
subpoena, violated MCR 6.201(A)(2) but did not implicate the
defendant’s right to due process, the remedy fashioned by th e
trial court—precluding the prosecution from questioning th e
witness regarding the statements and allowing defens e
counsel to review the transcript before cross-examining th e
witness—did not constitute an abuse of discretion. People v
Jackson, 292 Mich App 583, 591-592 (2011).
2. Statutory Duties of Prosecuting Attorney
“Under the statutory framework in MCL 767.40a, the
prosecution is obligated to disclose all known res gesta e
witnesses, update its witness list, and provide the names o f
witnesses who the prosecution intends to call at trial.” People v
Butsinas, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025); see MCL 767.40a(1)-(3).
“A res gestae witness is someone who witnesses an event in th e
continuum of a criminal transaction and whose testimony wil l
aid in developing a full disclosure of the facts at trial.” Butsinas,
___ Mich App at ___ n 3. “The prosecution is obligated t o
exercise due diligence to produce endorsed witnesses at trial. ”
Id. at ___. “The prosecution no longer has an affirmative dut y
to call all res gestae witnesses at trial.” Id. at ___. “However, th e
prosecution is obligated to render reasonable assistance i n
locating and serving process upon a witness when requested i n
writing by defendant.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “A violation of MCL 767.40a does not result i n
automatic reversal.” Butsinas, ___ Mich App at ___. “Rather, if
the prosecution violates MCL 767.40a by failing to make th e
requisite efforts to produce a witness, the trial court mus t
determine if defendant was prejudiced by the witness’ s
absence.” Butsinas, ___ Mich App at ___ (holding tha t
defendant “failed to show he was prejudiced by the failure t o
produce” three current or former CPS workers but
“question[ing] the trial court’s underlying conclusion that th e
requisite efforts were not made to locate” them).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-5
Section 3.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
A prosecutor has a statutory duty to disclose any potentia l
witnesses, including res gestae witnesses, on the filed
information. MCL 767.40a(1). “[T]he term [res gestae witness]
embraces eyewitnesses to the corpus delicti of a crime. Bu t
where a person is present at the scene of an alleged crime, a t
the time of the alleged crime, has occasion to observe hi s
surroundings, and sees no crime, he too must be considered a
res gestae witness, whom the people are obliged by law to cal l
as a trial witness. This is but one example of one of th e
parameters that define a res gestae witness: a witness whos e
testimony is reasonably necessary to protect the defendan t
against a false accusation.” People v Harrison, 44 Mich App 578,
591 (1973) (citation omitted).
If additional res gestae witnesses become known, th e
prosecutor must continue to disclose their names. MCL
767.40a(2). A prosecutor must send the defendant a witness lis t
no less than 30 days before trial. MCL 767.40a(3). However,
“the prosecution [does not have] an affirmative duty to presen t
the entire res gestae, or call at trial all of the witnesses wh o
were present when a crime occurred.” People v Steanhouse, 31 3
Mich App 1, 15 (2015) (quotation marks and citation omitted) ,
aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds 500 Mich 453
4
(2017). Where “it [was] apparent that defendant was awar e
that [the potential witness] could be a res gestae witness” an d
“defendant implicated [the potential witness] in the [crime], ”
“omission [of the witness on the prosecutor’s witness list] did
not prejudice defendant, or violate his right to present a
defense[.]” Steanhouse, 313 Mich App at 15 (internal citations
omitted). Additionally, “[b]ecause [the potential witness ]
invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination and refused to testify, neither the prosecutio n
nor the defense could call [him] as a witness”; therefore, th e
prosecution did not “commit[] a plain error affectin g
defendant’s substantial rights by failing to include [th e
potential witness] on the witness list as a res gestae witness,
notifying the trial court of the need to inform [the potential
witness] of his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination, and failing to call [him] as a witness.” Id. at 16.
It is within the trial court’s discretion whether “to permit th e
prosecutor to add or delete witnesses to be called at trial ”
pursuant to MCL 767.40a(4). People v Callon, 256 Mich App 312,
325-326 (2003) (finding the court did not abuse its discretio n
“by allowing the late endorsement of a critical prosecutio n

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.2
witness where the witness was known to the defense, had bee n
subjected to cross-examination at the preliminar y
examination, . . . no continuance was requested and no unfair
prejudice resulted to defendant”).
However, “the trial court’s decision to allow removal of [a n
endorsed witness] from the prosecution’s witness list without
consideration of whether there was good cause to do so [a s
required under MCL 767.40a(4)] was an abuse of discretion[.]”
People v Everett, 318 Mich App 511, 520 (2017). “[T]o remov e
[the witness’s] name from the witness list, the prosecution wa s
required to comply with MCL 767.40a(4).” Everett, 318 Mic h
App at 523-525 (concluding that the defendant failed t o
establish that he was prejudiced by the error where there wa s
“nothing in the lower court record to suggest that th e
prosecutor lacked good cause for removing [the witness] fro m
the prosecution’s witness list” and there was “no indication o f
the testimony she would have offered” or whether th e
defendant “would have benefited from” it).
“[W]hen providing a defendant with the list of witnesses th e
prosecution ‘intends to produce’ at trial, a witness may not b e
‘endorsed in the alternative’ as an ‘and/or’ witness.” Everett,
318 Mich App at 522-523 (holding that the statute plainl y
requires a prosecutor to either endorse a witness that he or sh e
intends to call under MCL 767.40a(3) or amend the witness lis t
pursuant to MCL 767.40a(4) to add or remove a witness; the
statute does not allow for an “in-between ‘alternative’ witnes s
who may or may not be produced on the whim of th e
prosecution”).
“However, if the prosecutor fails to call a listed witness and
has failed to delete that witness from its witness list, it ma y
nonetheless be appropriate for the trial court to read [M Cri m
JI 5.12].” People v Cook (On Remand), 266 Mich App 290, 293 n 4
(2005) (citation omitted). M Crim JI 5.12 instructs that the jury
“may infer that [the] witness’s testimony would have bee n
unfavorable to the prosecution’s case” where the prosecuto r
was responsible for the appearance of the missing witness.
“[T]he propriety of reading [M Crim JI 5.12] will depend on the
specific facts of that case.” People v Perez, 469 Mich 415, 420-42 1
(2003). Instances that would justify the instruction include
those where an endorsed witness has not been properl y
excused or where the prosecution has not provided the defens e
reasonable assistance securing a witness that would have bee n
unfavorable to the prosecution. Id. at 420.
“If a prosecutor endorses a witness under [MCL 767.40a(3)],
the prosecutor is obliged to exercise due diligence to produc e

Section 3.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
that witness at trial.” People v Brown, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “If a prosecuto r
fails to exercise due diligence to produce the witness, the jur y
should be issued a missing-witness instruction[.]” Id. at ___.
“Due diligence is the attempt to do everything reasonable, no t
everything possible, to obtain the presence of a witness.” Id. a t
___ (cleaned up). In Brown, “[o]n the last day of the
prosecution’s proofs, the prosecutor stated that he had bee n
unable to secure the attendance of . . . two witnesses, who lived
together.” Id. at ___ (observing that a trial court may accept a
licensed attorney’s representation to the court when it has n o
reason to doubt the candor of that attorney). The prosecuto r
represented to the court that:
“the police attempted to serve them at tw o
different addresses on three different dates. The
female witness had reported a change of address,
but when the investigator attempted to serve the
witnesses there, the investigator saw no cars and
reported that the grass appeared overgrown. The
prosecutor personally attempted to contact the
female witness via the phone number provided for
a previous trial eight separate times over three
weeks. The phone number rang, was answered,
and then was immediately hung up. The
prosecutor attempted calling from different phone
numbers. The prosecutor also attempted to use
two jail systems to determine whether either
witness was imprisoned and discovered that bot h
had been arrested but were no longer in custody.”
Id. at ___.
The Court of Appeals rejected the defendant’s argument “tha t
the prosecutor could have sought to determine whether th e
female witness had a new phone number.” Id. at ___ (noting
that “the prosecution was not required to do everythin g
possible to locate the witnesses”). “Additionally, it [was ]
reasonable to infer that the witness continued to have the sam e
number because the phone rang, was picked up, and then wa s
hung up, rather than going to voicemail or simply goin g
unanswered.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the Brown Court hel d
that “the trial court’s decision to decline to issue a missing-
witness instruction after determining that the prosecutio n
exercised due diligence to secure the attendance of th e
witnesses did not fall outside the range of principled
outcomes.” Id. at ___.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.3
Committee Tip:
Remember to balance the claimed wrong with
an appropriate remedy; they should be
commensurate. Possible remedies for not
disclosing or providing a witness include
allowing opposing counsel to interview the
witness or continuing the trial for a day.
3.3 Sequestration of Witness
On its own motion or at the request of a party, “the court may orde r
5
witnesses excluded [from the courtroom so that they cannot hear other
witnesses’ testimony.” MRE 615. However, a party who is a natura l
person, a non-natural party’s representa]tive, or a person essential t o
presenting a party’s claim or defense may not be excluded. Id. See als o
MCL 600.1420.
A victim of a crime has the right to attend the trial and all othe r
proceedings related to that crime. Const 1963, art 1, § 24. However, if th e
victim is a witness, the court may, for good cause, sequester the victi m
until he or she first testifies. MCL 780.761; MCL 780.789 (juvenil e
proceedings). The victim must not remain sequestered once he or sh e
6
testifies. MCL 780.761; MCL 780.789.
A. Violation of Sequestration Order
The trial court has discretion to exclude or allow the testimony of a
witness that has violated a sequestration order. People v Nixten, 16 0
Mich App 203, 209-210 (1987). However, excluding a witness’ s
testimony for violating a sequestration order “is an extreme remedy
that should be sparingly used.” People v Meconi, 277 Mich App 651 ,
654 (2008). Other possible remedies include holding the offending
7
witness in contempt, and allowing cross-examination of th e
witness concerning the violation. Id.
In Meconi, the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the
victim’s testimony for violating the sequestration order when the

violation “resulted from an innocent mistake,” and the victim “only
heard short opening statements, not testimony[.]” Meconi, 277 Mic h
App at 654-655. Compare with People v Allen, 310 Mich App 328, 34 7
8
(2015), rev’d on other grounds 499 Mich 307 (2016), where the tria l
court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the testimony of a
witness who violated the court’s sequestration order where it s
decision was based on the witness’s violation of the sequestratio n
order and defense counsel’s violation of the court’s scheduling order
(counsel failed to provide notice of the witness).
3.4 Competency of Witness
“Every person is competent to be a witness unless: (a) the court finds,
after questioning, that the person does not have sufficient physical o r
mental capacity or sense of obligation to testify truthfully o r
understandably; or (b) [the MREs] provide otherwise.”MRE 601. To b e
competent, the witness must have “the capacity and sense of obligatio n
to testify truthfully and understandably.” People v Watson, 245 Mich Ap p
9
572, 583 (2001).
3.5 Criminal Defendant’s Right of Confrontation
10
A. Generally
A criminal defendant has the right to confront the witnesses agains t
them. US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, § 20; MCL 763.1. Th e
Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is made applicable t o
the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Pointer v Texas, 380
US 400, 403 (1965); People v Sammons, 191 Mich App 351, 356 (1991).
The Confrontation Clause implicates two broad categories of cases:
those involving the admission of out-of-court statements and those
involving restrictions imposed by law or the trial court on the scope
of cross-examination. Delaware v Fensterer, 474 US 15, 18 (1985). “B y
its straightforward terms, the Confrontation Clause directs inquiry
into two questions: (1) Does the person in controversy compromise
a ‘witness against’ the accused under the Confrontation Clause; and
(2) if so, has the accused been afforded an opportunity to ‘confront’
that witness under the Confrontation Clause?” People v Fackelman,
489 Mich 515, 562 (2011).
8For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
9 For information on the competency of a child witness, see Section 3.6(A).
10 For a discussion of confrontation issues in the context of hearsay exceptions, see Section 5.3(A).
Page 3-10 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
The protections of the Confrontation Clause extend to pretrial
entrapment hearings, Sammons, 191 Mich App at 362, and pretrial
suppression hearings, People v Levine, 231 Mich App 213, 223 (1998),
11
vacated on other grounds 461 Mich 172 (1999). However, the
protections do not apply at the preliminary examination. People v
Olney, 327 Mich App 319, 330-331 (2019).
“A primary interest secured by the Confrontation Clause is the righ t
of cross-examination.” People v Brown, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “The right of confrontatio n
insures that the witness testifies under oath at trial, is available for
cross-examination, and allows the jury to observe the demeanor of
the witness.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up) (observing that “[c]ross-
examination is a valuable right of the accused to expose falsehood s
and bring out the truth.”) “An inability to understand a witness ma y
interfere with a defendant’s right to cross-examine a witness,” such
as an inadequate translation. Id. at ___. However, the Confrontation
Clause guarantees only that a defendant has the opportunity for
effective cross-examination; a defendant is not guaranteed an ideal
cross-examination. United States v Owens, 484 US 554, 559 (1988)
(holding a defendant’s right to confrontation is satisfied when the
defendant has the opportunity to explore matters such as a witness’ s
poor eyesight, bias, and bad memory). Indeed, “the right of cross-
examination is not unfettered; it does not include a right to cross-
examine witnesses about irrelevant issues and may bend to other
legitimate interests of trial procedure or societal expectations.”
Brown, ___ Mich App at ___.
“[A] defendant’s right to confront a witness in the context of the
witness’s assertion of her Fifth Amendment right does not arise
unless there was substantial evidence put before the jury in the for m
of testimony or its functional equivalent.” People v Clark, 330 Mic h
App 392, 395 (2019). Where “[t]he prosecutor never got th e
opportunity to ask [the witness] a question, . . . her assertion of a
privilege was not associated with any questions that could serve a s
the functional equivalent of testimony.” Id. at 429. Additionally, th e
prosecutor’s indication during his opening statement that the
witness would testify and implicate defendant in a murder did no t
amount to the functional equivalent of testimony “because the
opening statement was separated in time from [the witness’s]
assertion of the privilege, because defense counsel responded to the
prosecutor’s summary in her opening statement, and because the
trial court instructed the jury that the parties’ opening statement s
were not evidence[.]” Id. at 429-430 (“[i]n the absence of evidenc e
that the prosecutor knew that [the witness] would assert her
11For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-11
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
privilege in front of the jury, defendant [could not] establish a plai n
evidentiary error”).
B. Scope
The right of the accused to confront witnesses is a crucial element of
the trial process and serves to protect the defendant’s right to a fair
trial. US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, § 20. Accordingly,
“[e]vidence directly implying the substance of a testimonial, out-of-
court statement made by an unavailable witness and offered t o
prove its truth is inadmissible[.]” People v Washington, 344 Mich Ap p
318, 333 (2022). “A witness may feel quite differently when he has t o
repeat his story looking at the man [or woman] whom he will har m
greatly by distorting or mistaking the facts.” Coy v Iowa, 487 U S
1012, 1019 (1988) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In Coy, th e
defendant’s right of confrontation was violated where a screen wa s
placed between him and the complaining witnesses. Id. at 1020. I n
People v Sammons, 191 Mich App 351, 356, 366 (1991), the defendant’ s
right of confrontation was violated when the trial court permitted a
police informant to testify at an entrapment hearing while wearing a
mask, and without disclosing his true identity, “[b]ecause the
masking . . . precluded the trial judge from adequately observing
the witness’ demeanor while testifying.”
“The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is to provide for a face-to-
face confrontation between a defendant and his accusers at trial.”
People v Serges, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “This confrontation is an important right of the
defendant because it enables the trier of fact to judge the witnesses’
demeanors.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted)
(observing that the Confrontation Clause protects a criminal
defendant’s “right physically to face those who testify against him”).
“The Supreme Court’s decision in Coy, 487 US at 1020-1022, does no t
mandate a conclusion that mask wearing during a pandemi c
violates the Confrontation Clause.” Serges, ___ Mich App at ___. I n
Serges, “for safety reasons, the trial court gave defendant a choic e
between wearing a mask or sitting at a distance from his trial
counsel,” and “[d]efendant chose to wear a mask.” Id. at ___, ___.
Further, “the record indicate[d] that the witnesses removed their
masks when they were on the stand and testifying,” and “[w]he n
defense counsel cross-examined the witnesses, he also removed hi s
mask.” Id. at ___, ___. “Defendant insist[ed] that, because he had t o
wear a mask, the witnesses were allowed to provide testimony
without viewing him.” Id. at ___. However, “[n]othing blocked th e
witnesses’ view of defendant during trial in this case nor interfered
with his view of the witnesses testifying. While defendant’s nose
and mouth were covered by a cloth mask, his eyes and upper face
were visible.” Id. at ___. “A cloth mask covering only part o f
Page 3-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
defendant’s face is not the same as a barrier to view. Defendan t
remained physically in the room with the witnesses, they could see
him, he could see them, and they underwent cross-examination by
his unmasked counsel.” Id. at ___ (rejecting defendant’s contentio n
that “the ‘face-to-face’ confrontation guarantee cannot be fulfilled
when a defendant is required to wear a mask”).
Indeed, “face-to-face confrontation is not an indispensable elemen t
of the Confrontation Clause”—“[t]he right may be satisfied withou t
face-to-face confrontation when denial of such confrontation i s
necessary to further an important public policy and only where the
reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured.” People v Brown, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted). I n
Brown, the defendant contended that his Confrontation Clause
rights were violated when a witness “was permitted to testify while
wearing a face mask” because “the mask interfered with the jury’ s
ability to assess [the witness’s] credibility by covering part of hi s
face and the mask made [the witness’s] testimony difficult t o
understand.” Id. at ___. However, the Court of Appeals conclude d
that “the face mask worn by [the witness] did not completely cover
his face and apparently did not impair a viewing of [the witness’s]
expressions or the ability to assess his credibility.” Id. at ___.
Moreover, “the trial court took measures, including directing [the
witness] to speak into the microphone and apparently shutting off
the ventilation system, to improve the clarity of [the witness’s]
testimony for the parties and the jurors listening to the testimony.”
Id. at ___ (noting that “[a]fter these measures were taken, there wer e
no complaints of a continued inability to hear or understand [the
witness’s] answers to the questions posed”). Further, “defens e
counsel was not limited in his questioning” on cross-examinatio n
and “was allowed to cover questions and topics raised during direc t
examination.” Id. at ___. Therefore, the Brown Court held that th e
defendant failed to demonstrate “that any error in his ability to hear
some of [the witness’s] answers affected the outcome of the lower
court proceedings because there is no indication that defendan t
missed and was unable to respond to [the witness’s] testimony in a
manner that impaired his ability to cross-examine him.” Id. at __ _
(acknowledging another jurisdiction’s statement that “protecting
people against COVID-19 transmission was an important publi c
policy interest,” and noting that the witness in Brown “expressed hi s
desire to continue wearing the mask in light of COVID-19”).
“In allowing [a forensic analyst’s] two-way, interactive vide o
testimony [at trial] over the defendant’s objection, the trial cour t
violated the defendant’s Confrontation Clause rights.” People v
Jemison (Jemison I), 505 Mich 352, 366-367 (2020) (remanded t o
“determin[e] whether that violation was harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt”). Where it was undisputed that the “evidence
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-13
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
was testimonial,” “[t]he defendant had a right to face-to-face cross-
examination; [the witness] was available, and the defendant did no t
have a prior chance to cross-examine him.” Id. at 366. Thus, “[t]he
defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to confrontatio n
were violated by the admission of [the witness’s] two-way,
interactive video testimony.” Id. “[E]xpert witnesses called by th e
prosecution are witnesses against the defendant,” and “[t]he
prosecution must produce” witnesses against the defendant. Id. a t
364 (further holding “expense is not a justification for a
constitutional shortcut”).
However, the right to confront witnesses is not absolute and may
succumb to other compelling interests. People v Kasben, 158 Mich
App 252, 255 (1987). For example, “the prohibitions [on question s
regarding a victim’s previous sexual conduct] in the rape-shield law
will not deny a defendant’s right of confrontation in the
overwhelming majority of cases[.]” People v Arenda, 416 Mich 1, 13
(1982). “While evidence of prior sexual conduct is generall y
prohibited, there are circumstances in which a minor’s sexual
knowledge is so probative that the defendant’s [constitutional] righ t
to confrontation or right to present a defense hinges on explaining
why that knowledge exists.” People v Masi, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025)
(observing that “in these circumstances, a defendant may probe a
minor’s sexual knowledge for the limited purposes of rebutting the
jury’s natural assumption concerning a child’s sexual innocence and
of protecting the defendant’s rights”) (quotation marks and citatio n
12
omitted).
“[T]he Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the use of a
procedure that, despite the absence of face-to-face confrontation,
ensures the reliability of the evidence by subjecting it to rigorou s
adversarial testing and thereby preserves the essence of effective
confrontation.” Maryland v Craig, 497 US 836, 857 (1990). I n
Maryland, the Court recognized an “important state interest in
preventing trauma to child witnesses in child abuse cases,” holding
that the defendant’s right of confrontation was not violated in a
child sexual abuse case where the child victim testified outside the
defendant’s physical presence via one-way closed-circuit television.
Id. at 856-857 (“where face-to-face confrontation causes significan t
emotional distress in a child witness, there is evidence that suc h
confrontation would in fact disserve the Confrontation Clause’ s
truth-seeking goal”). While not provided face-to-face, testimony
given under oath that is subject to full cross-examination and i s
observed by the judge, jury, and defendant in real time, is i n
13
harmony with the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 857.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
“[T]he Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the federal
Constitution does not apply in noncriminal settings,” such as PP O
proceedings. HMM, ___ Mich App at ___. However, “due proces s
includes the opportunity for meaningful cross-examination.” Id. a t
___. “By depriving respondent of the opportunity to cross-examin e
petitioner about the alleged sexual assault, the circuit cour t
increased the risk of erroneously depriving respondent of
significant liberty interests.” Id. at ___. “Allowing respondent t o
cross-examine petitioner properly would have diminished tha t
risk.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the circuit court abused its discretion
by prohibiting respondent’s counsel from fully cross examining
petitioner” and “permitting petitioner to testify off-camera”).
In People v Rose, 289 Mich App 499, 516 (2010), the trial court did no t
violate the defendant’s right to confrontation by permitting the child
victim to testify with a witness screen, where the trial court found
that the victim feared the defendant, that the witness screen wa s
necessary to protect the child’s welfare, that there was a hig h
probability that testifying face-to-face with the defendant would
cause psychological damage to the victim, and that having to testify
face-to-face with the defendant may cause the victim to abstain fro m
testifying altogether. Additionally, “aside from [the victim’s]
inability to see [the defendant], the use of the witness scree n
preserved the other elements of the confrontation right and ,
therefore, adequately ensured the reliability of the truth-seeking
process.” Id. at 516-517.
“In order to warrant the use of a procedure that limits a defendant’ s
right to confront his accusers face to face, the trial court must firs t
determine that the procedure is necessary to further an importan t
state interest. The trial court must then hear evidence and determine
whether the use of the procedure is necessary to protect the witness.
In order to find that the procedure is necessary, the court must find
that the witness would be traumatized by the presence of the
defendant and that the emotional distress would be more than de
minimis.” Rose, 289 Mich App at 516 (internal citations omitted).
13See People v Jemison (Jemison I), 505 Mich 352, 365 (2020), noting that Craig was decided prior t o
Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36 (2004), and although Crawford did not overrule Craig, the Court
indicated it “will apply Craig only to the specific facts it decided: a child victim may testify against the
accused by means of one-way video (or a similar Craig-type process) when the trial court finds,
consistently with statutory authorization and through a case-specific showing of necessity, that the chil d
needs special protection.” See also HMM v JS, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (noting that “a child victim in
a child-abuse prosecution [can] testify outside the presence of the defendant without violating th e
Confrontation Clause [if] a proper finding of emotional necessity was made, and the child testified unde r
oath, underwent a full cross-examination, and was observable by the judge, jury, and defendant”).

C. Removal of Defendant from Courtroom Due to Conduct
The Confrontation Clause guarantees the right of the defendant t o
be present at trial. Illinois v Allen, 397 US 337, 338 (1970). See als o
MCL 768.3. However, “a defendant can lose his right to be present a t
trial if, after he has been warned by the judge that he will be
removed if he continues his disruptive behavior, he nevertheles s
insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive,
and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on wit h
him in the courtroom.” Allen, 397 US at 343. “Once lost, the right to
be present can, of course, be reclaimed as soon as the defendant i s
willing to conduct himself consistently with the decorum and
respect inherent in the concept of courts and judicial proceedings.”
Id. Ordinarily, the defendant must be warned before he or she i s
removed from the courtroom, but a defendant may be removed
without a warning when his or her behavior is aggressive and
violent. People v Staffney, 187 Mich App 660, 664-665 (1990). See als o
People v Buie (On Remand), 298 Mich App 50, 59 (2012) (“[a]lthoug h
[the defendant] had a . . . history of acting out and disrupting [prior]
proceedings,” his removal from the courtroom following a single
interruption of voir dire was not justified where he was also no t
“continually warned by the court to modify his behavior to avoid
removal”).
A defendant may waive his or her constitutional and statutory righ t
to be present during trial. People v Kammeraad, 307 Mich App 98, 117-
118 (2014) (finding “defendant did not waive his right to be presen t
for trial through a voluntary relinquishment of the right when he
asked to be removed from the courtroom” because “the record [did]
not reflect that defendant was ever specifically informed of hi s
constitutional right to be present”; notwithstanding, “defendant los t
his right to be present because of his disorderly and disruptive
behavior”).
D. Unavailable Witness
The Confrontation Clause bars the admission of testimonial
statements of an unavailable witness unless the defendant had a
prior opportunity for cross-examination. Crawford v Washington, 54 1
14
US 36, 68 (2004). “However, the Confrontation Clause does no t
bar the use of out-of-court testimonial statements for purposes other
than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.” People v
Chambers, 277 Mich App 1, 10-11 (2007) (“a statement offered t o
Page 3-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
show the effect of the out-of-court statement on the hearer does no t
violate the Confrontation Clause”).
1. Constitutional Unavailability
“A declarant is considered to be unavailable as a witness if th e
declarant:
(1) is exempted from testifying about the subjec t
matter of the declarant’s statement because th e
court rules that a privilege applies;
(2) refuses to testify about the subject matter
despite a court order to do so;
(3) testifies to not remembering the subject matter;
(4) cannot be present or testify at the trial or
hearing because of death or a then-existing
infirmity, physical illness, or mental illness; or
(5) is absent from the trial or hearing, and
(A) the statement’s proponent has not bee n
able, by process or other reasonable means, t o
procure:
(i) the declarant’s attendance, in the case
of a hearsay exception under [MRE
804(b)(1)] or [MRE 804(b)(6)]; or
(ii) the declarant’s attendance or
testimony, in the case of a hearsay
exception under [MRE 804(b)(2)], [MRE
804(b)(3)], or [MRE 804(b)(4)]; and
(B) in a criminal case, the proponent show s
due diligence.” MRE 804(a).
However, MRE 804(a) “does not apply if the statement’ s
proponent procured or wrongfully caused the declarant’ s
unavailability as a witness in order to prevent the declaran t
from attending or testifying.” Id. Indeed, “the forfeiture-by-
wrongdoing rule, which is codified in MRE
804(b)(6), . . . provides that a statement is not excluded by th e
14 Crawford overruled, in part, Ohio v Roberts, 448 US 56 (1980), which permitted admission of a n
unavailable witness’s statement against a criminal defendant if the statement bore “adequate ‘indicia of
reliability’” and fell within either a “firmly rooted hearsay exception” or showed “particularized guarantees
of trustworthiness.” Roberts, 448 US at 66. Crawford is not retroactive. Whorton v Bockting, 549 US 406,
409 (2007).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-17
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable and the statement i s
offered against a party that has engaged in or encourage d
wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure th e
unavailability of the declarant as a witness.” People v Allen, ___
Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “To admit evidence under MRE 804(b)(6), the
prosecution must show by a preponderance of the evidenc e
that: (1) the defendant engaged in or encouraged wrongdoing;
(2) the wrongdoing was intended to procure the declarant’ s
unavailability; and (3) the wrongdoing did procure th e
unavailability.” Allen, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted) (concluding that “it [was not] clearl y
erroneous for the trial court to conclude that defendant’ s
statement to [his romantic partner] caused her to b e
unavailable for trial”).
In Allen, “defendant told [a romantic partner] during a phon e
conversation that she did not have to appear in court to testif y
even if she was subpoenaed.” Id. at ___. Specifically, “i n
response to [her] mentioning . . . that because she [had] no t
received a subpoena, she was not going to attend th e
preliminary examination, defendant said, ‘Even if they did
[serve her with a subpoena], do not go.’” Id. at ___. “And whil e
it is true that [she] was never served with a subpoena to appea r
at trial, defendant’s intent was patently clear that he did no t
want [her] to appear at trial, which she did not.” Id. at ___ .
Because “it [was not] clearly erroneous for the trial court t o
conclude that defendant’s statement to [his romantic partner ]
caused her to be unavailable for trial,” various out-of-cour t
statements she made were properly admitted under MRE
804(b)(6) and read into the record at trial. Id. at ___ (rejecting
the defendant’s argument that his right to confrontation wa s
violated when “[the trial court] admitted the evidence under
the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing rule”; “this forfeiture-by-
wrongdoing rule also acts as an exception to a defendant’ s
right of confrontation”).
“[A] declarant who appears at trial but claims memory loss i s
‘available’ for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, eve n
though [Michigan’s] hearsay rules provide that a declarant i s
unavailable when the declarant [‘testifies to not rememberin g
the subject matter,’] MRE 804(a)(3).” People v Sardy (O n
15
Remand), 318 Mich App 558, 565 (2017). Accordingly, “th e
Confrontation Clause does not place any constraints on the us e
of a prior testimonial statement, and . . . the Clause does no t
bar the admission of a prior testimonial statement ‘so long a s
15For information on unavailable witness, see Section 3.5(D).
Page 3-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.’” Id. at
563, quoting Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36, 59 n 9 (2004). I n
Sardy (On Remand), 318 Mich App at 565-566, a Confrontational
Clause violation occurred where “[a]lthough defendant wa s
able to cross-examine the victim at the preliminar y
examination, defendant was not given the opportunity t o
cross-examine her at trial relative to the CSC-I I
charges, . . . [and t]he jury was not presented with cross-
examination testimony regarding the fact that the victim could
no longer recall or remember the substance of the claims sh e
had made at the time of the preliminary examination”; thu s
defendant was deprived “of the opportunity to potentiall y
undermine entirely the charges of CSC-II.”
2. Testimonial and Nontestimonial Statements
“A statement is testimonial if it was made under circumstance s
which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believ e
that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. ”
People v Washington, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up).
Importantly, “the standard requires courts to consider th e
foreseeability—based on the context at the time the statemen t
was made—of whether the statement would later be used a t
trial.” Id. at ___. The United States Supreme Court has declined
to delineate a comprehensive definition of “testimonial,” bu t
has provided the following examples of testimonial and
nontestimonial statements:
Testimonial:
• formal police interrogations,
• prior testimony,
• plea allocutions, and
• depositions.
Nontestimonial:
• casual remarks to acquaintances,
• off-hand, overheard remarks,
• statements in furtherance of a conspiracy,
• statements unwittingly made to informants, and
• business records. Crawford v Washington, 541 U S
36, 51-52, 56-58 (2004).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-19
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Following Crawford, the Court clarified the definition of
“testimonial statement” in Davis v Washington, 547 US 81 3
(2006). The Court held that whether hearsay evidence
constitutes a “testimonial statement” requires a court t o
conduct an objective examination of the circumstances unde r
which the statement was obtained. Davis, 547 US at 826.
“Statements are nontestimonal when made in the course o f
police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicatin g
that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable polic e
assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.” Id. at 822 (emphasi s
added). “They are testimonial when the circumstance s
objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency,
and the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or
prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal
prosecution.” Id. (emphasis added). In Davis, the Cour t
concluded that statements made to a 911 operator wer e
nontestimonial because they described events “as they wer e
actually happening,” in an “ongoing emergency.” Id. at 827.
But in the companion case of Hammon v Indiana, the Cour t
concluded that statements made to the police at a crime scen e
were testimonial because they were made during the course o f
an investigation of past criminal conduct and there was n o
ongoing emergency. Id. at 826-832.
Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court expounded o n
the “primary purpose test” noting “there may be other
circumstances, aside from ongoing emergencies, when a
statement is not procured with a primary purpose of creatin g
an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.” Michigan v
Bryant, 562 US 344, 358 (2011). “One additional factor is the
informality of the situation and the interrogation.” Ohio v
Clark, 576 US 237, 245 (2015) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). However, the Michigan Supreme Court “has soundl y
rejected application of the ‘primary purpose’ test outside of a n
emergency context.” Washington, ___ Mich at ___ (noting tha t
“while Davis employed a primary purpose inquiry t o
determine whether statements made to the police in the ver y
specific context of an ongoing emergency were testimonial, Davis
did not mandate that this was the exclusive test to be applied
generally in Confrontation Clause cases”) (cleaned up).
Indeed, “nothing in Davis replaced the controlling standard i n
Crawford to determine whether a statement is ‘testimonial’
when made outside of an emergency context.” Washington, __ _
Mich at ___, n 5. See People v Fackelman, 489 Mich 515, 558-559
(2011) (although the primary purpose test “obviously make s
sense in the context for which it was specifically designed,
emergency circumstances in which there is often ambiguit y
concerning the objectives or purposes of the declarant’ s
Page 3-20 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
utterances[,] . . . [i]t is utterly unclear how a court would appl y
the ‘primary purpose’ test outside the Davis context to a case in
which no emergency is alleged”).
To determine whether statements made by a victim of sexual
abuse to a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) ar e
testimonial or nontestimonial in nature, the court “mus t
consider the totality of the circumstances of the victim’ s
statements and decide whether the circumstances objectivel y
indicated that the statements would be available for use in a
later prosecution or that the primary purpose of the SANE’ s
questioning was to establish past events potentially relevant t o
a later prosecution rather than to meet an ongoing emergency. ”
People v Spangler, 285 Mich App 136, 154 (2009). The Spangler
Court set forth a nonexhaustive list of factual indicia helpful t o
making an admissibility determination under th e
Confrontation Clause. See id. at 155-156. See also People v
Garland, 286 Mich App 1, 11 (2009), discussed in Sectio n
3.5(D)(2)(b), finding that statements made to a SANE wer e
nontestimonial under the facts of the case.
a. Examples of Testimonial Statements
Report and affidavit of laboratory analyst. An unswor n
forensic laboratory report in which a laboratory analys t
certified that he had tested the defendant’s blood-alcohol
concentration (BAC), and that the BAC was well above
the threshold for the crime of aggravated driving while
intoxicated, was created solely for an evidentiary purpose
and was therefore testimonial. Bullcoming v New Mexico,
564 US 647, 651-652, 663-664 (2011). Accordingly, “[t]he
[defendant’s] right [was] to be confronted with the analys t
who made the certification, unless that analyst [was]
unavailable at trial, and the [defendant] had a n
opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular
scientist”; the in-court “surrogate testimony” of a scientis t
who did not sign the report or perform or observe the tes t
was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the
Confrontation Clause. Id. at 652, 661-662 (holding that a
State could not introduce one lab analyst’s writte n
findings through the testimony of another).
An absent laboratory analyst’s report and notes ar e
testimonial if the out-of-court statements “have a n
evidentiary purpose” and their primary purpose “have a
focus on court.” Smith v Arizona, 602 US 779, 783 (2024)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “After all, some
records of lab analysts will not have an evidentiary
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-21
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
purpose.” Id. at 802 (instructing lower court to “conside r
the range of recordkeeping activities that lab analyst s
engage in” and determine whether the absent analyst’ s
report and notes were testimonial on remand). See also
Melendez-Diaz v Massachusetts, 557 US 305, 307-308, 311,
329 (2009) (the affidavits of state laboratory analyst s
stating that material seized by police and connected to the
defendant was a certain quantity of usable drug s
constituted testimonial hearsay and could not be
admitted as evidence unless the analysts who authored
the affidavits testified at trial or the defendant had the
opportunity to previously cross-examine them regarding
the affidavits); see also People v Payne, 285 Mich App 181 ,
196, 198 (2009) (the admission of a nontestifying DNA
analyst’s laboratory reports violated the defendant’s Sixt h
Amendment right to confrontation because the witnesse s
who actually testified concerning the laboratory report s
“had not personally conducted the testing, had no t
personally examined the evidence collected from the
victims, and had not personally reached any of the
scientific conclusions contained in the reports”; the
laboratory reports constituted testimonial hearsay absen t
a showing that the DNA analyst was unavailable to testify
and that the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-
16
examination).
Codefendant’s confession. A nontestifying codefendant’ s
formal, Mirandized confession to authorities i s
testimonial. Samia v United States, 599 US ___, ___ (2023).
In Samia, the United States Supreme Court held tha t
“altering a nontestifying codefendant’s confession not t o
name the defendant, coupled with a limiting instruction,
was enough to permit the introduction of suc h
confessions at least as an evidentiary matter.” Id. at ___.
Accordingly, the introduction of a nontestifying
codefendant’s “altered confession”—which “did no t
directly inculpate the defendant”—“coupled with a
limiting instruction did not violate the Confrontatio n
Clause.” Id. at ___.
Autopsy report. A statutorily-mandated autopsy repor t
prepared by two nontestifying medical examiners wa s
testimonial, and its admission violated the defendant’ s
Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. People v Lewis,
16 MCR 6.202 governs the admissibility of forensic laboratory reports and certificates. See Section 4.9 fo r
more information on forensic laboratory reports and certificates.
Page 3-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
490 Mich 921 (2011) (however, “the admission of the
report was not outcome determinative”).
Medical report of psychiatrist. A non-testifying
psychiatrist’s out-of-court medical report tha t
“memorialized defendant’s medical history and the
events that led to his admittance to the hospital, provided
[an] all-important diagnosis, and outlined a plan for
treatment” constituted a testimonial statement that wa s
used as substantive evidence of the defendant’s sanity i n
violation of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.
People v Fackelman, 489 Mich 515, 518-519, 532, 564 (2011).
In Fackelman, two testifying expert witnesses disagreed as
to whether the defendant was legally insane at the time of
the crimes, which was the sole issue at trial. Id. at 521, 538.
The defendant’s expert witness testified that in making
his determination that the defendant was legally insane,
he relied in part on a report prepared by a hospital
psychiatrist regarding the defendant’s psychiatri c
condition two days after the incident; however, the repor t
was neither authenticated nor admitted as evidence, and
the defendant did not elicit testimony regarding the
psychiatrist’s diagnosis. Id. at 536-541. On cross-
examination, the prosecutor revealed the hospital
psychiatrist’s diagnosis of “‘major depression, single
episode, . . . severe, without psychosis’”; the prosecutor
subsequently referred to the report in his examination of
the prosecution’s expert witness, who testified that she
agreed with the diagnosis. Id. at 522-523.
The Michigan Supreme Court held that the report, whic h
was made following the defendant’s arrest and “expressly
focused on defendant’s alleged crime and the charge s
pending against him,” constituted testimonial evidence
because it “was ‘made under circumstances which would
lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the
statement would be available for use at a later trial.’”
Fackelman, 489 Mich at 532, 533, quoting Crawford v
Washington, 541 US 36, 52 (2004). Moreover, “th e
prosecutor’s improper introduction and repeated use of
[the] diagnosis that defendant was not, in fact,
experiencing psychosis fully rendered the [psychiatrist] a
witness against defendant.” Fackelman, 489 Mich at 530.
Because the diagnosis “provided a tiebreaking exper t
opinion” by “the only expert unaffiliated with either
party . . . [and] the only doctor who had personal
knowledge concerning [the] dispositive issue,” its use a t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-23
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
trial constituted plain error requiring reversal of the
defendant’s convictions. Id. at 538, 564.
Expert forensic report. The admission of exper t
testimony based on a report prepared by non-testifying
forensic analysts violated the defendant’s Sixt h
Amendment right to confrontation because “the
testing . . . was performed in anticipation of a crimina l
trial, after the medical examiner’s original findings had
been challenged.” People v Dendel (On Second Remand), 28 9
Mich App 445, 468 (2010). Specifically, “[t]he medical
examiner did not merely delegate to the . . . laboratory a n
ordinary duty imposed by law: he sought from the lab
specific information to investigate the possibility of
criminal activity. Under th[o]se circumstances, any
statements made in relation to th[e] investigation took o n
17
a testimonial character.” Id.
Evidence implicitly introducing unavailable witness’ s
testimonial statement. “[A] defendant’s constitutional
right of confrontation may be violated when a trial
witness’s testimony introduces the substance of an out-of-
court, testimonial statement by an unavailable witness.”
People v Washington, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024). I n
Washington, the “[d]efendant drove across the borde r
from Michigan into Canada without paying the toll,” and
a Canadian customs agent “arrested defendant and
brought him back to the American side of the bridge”
where an American customs agent “took custody of
defendant and a bulletproof vest.” Id. at ___.
Subsequently, the “[d]efendant was charged with being a
violent felon in possession of body armor.” Id. at ___. Th e
American officer testified that he and the Canadian officer
met on the American side of the bridge and, based o n
communications between them, the American officer too k
custody of defendant and took possession of the body
armor at the same time. Id. at ___. The American officer
“acknowledged that defendant was not wearing the ves t
when he took defendant into custody and that he had n o
direct knowledge as to whether defendant ever possessed
the vest.” Id. at ___.
The Washington Court “conclud[ed] that [the Canadia n
Officer’s statement] was testimonial.” Id. at ___ (“Th e
context in which [the Canadian officer] made hi s
17 MCR 6.202 governs the admissibility of forensic laboratory reports and certificates. See Section 4.9 fo r
more information on forensic laboratory reports and certificates.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
statement would lead a reasonable person in his positio n
to believe the statement would be available for use at a
later trial.”) The Canadian officer’s out-of-court statemen t
was “that defendant possessed the bulletproof vest whe n
[the Canadian officer] encountered him.” Id. at ___. “[A]n
important factor is that the statement was made to . . . a
law enforcement officer.” Id. at ___. “Another importan t
factor suggesting that a reasonable person in [the
Canadian officer’s] position would believe his statemen t
would be available for use at a later trial is that [the
Canadian officer] made the statement while turning
custody of defendant over to [the American officer] after
having arrested defendant for engaging in criminal
activity.” Id. at ___. “And, because there was no ongoin g
emergency, even if [the Canadian officer] subjectively
intended for his statement to be used for a different, non-
trial purpose, that does not bear on whether a reasonable
person in his position would have foreseen that hi s
statement would be available for use at a later trial.” Id. a t
___. Accordingly, the Washington Court held that th e
defendant’s constitutional right of confrontation wa s
violated “because [the American officer’s] testimony
clearly implied that [the Canadian officer] made a
testimonial statement asserting that defendant possessed
a bulletproof vest.” Id. at ___.
Victim’s statements to neighbor and police officer. A
crime victim’s statements to a neighbor and a police
officer were improperly admitted because they
constituted testimonial statements for purposes of the
Confrontation Clause and the defendant had not had a n
opportunity to cross-examine the victim. People v Walker,
273 Mich App 56, 64 (2006). In Walker, after the defendan t
beat the victim and threatened to kill her, the victi m
jumped from a second-story balcony and ran to a
neighbor’s house, where the neighbor called 911. Id. at 59-
60. The victim made statements to the neighbor, wh o
wrote out the statements and gave them to the police. Id.
at 60. The victim did not appear for trial, but her
statements were admitted under the excited utterance
18
exception to the hearsay rule. Id. Like the United State s
Supreme Court in Davis v Washington, 547 US 813 (2006),
the Walker Court determined that the content of the 91 1
call was nontestimonial evidence properly admitted a t
trial because the operator’s questioning “was directed a t
eliciting further information to resolve the presen t
18For information on the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, see Section 5.3(B).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-25
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
emergency and to ensure that the victim, the neighbor,
and others potentially at risk . . . would be protected fro m
harm while police assistance was secured.” Walker, 27 3
Mich App at 64.
The Walker Court further concluded that “[u]nlike thos e
in the 911 call, the victim’s statement recorded in writing
by her neighbor and [her] statements to the police at th e
scene [we]re more akin to the statements in [Hammon v
Indiana, 547 US 813 (2006), a companion case to Davis],
which the Davis Court found inadmissible under th e
Confrontation Clause.” Walker, 273 Mich App at 64. The
Court explained:
“As in Hammon, in which the police
questioned the domestic assault victi m
separately from her husband and obtaine d
her signed affidavit of the circumstances o f
the assault, the police questioning in this cas e
first occurred in the neighbor’s home, an d
there is no indication of a continuing danger.
Rather, the victim’s statement recorded by th e
neighbor and [her] oral statements to th e
police recounted how potentially crimina l
past events began and progressed. Althoug h
portions of these statements could be viewe d
as necessary for the police to assess th e
present emergency, and, thus, nontestimonia l
in character, we conclude that, on the record
before us, these statements are generall y
testimonial under the standards set forth i n
Davis. ‘Objectively viewed, the primary, if no t
indeed the sole, purpose of [this ]
interrogation was to investigate a possibl e
crime—which is, of course, precisely what th e
officer[s] should have done.’ Accordingly, th e

statements to the police are inadmissible. ”

Serologist’s notes and laboratory reports. A
nontestifying serologist’s notes and laboratory report are
testimonial statements under Crawford. People v Lonsby,
268 Mich App 375, 378 (2005). In Lonsby, a crim e
laboratory serologist, who did not analyze the physical
evidence, testified regarding analysis that was performed
by another serologist. Id. at 380-381. The testimony
Page 3-26 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
included theories on why the nontestifying serologis t
conducted certain tests, as well as her notes regarding the
tests. Id. In Crawford, “the Court stated that pretrial
statements are testimonial if the declarant would
reasonably expect that the statement will be used in a
prosecutorial manner and if the statement is made ‘under
circumstances which would lead an objective witnes s
reasonably to believe that the statement would be
available for use at a later trial[.]’” Lonsby, 268 Mich Ap p
at 377-378, 391-393 (alteration in original), quoting
Crawford, 541 US at 51-52 (finding that because the
serologist would clearly expect that her notes and
laboratory report would be used for prosecutorial
purposes, the information satisfied Crawford’s definitio n
of a testimonial statement).
b. Examples of Nontestimonial Statements
Child’s statements to a teacher. Statements by a
preschool student to his teacher identifying the defendan t
as the person who caused his injuries were no t
testimonial because they were “clearly . . . not made wit h
the primary purpose of creating evidence for [the
defendant’s] prosecution.” Ohio v Clark, 576 US 237, 246
(2015). Thus, their admission during trial, even thoug h
the child was not available for cross-examination, did no t
violate the Confrontation Clause. Id. The Court explained
that statements to individuals who are not law
enforcement officers, such as teachers, “are much les s
likely to be testimonial than statements to law
enforcement officers,” further noting that “[s]tatement s
by very young children will rarely, if ever, implicate the
Confrontation Clause” Id. at 246, 247-248 (“declin[ing] t o
adopt a categorical rule excluding [statements to person s
other than law enforcement officers] from the Sixt h
Amendment’s reach”). The Court further noted that the
statements were made “in the context of an ongoing
emergency involving suspected child abuse,” and “the
immediate concern was to protect a vulnerable child wh o
needed help.” Id. at 246-247. There was “no indicatio n
that the primary purpose of the conversation was t o
gather evidence for [the defendant’s] prosecution,” and
“[a]t no point did the teachers inform [the child wh o
made the statements] that his answers would be used t o
arrest or punish his abuser.” Id. at 247. Finally, the chil d
who made the statements “never hinted that he intended
his statements to be used by the police or prosecutors.”

Match of a DNA sample to a database profile. Th e
Confrontation Clause was not violated by a forensi c
specialist’s testimony “that a DNA profile produced by a n
outside laboratory, [using semen from vaginal swab s
taken from the victim,] . . . matched a profile produced by
the state police lab using a sample of [the] petitioner’ s
blood[;] . . . that [the outside laboratory] provided th e
police with a DNA profile[; and that] . . . notations o n
documents admitted as business records[ indicated] that,
according to the records, vaginal swabs taken from the
victim were sent to and received back from [the outside
laboratory].” Williams v Illinois, 567 US 50, 56-58 (2012 )
(plurality opinion) (opinion by Alito, J.). Noting that,
“[u]nder settled evidence law, an expert may express a n
opinion that is based on facts that the expert assumes, bu t
does not know, to be true,” the Williams pluralit y
concluded that “[o]ut-of-court statements that are related
by the expert solely for the purpose of explaining the
assumptions on which that opinion rests are not offered
for their truth and thus fall outside the scope of the
Confrontation Clause.” Id. at 57-58. The forensic expert’s
testimony did not run afoul of the Confrontation Clause
where she “did not testify to the truth of any other matter
concerning [the outside laboratory,] . . . made no other
reference to the [outside laboratory’s] report, which wa s
not admitted into evidence and was not seen by the trier
of fact, . . . did [not] . . . testify to anything that was done
at the [outside] lab, and she did not vouch for the quality
20
of [its] work.” Id. at 71.
In addition, the Williams plurality expressed the vie w
that, “even if the report produced by [the outside
laboratory] had been admitted into evidence, there would
have been no Confrontation Clause violation,” because
the report “was produced before any suspect wa s
identified, . . . [and] was sought not for the purpose o f
obtaining evidence to be used against [the] petitioner,
who was not even under suspicion at the time, but for the
purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose.”
Williams, 567 US at 58. “The bottom line was that
[petitioner] lost, even though five [justices] rejected the
state court’s ‘not for the truth’ reasoning.” Smith v Arizona,

(quotation marks and citation omitted).
Absent laboratory analyst’s records. An absen t
laboratory analyst’s report and notes are not testimonial if
the out-of-court statements’ primary purpose is no t
“evidentiary” or “have a focus on court.” Smith, 602 US a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted) (instructing
lower court on remand to “consider the range of
recordkeeping activities that lab analysts engage in” and
determine whether the absent analyst’s report and note s
were testimonial). “After all, some records of lab analyst s
will not have an evidentiary purpose.” Id. at ___. Indeed,
“lab records may come into being primarily to comply
with laboratory accreditation requirements or to facilitate
internal review and quality control.” Id. at ___. “Or some
analysts’ notes may be written simply as reminders t o
self.” Id. at ___. “In those cases, the record would no t
count as testimonial.” Id. at ___.
Statements prior to death. Pre-death statements made by
a gunshot victim to police officers identifying and
describing his shooter and the location of the shooting
were nontestimonial and their admission at the
defendant’s trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause
because “the circumstances of the interaction betwee n
[the victim] and the police objectively indicate that the
‘primary purpose of the interrogation’ was ‘to enable
police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.’”
Michigan v Bryant, 562 US 344, 348-349, 378 (2011),
quoting Davis v Washington, 547 US 813, 822 (2006). I n
Bryant, the Court found that “there was an ongoing
emergency . . . where an armed shooter, whose motive for
and location after the shooting were unknown, had
mortally wounded [the victim] within a few blocks and a
few minutes of the location where the police found [the
victim].” Bryant, 562 US at 374 (declining to “decid e
precisely when [an] emergency end[s]”). The Cour t
additionally found that the primary purpose of the
interrogation was to enable police assistance to meet the
ongoing emergency where the questions the police asked
the victim were precisely the type of questions necessary
to allow them to assess the situation, the threat to their
own safety, and possible danger to the victim and the
public. Id. at 374-378.
A decedent’s statements identifying his assailant to the
police during the hectic minutes shortly after the fatal

shooting took place were admissible as nontestimonial
statements under Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36 (2004).
People v Taylor, 275 Mich App 177, 181-182 (2007).
A victim’s statements to friends, coworkers, and the
defendant’s relatives in the weeks before her death were
not testimonial statements and their admission did no t
violate the defendant’s right of confrontation. People v
Bauder, 269 Mich App 174, 180-187 (2005), abrogated o n
other grounds by People v Burns, 494 Mich 104, 11 2
21
(2013).
DataMaster logs. Admitting DataMaster logs reflectin g
that a particular DataMaster machine was tested by a n
operator who verified its accuracy and certified that i t
was in proper working order without calling the operator
to testify about his tests would not violate a defendant’ s
right to confrontation because the DataMaster logs are
nontestimonial. People v Fontenot, 333 Mich App 528, 536
(2020), vacated in part on other grounds ___ Mich ___
22
(2022). Specifically, the “logs were created before
defendant’s breath test to prove the accuracy of the
DataMaster machine; they were not created for the
purpose of prosecuting defendant specifically.” Id. at 535.
“Furthermore, the DataMaster logs were created as par t
of the Michigan State Police’s normal administrative
function of assuring that the DataMaster machine
produces accurate results,” and the machine “would have
been checked for proper functioning even if defendan t
had not been tested with it.” Id. at 535-536. Accordingly,
the logs reflecting the test results were nontestimonial
where the primary purpose of the test “was to comply
with administrative regulations and to ensure [th e
machine’s] reliability for future tests—not to prosecute
defendant specifically.” Id. at 536 (citation omitted).
Proof of mailing. A certificate generated by the Michiga n
Department of State (DOS) “to certify that it had mailed a
notice of driver suspension to a group of suspended
drivers” was not testimonial because “the creation of a
certificate of mailing, which is necessarily generated before
the commission of any crime, is a function of the
legislatively authorized administrative role of the DO S

independent from any investigatory or prosecutorial
purpose”; therefore, it could be admitted, for the purpose
of proving the notice element of the charged offense,
driving while license revoked or suspended, MCL
257.904(1), “without violating the Confrontation Clause. ”
People v Nunley, 491 Mich 686, 689-690 (2012).
Conversation with a family member. A witness’ s
testimony “about private conversations that she had wit h
her sister,” which “left the impression that [her sister,
who was unavailable to testify due to asserting the Fift h
Amendment,] admitted that she alone killed the victim or
that some man other than defendant was involved” were
not testimonial in nature of their context. People v Clark,
330 Mich App 392, 432-433 (2019).
Datamaster breath-test results. The admission of
Datamaster breath-test results did not violate the
defendant’s constitutional right of confrontation, because
“the original Datamaster ticket, showing the breath-tes t
procedures and defendant’s specific alcohol level, [did
not] amount[] to testimonial hearsay within the meanin g
of Crawford[, 541 US at 36].” People v Dinardo, 290 Mic h
App 280, 290 (2010). The Court held that “while the
Datamaster ticket showed facts relevant to the ultimate
issue of defendant’s guilt, the ticket was neither a
testimonial statement nor hearsay because it was not the
statement of a witness or a declarant.” Id. at 294. “Instead,
the Datamaster ticket was generated by a machine,
following an entirely automated process that did not rely
on any human input, data entry, or interpretation.” Id.
The Court directed that “[b]ecause the Datamaster ticke t
was not a testimonial hearsay statement, [the police
officer who administered the test] will be permitted t o
testify regarding the breath-test results [on remand].” Id.
Further, the Court directed that “because the
contemporaneously prepared [written report] constitute s
a recorded recollection pursuant to MRE 803(5), [the
officer] will be permitted to read its contents int o
evidence at trial [on remand].” Dinardo, 290 Mich App a t

Statements to a SANE. Statements made by a sexual
abuse victim to a SANE were nontestimonial because

complainant’s statements, an objective witness would
reasonably believe that the statements made to the nurse
objectively indicated that the primary purpose of the
questions or the examination was to meet an ongoing
emergency,” and “the circumstances did not reasonably
indicate to the victim that her statements to the nurse
would later be used in a prosecutorial manner agains t
defendant.” People v Garland, 286 Mich App 1, 11 (2009).
Specifically, because the victim did not have any
outwardly visible signs of physical trauma, “the victim' s
statements to the nurse were reasonably necessary for her
treatment and diagnosis[.]” Id.
Ongoing emergency. The lengthy sequence of events
following a 73-year-old victim’s rape and robbery
qualified as an ongoing emergency during which the
statements made by the victim (who died before trial)
constituted nontestimonial evidence. People v Jordan, 275
Mich App 659, 661-663 (2007). In Jordan, immediately afte r
the early morning assault, the victim ran out of her house
in her nightgown yelling for help. Id. at 661. The owner/
operator of a nearby service station responded to the
victim’s screams and called 911. Id. The police arrived 45
minutes later and although the victim told the service
station owner/operator that she had been raped, she
failed to tell the police about the rape when she wa s
initially questioned. Id. The victim’s friend arrived at the
scene after the police left, but the victim did not mentio n
the rape. Id. After learning of the rape by talking with th e
service station owner/operator, the friend took the victi m
to the police station where she told the police about the
rape. Id. at 661-662. “Because all statements by the victi m
were necessary to resolving the ongoing emergency, the
statements were nontestimonial.” Id. at 664-665.
3. Forfeiture By Wrongdoing
“[T]he forfeiture-by-wrongdoing rule, which is codified i n
MRE 804(b)(6), . . . provides that a statement is not excluded by
the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable and th e
statement is offered against a party that has engaged in o r
encouraged wrongdoing that was intended to, and did,
procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.” People
v Allen, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks an d
citation omitted) (noting “this forfeiture-by-wrongdoing rul e
also acts as an exception to a defendant’s right o f
confrontation”).
Page 3-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
“To admit evidence under MRE 804(b)(6), the prosecutio n
must show by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) th e
defendant engaged in or encouraged wrongdoing; (2) th e
wrongdoing was intended to procure the declarant’ s
unavailability; and (3) the wrongdoing did procure th e
unavailability.” Allen, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). In Allen, “defendant told [a romanti c
partner] during a phone conversation that she did not have t o
appear in court to testify even if she was subpoenaed.” Id. a t
___. Specifically, “in response to [her] mentioning . . . tha t
because she [had] not received a subpoena, she was not going
to attend the preliminary examination, defendant said, ‘Even i f
they did [serve her with a subpoena], do not go.’” Id. at ___ .
“And while it is true that [she] was never served with a
subpoena to appear at trial, defendant’s intent was patentl y
clear that he did not want [her] to appear at trial, which she di d
not.” Id. at ___. Because “it [was not] clearly erroneous for th e
trial court to conclude that defendant’s statement to [hi s
romantic partner] caused her to be unavailable for trial, ”
various out-of-court statements she made were properl y
admitted under MRE 804(b)(6) and read into the record at trial.
Id. at ___ (rejecting the defendant’s argument that his right t o
confrontation was violated when the trial court admitted th e
evidence under the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing rule”; “thi s
forfeiture-by-wrongdoing rule also acts as an exception to a
defendant’s right of confrontation”).
While the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrine provides a basi s
24
for a hearsay exception, it also is an exception to the right t o
confrontation; “the constitutional question will often go hand-
in-hand with the evidentiary question[.]” People v Burns, 49 4
Mich 104, 111, 114 (2013). “Insofar as it applies to the Sixt h
Amendment[‘s Confrontation Clause], . . . the forfeiture
doctrine requires that the defendant must have specificall y
intended that his wrongdoing would render the witnes s
unavailable to testify.” Id. at 111. The plain language of MRE
804(b)(6) incorporates this specific intent requirement. Burns,
494 Mich at 114.
The doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing does not apply t o
every case in which a defendant’s wrongful act has caused a
witness to be unavailable to testify at trial; rather, “th e
prosecution must show by a preponderance of the evidenc e
that: (1) the defendant engaged in or encouraged wrongdoing;
(2) the wrongdoing was intended to procure the declarant’ s
unavailability; and (3) the wrongdoing did procure th e

unavailability.” Burns, 494 Mich at 115 (2013) (holding tha t
evidence that “during the alleged [sexual] abuse defendan t
instructed [the child-victim] ‘not to tell’ anyone and warne d
her that if she told, she would ‘get in trouble’” did no t
25
“satisf[y] the causation element of MRE 804(b)(6)”). See als o
People v Roscoe, 303 Mich App 633, 640-641 (2014) (“[t]he trial
court’s admission of the victim’s . . . statement [identifying th e
defendant as his assailant] violated both the rules of evidenc e
and defendant’s right to confront the witness because the trial
court failed to make a factual finding that defendant had th e
requisite specific intent” to procure the witness’ s
unavailability; however, “because the erroneous admission o f
the evidence was not outcome determinative[ in light of ampl e
other evidence of the defendant’s guilt], reversal [was] no t
warranted”).
“[T]he trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting [ a
witness’s] prior statements under the forfeiture-by-
wrongdoing rule in MRE 804(b)(6),” where there wa s
“evidence of defendants’ . . . attempts to pressure [th e
witness], including: (1) visits from [co-defendant’s] relatives,
(2) shooting the windows of [the witness’s] home, and (3 )
assaults and intimidation of [the witness] in jail at the directio n
of [co-defendant] and [defendant].” People v Caddell, 332 Mic h
App 27, 68 (2020). Additionally, defendants’ “wrongdoin g
with regard to [the witness] occurred during the investigatio n
and prosecution of the case, which allowed a strong inferenc e
of intent to cause [the witness’s] unavailability.” Id.
Because the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrin e
“applies . . . when the defendant, or an intermediary, engage[] i n
conduct specifically designed to prevent a witness fro m
testifying,” the trial court’s admission of an unavailabl e
witness’s recorded interviews did not violate the defendant’ s
right of confrontation where the defendant conveyed to th e
witness a note containing “language that could be construed a s
threatening” and that “reflect[ed] an effort specificall y
designed to prevent [the witness] from testifying”). People v
McDade, 301 Mich App 343, 354-355 (2013) (emphasis added).
The decision to admit statements under the forfeiture-by-
wrongdoing rule is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, whil e
the trial court’s factual findings are reviewed for clear error.
Caddell, 332 Mich App at 66.
25 “Although not required by [the] court rules, . . . trial courts [should] make findings of fact on the recor d
for each of the three elements required by MRE 804(b)(6).” Burns, 494 Mich App at 118 n 42.
Page 3-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
4. Impeachment
An unavailable witness’s former testimonial statement may b e
admitted to impeach a witness without violating th e
Confrontation Clause according to Crawford v Washington, 54 1
US 36 (2004). People v McPherson, 263 Mich App 124, 134 (2004).
For example, in Tennessee v Street, 471 US 409, 411 (1985), th e
defendant testified in his own defense, claiming that hi s
confession was coerced and was derived from an accomplice’ s
testimony. The prosecution was allowed to introduce th e
accomplice’s testimony at trial, and the defendant argued tha t
his right of confrontation was violated because he did not hav e
the opportunity to cross-examine the accomplice. Id. at 410-
412. However, the United States Supreme Court held tha t
introduction of the accomplice’s confession “for the legitimate,
nonhearsay purpose of rebutting [the defendant’s] testimon y
that his own confession was a coerced ‘copy’ of [th e
accomplice’s] statement” did not violate the defendant’s righ t
of confrontation. Id. at 417. Similarly, in McPherson, 263 Mic h
App at 131, 134, the defendant argued that the admission of a n
accomplice’s statement that implicated the defendant (th e
testimony was elicited by the prosecutor from the defendan t
on cross-examination) violated his right of confrontation. Th e
Court concluded that because the prosecutor’s question wa s
intended to impeach the defendant’s statement that th e
accomplice was the gunman, its admission did not violate th e
defendant’s right of confrontation. Id. at 134.
The case of Hemphill v New York, 595 US ___, ___ (2022),
considered “whether the admission of [a] plea allocutio n
under New York’s rule in People v Reid[, 19 N. Y. 3d 382 (2012),]
violated [defendant’s] Sixth Amendment right to confront th e
witnesses against him.” “In Reid, New York’s highest cour t
held that a criminal defendant could open the door to evidenc e
that would otherwise be inadmissible under the Confrontatio n
Clause if the evidence was reasonably necessary to correct a
misleading impression made by the defense’s evidence o r
argument.” Hemphill, 595 US at ___ (cleaned up). Th e
defendant in Hemphill “pursued a third-party culpabilit y
defense by blaming [another individual] for the shooting” tha t
defendant was charged with. Id. at ___. Due to unavailability,
the State was allowed to introduce a transcript of the othe r
individual’s plea allocution to a separate charge pursuant t o
Reid upon a finding by the trial court that defendant had
opened the door to the evidence and “the evidence wa s
reasonably necessary to correct a misleading impression mad e
by the defense’s evidence and argument.” Hemphill, 595 US a t
___ (cleaned up).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-35
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Notably, the Court’s analysis in Hemphill focused on a New
York rule established in the Reid case, which is not binding
precedent in Michigan. The Hemphill Court acknowledged
“that the Sixth Amendment leaves States with flexibility t o
adopt reasonable procedural rules governing the exercise of a
defendant’s right to confrontation,” but it concluded that th e
door-opening principle established in Reid was “a substantiv e
principle of evidence that dictates what material is relevan t
and admissible in a case.” Hemphill, 595 US at ___. Because th e
Reid “principle requires a trial court to determine whether on e
party’s evidence and arguments, in the context of the full
record, have created a ‘misleading impression’ that require s
correction with additional material from the other side,” i t
violates Crawford and the “purpose of the Confrontatio n
Clause [to] bar judges from substituting their ow n
determinations of reliability for the method the Constitutio n
guarantees.” Hemphill, 595 US at ___. “The Confrontation
Clause requires that the reliability and veracity of the evidenc e
against a criminal defendant be tested by cross-examination,
not determined by the trial court.” Id. at ___ (concluding tha t
“[t]he trial court’s admission of unconfronted testimonial
hearsay [(under the Reid rule)] over [defendant’s] objection, on
the view that it was reasonably necessary to correc t
[defendant’s] misleading argument, violated that fundamenta l
26
guarantee”).
E. Joint Trial Issues
1. Scope of Testimony
A defendant’s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation i s
violated when his or her nontestifying codefendant’ s
statements—which implicate the defendant—are introduced a t
their joint trial. Bruton v United States, 391 US 123, 126 (1968) .
This is referred to as a Bruton error. However, the admissibility
of an unavailable codefendant’s nontestimonial statement agains t
27
interest is governed by MRE 804(b)(4) (hearsay exception fo r
statements against the declarant’s interest), not th e
Confrontation Clause. People v Taylor, 482 Mich 368, 370 (2008),
26The Court further dismissed the State’s assertion “that the Reid rule is necessary to safeguard the truth-
finding function of courts because it prevents the selective and misleading introduction of evidence, ”
noting that “[e]ven as it has recognized and reaffirmed the vital truth-seeking function of a trial, the Court
has not allowed such considerations to override the rights the Constitution confers upon crimina l
defendants,” nor has the Court “held that defendants can ‘open the door’ to violations of constitutiona l
requirements merely by making evidence relevant to contradict their defense.” Hemphill, 595 US at ___.
27The provision previously found in MRE 804(b)(3) now appears in MRE 804(b)(4). See ADM File No. 2021-
10, effective January 1, 2024.
Page 3-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
overruling People v Poole, 444 Mich 151 (1993), to the extent tha t
Poole held that this type of statement is governed by both MRE
28
804(b)(4) and the Confrontation Clause. See Chapter 5 fo r
more information on hearsay exceptions.
A Bruton error is an error of constitutional magnitude subjec t
to harmless error analysis; it does not require automati c
reversal of a defendant’s conviction. People v Pipes, 475 Mic h
267, 276-277 (2006). Where a Bruton error is unpreserved, it is
subject to review for “‘plain error that affected substantial
rights.’” Pipes, 475 Mich at 278, quoting People v Carines, 46 0
Mich 750, 774 (1999). Under this standard, even where a
nontestifying codefendant’s statement was improperl y
admitted at a joint trial, the other codefendant’s self-
incriminating statement may be properly admitted against tha t
codefendant and may be considered to determine whether th e
error was harmless. Pipes, 475 Mich at 280.
2. Curing Defects
“Joint trials with a single jury present a special problem ”
because “[s]ome evidence may be admissible as to on e
defendant but violate a codefendant’s confrontation right” i f
the evidence is testimonial. People v Bruner, 501 Mich 220, 227
(2018). “When that is the case, a court must either exclude th e
testimony or take measures to eliminate the confrontatio n
problem.” Id. “What measures are sufficient depends on th e
context and content of the evidence.” Id. “If, for example, a
witness’s testimony can be redacted to eliminate reference t o
the codefendant’s existence, that witness will not have born e
testimony against the codefendant in any Sixth Amendmen t
sense.” Id. at 227-228. However, merely redacting the
codefendant’s name and replacing it with a blank, the ter m
“deleted,” or some other symbol still points too directly at a
jointly tried codefendant and violates the Confrontatio n
Clause. Gray v Maryland, 523 US 185, 192 (1998); Bruner, 50 1
Mich at 228 n 2.
Sometimes the court can avoid a Sixth Amendment violatio n
“by instructing the jury to consider testimony against on e
defendant, but not the other.” Bruner, 501 Mich at 228. “Since
[courts] presume juries follow their instructions, the result of a

instruction.” Id. “[L]imiting instructions are categorically
inadequate to protect against evidence that a nontestifyin g
defendant confessed and implicated a codefendant in tha t
confession.” Id. “In such a case, the confrontation proble m
persists as if no instruction had been given at all.” Id.
In Bruner, “the admission at a joint trial with a single jury of a n
unavailable witness’s prior testimony about a codefendant’ s
confession violated the defendant’s constitutional right t o
confrontation, notwithstanding the redaction of th e
defendant’s name and the reading of a limiting instruction t o
the jury.” Bruner, 501 Mich at 223. “The defendant had n o
opportunity to cross-examine the witness, and because of th e
substance of the witness’s testimony—the codefendant’ s
confession that implicated the defendant—was so powerfull y
incriminating, the limiting instruction and redaction wer e
ineffective to cure the Confrontation Clause violation.” Id.
(reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
remanding for consideration of whether the prosecutio n
established that the error was harmless beyond a reasonabl e
doubt).
The Confrontation Clause “does not provide a freestandin g
guarantee against the risk of potential prejudice that may aris e
inferentially in a joint trial.” Samia v United States, 599 US ___,
___ (2023). In Samia, the Court concluded that th e
Confrontation Clause does not bar “the admission of a
nontestifying codefendant’s confession where (1) th e
confession has been modified to avoid directly identifying th e
nonconfessing codefendant and (2) the court offers a limitin g
instruction that jurors may consider the confession only wit h
respect to the confessing codefendant.” Id. at ___. The United
States Supreme Court “precedents distinguish betwee n
confessions that directly implicate a defendant and those tha t
do so indirectly.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, “the Clause was no t
violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant’ s
confession that did not directly inculpate the defendant an d
was subject to a proper limiting instruction.” Id. at ___ (notin g
it would not have been feasible to further modify th e
nontestifying codefendant’s confession to make it appear tha t
he had acted alone).
Committee Tip:
Bruner issues are often complex and demanding
of intricate analysis. If possible, they are best

determined before trial. The court shoul d
address these issues in that fashion if practical.
F. Interpreters and the Language Conduit Rule
Under the “language conduit” rule, “an interpreter is considered a n
agent of the declarant, not an additional declarant, and the
interpreter’s statements are regarded as the statements of the
declarant without creating an additional layer of hearsay”; thus,
where a defendant has a full opportunity to cross-examine the
declarant, he or she has no additional constitutional right t o
confront the interpreter. People v Jackson, 292 Mich App 583, 595-597
(2011). In Jackson, 292 Mich App at 587, 593-594, a hospitalized
shooting victim was questioned by a police officer. Because the
victim was unable to speak at the time of the interview, he answered
the questions by either squeezing the hand of an attending nurse (t o
indicate “yes”) or not (to indicate “no”). Id. at 593-594. The Cour t
stated that the following factors should be examined whe n
determining whether statements made through an interpreter are
admissible under the language conduit rule:
“(1) whether actions taken after the conversation wer e
consistent with the statements translated, (2) th e
interpreter’s qualifications and language skill, (3 )
whether the interpreter had any motive to mislead o r
distort, and (4) which party supplied the interpreter. ”
Jackson, 292 Mich App at 596.
Concluding that none of these factors militated against applicatio n
of the language conduit rule, the Court held that although the
victim’s nonverbal answers qualified as testimonial statements, the
defendant did not have a constitutional right to confront the nurse,
“because what she was reporting were the statements actually made
by [the victim].” Jackson, 292 Mich App at 596-597. Because he “had
a full opportunity to cross-examine” the victim, the defendant’ s
Confrontation Clause rights were satisfied. Id. at 597.
G. Taking Testimony by Use of Audio and Video Technology
1. Use of Videoconferencing Technology in Certain
Proceedings
Except as otherwise provided in MCR 2.407, the use of
videoconferencing in criminal proceedings is governed b y
MCR 6.006. MCR 6.006(A)(1). “The use of telephonic, voice,
videoconferencing, or two-way interactive video technology,
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-39
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
must be in accordance with any requirements and guideline s
established by the State Court Administrative Office, and all
proceedings at which such technology is used must b e
recorded verbatim by the court. MCR 6.006(D).
A court may allow the use of videoconferencing technology by
any participant in any criminal proceeding, at the request of any
participant, or sua sponte. MCR 6.006(A)(2). The court mus t
“consider constitutional requirements, in addition to the factor s
contained in MCR 2.407,” “[w]hen determining whether t o
utilize videoconferencing technology.” MCR 6.006(A)(3). See
also M Crim JI 5.16, which addresses witness testimony
introduced via video rather than in-person:
“The next witness, [identify witness], will testify b y
videoconferencing technology. You are to judge the
witness’s testimony by the same standards as any
other witness, and you should give the witness’ s
testimony the same consideration you would have
given it had the witness testified in person. If yo u
cannot hear something that is said or if you have
any difficulty observing the witness on the
videoconferencing screen, please raise your hand
immediately.”
MCR 6.006 “does not supersede a participant’s ability t o
participate by telephonic means under MCR 2.402.” MCR
6.006(A)(4).
Cases cognizable in the circuit court. Videoconferencing may
be used in circuit court to conduct any non-evidentiary or tria l
proceeding. MCR 6.006(B)(1). The use of videoconferencing is
the preferred mode for:
“(a) initial arraignments on the information;
(b) pretrial conferences;
(c) motions pursuant to MCR 2.119; and
(d) pleas.” MCR 6.006(B)(2).
It is presumed that parties, witnesses, and other participants will
appear in-person for all other proceedings. MCR 6.006(B)(3). The
use of videoconferencing may not be used in bench or jury trials,
or any proceeding where the testimony of witnesses or evidence
may be presented, “except in the discretion of the court after all
parties have had notice and an opportunity to be heard on the
use of videoconferencing technology.” MCR 6.006(B)(4).
Page 3-40 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.5
MCR 6.006 does not prevent “a defendant who otherwise ha s
the right to appear in person, from demanding to physicall y
appear in person for any proceeding.” MCR 6.006(B)(5). The
presiding judge and any attorney of record for the participan t
must appear in person with the participant if “there is a
demand to appear in person, or a participant is found to b e
unable to adequately use the technology, to hear or understan d
or be heard or understood[.]” Id.
Cases cognizable in district and municipal courts.
Videoconferencing is the “preferred mode for conducting
arraignments and probable cause conferences for in-custody
defendants.” MCR 6.006(C)(1). It is presumed that parties,
witnesses, and other participants will appear in-persona for all
other criminal proceedings. MCR 6.006(C)(2).
“Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules and
subject to constitutional rights, the use of videoconferencin g
technology shall not be used in evidentiary hearings, benc h
trials or jury trials, or any criminal proceeding wherein th e
testimony of witnesses or presentation of evidence may occur,
except in the discretion of the court.” MCR 6.006(C)(3). Distric t
courts may use videoconferencing to take testimony from an y
witness in a preliminary examination if the defendant is eithe r
present in the courtroom or has waived the right to be present,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary. MCR
6.006(C)(4).
The following cases address the use of two-way interactiv e
video technology before MCR 6.006(E) was added to the cour t
rule and prior to complete replacement of MCR 6.006(A)-(C).
See ADM File No. 2020-08, effective September 1, 2022. It i s
unclear if any of the Courts’ analyses would be impacted b y
the addition of the new subrule and rewording of MCR
6.006(A)-(C).
“In allowing [a forensic analyst’s] two-way, interactive vide o
testimony [at trial] over the defendant’s objection, the trial
court violated the defendant’s Confrontation Clause rights ”
and MCR 6.006(C). People v Jemison (Jemison I), 505 Mich 352,
366-367 n 9 (2020) (vacating the Court of Appeals analysis tha t
“the MCR 6.006(C) error [was] interchangeable with a
Confrontation Clause violation”).
Where the defendant failed to object on the record to the use o f
two-way interactive video technology to present the testimon y
of an examining physician and a DNA expert, and wher e
defense counsel stated that she would leave the issue of th e
admission of the video testimony to the trial court’s discretion,
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-41
Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
the defendant waived his constitutional right of confrontatio n
and “consent[ed]” to the use of the video technology withi n
29
the meaning of MCR 6.006(C)(2). People v Buie, 491 Mich 294,
297-298, 316, 318-319 (2012). For additional information o n
waiver, see Section 3.5(I).
Turning to MCR 6.006(C), the Buie Court concluded that th e
defendant “consent[ed]” to the video testimony within th e
meaning of MCR 6.006(C)(2) and that the trial court did no t
abuse its discretion in finding that “good cause” was show n
for the use of video technology. Buie, 491 Mich at 318-320. “[I]f
either the defendant or [defense] counsel objects, the ‘party ’
cannot be said to have consented[ under MCR 6.006(C)(2);
h]owever, as with the Confrontation Clause, for th e
defendant’s objection to be valid, it must be made on th e
record.” Buie, 491 Mich at 319. Additionally, contrary to th e
defendant’s argument, the Court held that “the use of ‘good
cause’ in MCR 6.006(C) [does not] import[] the constitutional
standard from [Maryland v Craig, 497 US 836, 845-846, 850-852
(1990),] for dispensing with confrontation, to wit, that th e
‘cause’ be ‘necessary to further an important public policy’ o r
‘state interest’”; rather, video testimony may be admitte d
under MCR 6.006(C) if there is “a satisfactory, sound or valid
reason,” and “there is no need to identify a corresponding stat e
interest[.]” Buie, 491 Mich at 319 (quotation marks and citation
omitted). Because “both parties apparently consented to th e
use of video testimony, the trial court did not [abuse it s
discretion] by concluding that convenience, cost, and efficienc y
were sound reasons for using video testimony.” Id. at 320.
A trial court’s decision to admit video testimony under MCR
6.006(C) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Buie, 491 Mic h
at 319-320.
2. Expert Testimony
MCL 600.2164a(1) specifically permits the use of vide o
communication equipment for the purpose of presentin g
expert testimony at trial. If the court determines “that exper t
testimony will assist the trier of fact and that a witness i s
qualified to give the expert testimony,” and if all the partie s
consent, the court may allow a qualified expert witness “to b e
sworn and testify at trial by video communication equipmen t
that permits all the individuals appearing or participating t o
29 Effective January 1, 2017, ADM File No. 2013-18 amended MCR 6.006(C) to refer to “videoconferencing
technology” rather than “two-way interactive video technology[.]” Effective September 1, 2022, ADM Fil e
No. 2020-08 replaced the language of former MCR 6.006(C).

“In allowing [a forensic analyst’s] two-way, interactive vide o
testimony [at trial] over the defendant’s objection, the trial
court violated the defendant’s Confrontation Clause rights. ”

3. Special Protections for Certain Victim-Witnesses
MCL 600.2163a affords certain victim-witnesses special
protections in prosecutions and proceedings involvin g
32
specified offenses. MCL 600.2163a(1)(g). These specia l
protections include the use of videorecorded statements o r
closed-circuit television in presenting the victim-witness’ s
33
testimony. See MCL 600.2163a(8); MCL 600.2163a(20).
In prosecutions of adult offenders, a videorecorded statemen t
may be used in court only for one or more of the following
purposes:
“(a) It may be admitted as evidence at all pretrial
proceedings, except that it cannot be introduced a t
the preliminary examination instead of the live
testimony of the witness.
(b) It may be admitted for impeachment purposes.
(c) It may be considered by the court i n
determining the sentence.
(d) It may be used as a factual basis for a no contes t
plea or to supplement a guilty plea.” MCL
34
600.2163a(8).
“A videorecorded deposition may be considered in cour t
proceedings only as provided by law.” MCL 600.2163a(9).
“If, upon the motion of a party or in the court’s discretion, th e
court finds on the record that the witness is or will b e
30 See Section 4.1(C) for additional discussion of expert testimony via video communication equipment.
31 See Section 3.6 for discussion of child witnesses. For additional discussion of special protections fo r
certain victims and witnesses, see the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Sexual Assault Benchbook, Chapter 5.
32 Section 17b of the Juvenile Code, MCL 712A.17b, affords similar protections, but does not apply to
vulnerable adults. See MCL 712A.17b(1)(e).
33 See also MCL 712A.17b(5); MCL 712A.17b(16).
34 In juvenile proceedings, a videorecorded statement “shall be admitted at all proceedings except the
adjudication stage instead of the live testimony of the witness.” MCL 712A.17b(5).

Section 3.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
psychologically or emotionally unable to testify at a cour t
proceeding even with the benefit of the protections afforded
the witness in subsections [MCL 600.2163a](3), [MCL
600.2163a](4), [MCL 600.2163a](17), and [MCL
[35]
600.2163a](19), the court must order that the witness may
testify outside the physical presence of the defendant by closed
circuit television or other electronic means that allows th e
witness to be observed by the trier of fact and the defendan t
when questioned by the parties.” MCL 600.2163a(20). See als o
MCL 712A.17b(16), which contains substantially similar
language and is applicable during the adjudication stage of a
juvenile proceeding.
H. Use of Support Person or Support Animal
“The court must permit a witness who is called upon to testify t o
have a support person sit with, accompany, or be in close proximity
to the witness during his or her testimony.” MCL 600.2163a(4). Note
that the definition of witness is limited to certain child witnesses,
witnesses with a developmental disability, and vulnerable adults.
See MCL 600.2163a(1)(g). “The court must also permit a witnes s
who is called upon to testify to have a courtroom support dog and
handler sit with, or be in close proximity to, the witness during hi s
or her testimony.” Id.
“A notice of intent to use a support person or courtroom suppor t
dog is only required if the support person or courtroom suppor t
dog is to be utilized during trial and is not required for the use of a
support person or courtroom support dog during any other
courtroom proceeding.” MCL 600.2163a(5). “A notice o f
intent . . . must be filed with the court and must be served upon all
parties to the proceeding,” and “[t]he notice must name the suppor t
person or courtroom support dog, identify the relationship the
support person has with the witness, if applicable, and give notice
to all parties that the witness may request that the named suppor t
person or courtroom support dog sit with the witness when the
witness is called upon to testify during trial.” Id.
“A court must rule on a motion objecting to the use of a named
support person or courtroom support dog before the date when the
witness desires to use the support person or courtroom suppor t
dog.” MCL 600.2163a(5). “[I]t is within the trial court’s inheren t
authority to control its courtroom and the proceedings before it t o
35 These subsections allow, under limited circumstances, the use of dolls or mannequins, the presence of a
support person, the presence of a courtroom support dog (and the dog’s handler), the exclusion of all
unnecessary persons from the courtroom, and the placement of the defendant as far from the witnes s
stand as is reasonable. MCL 712A.17b contains similar provisions.

allow a witness to testify accompanied by a support animal.” People
v Johnson, 315 Mich App 163, 178 (2016), citing MCL 768.29; MRE
36
611(a). A trial court is not required to make findings of good cause
or necessity before allowing the use of a support animal. Johnson,
315 Mich App at 187. However, “as a practical matter it will be the
better practice for a trial court to make some findings regarding a
decision to use or not use a support animal,” and “the court should
consider the facts and circumstances of each individual witness t o
determine whether the use of the support animal will be useful t o
the expeditious and effective ascertainment of the truth.” Id. at 187 ,
189.
The use of a support dog to accompany a young victim of sexual
abuse and another young witness (the victim’s brother) when they
testified “did not implicate the Confrontation Clause because it did
not deny defendant a face-to-face confrontation with his accuser[.]”
Johnson, 315 Mich App at 187 (noting that “the victim and the
victim’s brother testified on the witness stand withou t
obstruction, . . . the presence of the dog did not affect the witnesses ’
competency to testify[ or] . . . the oath or affirmation given to the
witnesses, the witnesses were still subject to cross-examination, and
the trier of fact was still afforded the unfettered opportunity t o
observe the witnesses’ demeanor”).
“[A] fully abled adult witness may not be accompanied by a
support animal or support person while testifying.” People v Shorter,
37
324 Mich App 529, 542 (2018). “[T]here is a fundamental difference
between allowing a support animal to accompany a child witness,
as in Johnson, and allowing the animal to accompany a fully abled
adult witness[.]” Id. at 538.
I. Waiver
“The Confrontation Clauses of our state and federal constitution s
provide that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused has the righ t
to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” People v Buie, 491
Mich 294, 304 (2012). However, “[t]here is no doubt that the right of
confrontation may be waived and that waiver may be accomplished
by counsel.” Id. at 306.
In Buie, the defendant failed to object on the record to the use of
38
two-way interactive video technology to present the testimony of
an examining physician and a DNA expert, and defense counsel
36The Johnson case was decided before 2018 PA 282, which amended MCL 600.2163a(4) to include the use
of a courtroom support dog.
37The Shorter case was decided before 2018 PA 282, which amended MCL 600.2163a(4) to include the use
of a courtroom support dog.

stated that she would leave the issue of the admission of the vide o
testimony to the trial court’s discretion. Buie, 491 Mich at 297-298,
316. The Michigan Supreme Court held that, under thes e
circumstances, the defendant had waived his right of confrontatio n
under the state and federal constitutions. Id. at 297, 310-318.
“[W]here the decision constitutes reasonable trial strategy, which i s
presumed, the right of confrontation may be waived by defense
counsel as long as the defendant does not object on the record.” Id.
at 313. Although defense counsel stated at trial that the defendan t
“‘wanted to question the veracity of these proceedings,’” tha t
statement did not constitute an objection because (1) it was no t
phrased as an objection, (2) the defendant effectively acquiesced t o
the use of two-way interactive technology when his counsel stated
that she would leave it to the court’s discretion whether to use the
technology, (3) the defendant made no complaints on the record
when the court proceeded to explain how the technology worked,
(4) the first remote witness testified via two-way interactive
technology without further complaint, and (5) there was n o
complaint made before the testimony of the second remote witness.
39
Id. at 316-317.
Committee Tip:
It may be advisable for the court to formalize
counsel’s unknown position by asking “are you
objecting or aren’t you?”
J. Standard of Review
Whether a defendant has been denied his or her right t o
confrontation is a constitutional question reviewed de novo o n
appeal. People v Beasley, 239 Mich App 548, 557 (2000). “[T]he trial
court’s factual findings [are reviewed] for clear error.” People v Buie,
491 Mich 294, 304 (2012). Preserved Confrontation Clause violation s
are subject to harmless-error analysis. See Delaware v Van Arsdall, 47 5
US 673, 682 (1986). Unpreserved Confrontation Clause violation s
38 Effective January 1, 2017, ADM File No. 2013-18 amended MCR 6.006(C) to refer to “videoconferencing

No. 2020-08 replaced the language of former MCR 6.006(C).
39 The Buie Court additionally held that, under these circumstances, the defendant “consent[ed]” to the
use of the video technology within the meaning of MCR 6.006(C)(2). Buie, 491 Mich at 318-320. Effectiv e

are subject to review for “‘plain error that affected substantial
rights.’” People v Pipes, 475 Mich 267, 278 (2006), quoting People v
Carines, 460 Mich 750, 774 (1999).
Committee Tip:
Care should be taken to ensure counsel
articulates the basis for any objection: i.e,
confrontation violation, rules of evidence, or
under the court rules.
3.6 Child Witness
A. Competency
A child is competent to testify as a witness unless “the court finds,
after questioning, that the [child] does not have sufficient physical
or mental capacity or sense of obligation to testify truthfully or
understandably; or [the MREs] provide otherwise.” MRE 601. “For a
witness who is a [young] child, a promise to tell the truth takes the
place of an oath to tell the truth.” M Crim JI 5.9.
B. Sexual Act Evidence
In criminal and delinquency proceedings only, a child’s (declarant)
statement describing sexual acts performed on or with the
defendant or accomplice is admissible, if it corroborates th e
declarant’s testimony during the same proceeding and:
“(1) the declarant was under the age of ten when th e
statement was made;
(2) the statement is shown to have been spontaneou s
and without indication of manufacture;
(3) either the declarant made the statement immediatel y
after the incident or any delay is excusable as havin g
been caused by fear or other equally effectiv e
circumstance;
(4) the statement is introduced through the testimony o f
someone other than the declarant; and
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-47
Section 3.6 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(5) the proponent of the statement makes known to th e
adverse party the intent to offer it and its particular s
sufficiently before the trial or hearing to provide th e
adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to mee t
40
it.” MRE 803A(1)–(5).
Only the declarant’s first corroborative statement is admissible
under MRE 803A. However, a statement that is inadmissible under
MRE 803A because it is a subsequent corroborative statement is no t
precluded from being admitted via another hearsay exception.
People v Katt, 468 Mich 272, 294-297 (2003) (finding that th e
41
statement was admissible under the residual hearsay exception).
C. Custody Proceedings
In camera interview to determine child’s reasonable preference.
The scope of an in camera interview of a child is limited t o
determining the child’s preference and should not cover other bes t
interest of the child factors. In re HRC, 286 Mich App 444, 451-45 2
(2009). MCR 3.210(C)(5) provides:
“The court may interview the child privately t o
determine if the child is of sufficient age to express a
preference regarding custody, and, if so, the reasonabl e
preference of the child. The court shall focus th e
interview on these determinations, and the informatio n
received shall be applied only to the reasonabl e
preference factor.”
“‘The purpose behind this practice is to reduce the emotional
trauma felt by a child required to testify in open court or in front of
his or her parents, and to relieve the child of having to openly
choose sides.’” Atherton v Atherton, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025),
quoting In re HRC, 286 Mich App at 451. “Although the judge i s
limited in his or her line of questioning, the rules of evidence do no t
apply.” Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up); see also MRE
1101(b)(6) (providing that the rules of evidence do not apply to i n
camera proceedings regarding a child’s custodial preference).
40 See also MCR 3.972(C), which applies to child protective proceedings and contains a rule similar to MR E
803A; In re Boshell/Shelton, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (“Though MCR 3.972(C)(2) provides an
exception for the admission at trial of a child’s hearsay statements about abuse, the trial court never hel d
the requisite hearing to determine whether the circumstances surrounding [the child’s] forensic interview
had adequate indicia of trustworthiness, such that her statements could be admitted under MCR
3.972(C)(2).”).
41Provisions previously found in MRE 803(24) now appear in MRE 807. See ADM File No. 2021-10, effectiv e
January 1, 2024.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.6
In Atherton, “the trial court felt compelled to act swiftly because the
information gathered during the in camera interview involved a n
alarming allegation that defendant had threatened plaintiff’s life.”
Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___. Accordingly, “the trial court grante d
plaintiff sole physical custody of the minor children by completely
suspending defendant’s parenting time.” Id. at ___. However, “the
trial court committed clear legal error by suspending defendant’ s
parenting time, based solely on information gathered at an in camera
interview, without conducting an evidentiary hearing.” Id. at __ _
(“A hearing is required before custody can be changed even on a
temporary basis.”) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Th e
trial court’s . . . order stated that suspension of defendant’s
parenting time was in the minor children’s best interests, but thi s
finding was based only on information gathered during the i n
camera interview, where ‘the information received shall be applied
only to the reasonable preference factor.’” Id. at ___, quoting MCR
3.210(C)(5). “The trial court effectively changed physical custod y
without making findings regarding: (1) whether the change would
alter an established custodial environment, which was necessary t o
establish the burden of proof; and (2) applying the appropriate
burden of proof, whether modification was in the children’s bes t
interests.” Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___. “‘A court’s concern for a
child’s well-being in a custody proceeding, however, must no t
outweigh considerations of fundamental fairness in proceeding s
that affect parental rights.’” Id. at ___, quoting In re HRC, 286 Mic h
App at 452. “When a trial court believes that there is a threat o f
imminent harm, including when information is initially learned i n
an in camera interview, MCR 3.207 provides a legal framework fo r
immediate suspension of custody.” Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___
(“But where, as here, the trial court has not complied with the
evidentiary and procedural requirements of MCR 3.207, we canno t
countenance its decision to suspend parenting time in such a way a s
to effect a change in custody without an evidentiary hearing.”).

Due process considerations. “Questioning in an in camera
interview does not constitute a due process violation as long as the
interview is limited to the child’s parental preferences.” Atherton,
___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up). “Regarding issues other than th e
child’s preference, a trial court must take testimony in open cour t
because to allow courts to discuss such matters during the in camera
interview would constitute a due process violation.” Id. at ___
(cleaned up). Indeed, “use of an in camera interview for fact-finding
presents multiple due process problems should questions or
answers arise concerning disputed facts unrelated to the child’ s
preference.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Merely determining a child’ s

reasonable preference—one of the 12 best-interest factors under
MCL 722.23—is not the kind of fact-finding inquiry that require s
credibility assessments, weighing evidence, resolving factual
conflicts, or robust appellate review.” Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___.
“By contrast, other factors bearing on a child’s best interests ofte n
involve deeply contested factual disputes that cannot be fairly and
reliably resolved behind closed doors, outside the crucible of cross-
examination, and with no opportunity to present evidence or create
a record for appeal.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, a “‘trial court must take
testimony in open court on issues of abuse or mistreatment because
to allow courts to discuss such matters during the in camera
interview would constitute a due process violation.’” Id. at ___ ,
quoting Surman v Surman, 277 Mich App 287, 302 (2007) (stating
“although courts should seek to avoid subjecting children to the
distress and trauma resulting from testifying and being cross-
examined in court, concerns over the child’s welfare are outweighed
when balanced against a parent’s due process rights”).
In Atherton, “the primary basis for the trial court’s decision t o
suspend parenting time was not the children’s reasonable parental
preferences but rather the trial court’s independent determinatio n
that defendant had made a statement threatening plaintiff’s life.”
Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___. “Although the in camera interview
permitted under MCR 3.210(C)(5) provides a useful opportunity for
the trial court to consider a child’s reasonable preference whe n
determining their best interests, it is not a substitute for a n
evidentiary hearing on disputed and potentially outcome-
determinative questions of fact about who said what to whom.”
Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___. “The trial court committed clear lega l
error by suspending defendant’s parenting time, effectively
modifying physical custody, based solely on information gathered
during an in camera interview, without holding an evidentiary
hearing, making required findings, or complying with the
requirements of MCR 3.207.” Atherton, ___ Mich App at ___.
3.7 Credibility of Witness
“A witness has the duty to testify truthfully to the best of his or he r
ability, and the factfinder (whether judge or jury) has the correspondin g
duty to assess the credibility of that witness and evaluate the weight, i f
any, to give to that witness’s testimony.” People v Rohm, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2025). “In a court of law, no witness has a free-standing ‘right t o
be believed’ by the finder of fact.” Id. at ___. “If such a right existed, the n
it would be incumbent on the jury to accept such testimony, both in term s
of credibility and weight.” Id. at ___. “But this would go directly agains t
the oft-recognized principle that ‘a jury is free to believe or disbelieve, i n
whole or in part, any of the evidence presented.’” Id. at ___, quoting
Page 3-50 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.7
People v Perry, 460 Mich 55, 63 (1999). “A free-standing notion of the ‘righ t
to be believed’ is antithetical to the rule of law, as it would require Lad y
Justice to slip the blind from one eye and tilt the scale of justice in favor o f
one witness to the detriment of all others.” Rohm, ___ Mich App at __ _
(“It was wrong for the prosecutor to assert such a right during closing i n
defendant’s criminal trial.”).“Simply put, no witness begins testifying
with a built-in advantage under the law.” Id. at ___.
“The prosecutor can argue that a witness should be believed but canno t
appeal to the jury to sympathize with the witness.” Id. at ___. In Rohm,
“[d]uring closing, the prosecutor asserted that it was awful for [th e
victim] to have to testify and that children like [the victim] would no t
fabricate allegations of sexual abuse.” Id. at ___. “Such comments ar e
better viewed as attempts to bolster credibility based on a juror’ s
commonsense judgment, as opposed to impermissible vouching based
on a prosecutor’s special knowledge.” Id. at ___. “These comments di d
not invade or otherwise undermine the province of the jury as the final
judge of the credibility and weight of [the victim’s] testimony.” Id. at ___.
“Similarly, these comments were not so shocking as to inflame the jur y
and thereby prejudice defendant.” Id. at ___.
“Generally, it is the province of the jury to determine the credibility of th e
witnesses before it.” People v Butsinas, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025).
“Consequently, it is improper for a witness or an expert to comment o r
provide an opinion on the credibility of another person while testifyin g
at trial.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly ,
“a witness cannot comment on or provide an opinion regarding th e
credibility of another witness.” Id. at ___. “A witness’s commentar y
regarding the credibility of another witness has no probative valu e
because it does nothing to assist the jury in determining a witness’ s
credibility in relation to its fact-finding mission and its ultimat e
assessment of guilt.” Id. at ___.
In criminal cases, “it is improper for a witness or an expert to comment o r
provide an opinion on the credibility of another person while testifyin g
at trial” because “‘jurors [are] the judges of the credibility of testimon y
offered by witnesses.’” People v Musser, 494 Mich 337, 348-349 (2013),
quoting United States v Bailey, 444 US 394, 414 (1980). “Such comment s
have no probative value, because they do nothing to assist the jury i n
assessing witness credibility in its fact-finding mission and i n
determining the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.” Musser, 494 Mich a t
349 (quotation marks and citations omitted).
“While a prosecutor may not ask a defendant to comment on th e
credibility of a witness, it is not improper for a prosecutor to ask th e
defendant which facts he disputes.” People v Allen, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025). However, “it is not proper for a prosecutor to ask a defendant t o
comment on the credibility of prosecution witnesses since a defendant’ s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-51
Section 3.7 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
opinion on such a matter is not probative and credibility determination s
are to be made by the trier of fact.” Allen, ___ Mich App at, ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). In Allen, “[t]he questions posed t o
defendant had no purpose other than to determine whether defendan t
believed the witnesses were lying about their version of events.” Id. a t
___ (observing “that not only were these questions irrelevant, they had
the tendency to lower the burden of proof in favor of the prosecutor”).
The Allen Court held that “such a determination is properly left to the
jury, and asking defendant to comment on the witnesses’ credibilit y
usurped the jury’s role as factfinder.” Id. at ___.
“The prosecutor cannot vouch for the credibility of his witnesses to th e
effect that he has some special knowledge concerning a witness ’
truthfulness.” People v Skippergosh, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned
up). “But a prosecutor may comment on his own witnesses’ credibility
during closing argument, especially when there is conflicting evidenc e
and the question of the defendant’s guilt depends on which witnesses th e
jury believes.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). The
Skippergosh Court held that “in light of the testimony presented at trial, i t
was reasonable for the prosecution to infer and argue that . . . famil y
members did not have any unusual or impermissible motivations fo r
testifying, and that they were compelled to do so simply out o f
commonplace concern for the well-being of a family member.” Id. at __ _
(further noting that “nothing in the prosecution’s closing
argument . . . hint[ed] at having special knowledge of the family
members’ truthfulness or reasons for testifying”).
The jury is permitted to infer that a defendant’s implausible testimony i s
evidence of guilt. Id. at ___ (“As the trier of fact, the jury was entitled t o
disbelieve the defendant’s uncorroborated and confused testimony. And
if the jury did disbelieve the defendant, it was further entitled to conside r
whatever it concluded to be perjured testimony as affirmative evidenc e
of guilt.”) (cleaned up). In Skippergosh, the evidence presented at trial was
sufficient to show the defendant committed an assault and batter y
against the victim. Id. at ___. In addition to testimony from the victim’ s
family members and neighbors, the defendant “provided implausibl e
testimony to explain away . . . two assaults and the circumstance s
surrounding them.” Id. at ___. “For example, [the defendant] testified
that the January 2020 assault against [the victim] was committed by fou r
anonymous women in the living room while they were covering his eyes,
and that [the victim] was screaming for help in December 2021 becaus e
she required assistance removing taco meat from the refrigerator.” Id. a t
___ (noting that the trial court, during sentencing, characterized th e
defendant’s testimony as “almost laughable in terms of what you tried t o
convince the jury actually happened”). “Accordingly, the evidence wa s
sufficient to establish that [the defendant] was guilty of domesti c
violence beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at ___.
Page 3-52 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.7
“Agreements for testimony are relevant to assessing a witness’ s
credibility.” People v Bryson, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “The jury’ s
estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well b e
determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors a s
the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant’ s
life or liberty may depend.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). In Bryson, “the prosecution failed to disclose the full terms of a n
accomplice witness’s agreement for testimony . . . .” Id. at ___. The
accomplice “testified that he agreed to cooperate and testify for th e
prosecution in exchange for pleading guilty to a lesser charge.” Id. at ___.
“While not paid monetarily for his cooperation, [the accomplice] wa s
nonetheless rewarded with the opportunity to plead guilty to a lesse r
charge.” Id. at ___. “And in reality, he was rewarded with a complet e
dismissal of all charges.” Id. at ___. “It was essential to the jury’ s
determination of [the accomplice’s] credibility to know the fact s
surrounding his agreement to testify.” Id. at ___. “After hearing that [the
accomplice] had already pleaded guilty and served a sentence for hi s
involvement in the home invasion, the jury may have believed that [th e
accomplice] did not have a motive to fabricate his testimony because h e
had already served his sentence.” Id. at ___. “The jury may have give n
[the accomplice] undue credibility based on the uncorrected fals e
testimony.” Id. at ___. “Because the false testimony concerned [th e
accomplice’s] agreement to testify, the prosecutor had an affirmative dut y
to specifically correct his testimony regarding that agreement.” Id. at ___.
“Absent exceptional circumstances, issues of witness credibility are fo r
the jury, and the trial court may not substitute its view of the credibilit y
for the constitutionally guaranteed jury determination thereof.” People v
Knepper, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up). “‘Conflicting
testimony, even when impeached to some extent, is an insufficien t
ground for granting a new trial.’” Id. at ___ (citation omitted). “Unless i t
can be said that directly contradictory testimony was so far impeache d
that it was deprived of all probative value or that the jury could no t
believe it, or contradicted indisputable physical facts or defied physical
realities, the trial court must defer to the jury’s determination.” Id. at ___
(cleaned up). “The trial court may also override the jury’s credibilit y
determination when the testimony is patently incredible or it is s o
inherently implausible that it could not be believed by a reasonable juror,
or where the [witness’s] testimony has been seriously impeached and th e
case marked by uncertainties and discrepancies.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Thus, to obtain a new trial, the defendan t
must establish that one of these circumstances exists, and that there is a
real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted or that i t
would be a manifest injustice to allow the guilty verdict to stand.” Id. a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).

A. Comment on Witness’s Credibility by Interrogator or
Interviewer
“A witness may not comment on or vouch for the credibility of
another witness.” People v Lowrey, 342 Mich App 99, 109 (2022).
“Furthermore, a witness may not opine about the defendant’s guil t
or innocent in a criminal case.” Id. at 109 (cleaned up).
“Nevertheless, a police officer may testify about his or her
perceptions during the course of an investigation of whether a
defendant was being truthful.” Id. at 109. In Lowrey, a detective
“unambiguously expressed the opinion that defendant was lying t o
him” and “cloaked his opinion in a veneer of artificial credibility by
citing certain interviewing techniques[.]” Id. at 111. Although the
detective “never stated that he believed defendant actually
committed the crime” and “did not directly comment on the
defendant’s testimony at trial,” his testimony “was clearly relevant”
because the defendant’s “incriminating concessions during the
interview had a significant tendency to make facts at issue more
probable.” Id. at 111, 112. Further, “it was important for the jury t o
understand the nature of [his] interviewing techniques, including
why [he] had asked certain questions and to give context t o
defendant’s answers.” Id. at 111.
It is “permissible for an interviewing officer to recount what he or
she told an interviewee, including a statement of disbelief.”Lowrey,
342 Mich App at 113. “However, there is a subtle yet importan t
distinction between testifying that ‘I told him I did not believe hi m
as part of an interviewing technique,’ versus testifying that ‘I believe
he was lying on the basis of my experience and training’” — the
“latter clearly violates the prohibition against experts commenting
on the truthfulness of a defendant’s confession.” Id. at 113. The
Lowrey Court found that the detective’s “testimony clearly strayed
beyond the bounds of permissibility” when “the prosecutor stressed
how [the detective’s] conclusions were all based on an ostensibly
scientific method” “after attempting to have [the detective]
admitted as an expert[.]” Id. at 113. While “a witness’s opinion of
another witness’s credibility has no probative value,” “such a n
opinion is not necessarily unfairly prejudicial.” Id. at 115. Despite it s
concerns, the Lowrey Court did not “conclude that [the detective’s]
testimony was improper in its entirety or that the errors in hi s
testimony were outcome-determinative.” Id. at 113. The Court held
that “defendant’s own admissions, along with the other evidence
admitted at trial, [was] sufficient to establish that the errors in [the
detective’s] testimony were not, in this particular case, outcome-
determinative.” Id. at 115.
There is no “bright-line rule for the automatic exclusion of”
statements made by an interrogator or interviewer “that commen t

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.7
on another person’s credibility[.]” People v Musser, 494 Mich 337, 353
(2013). Rather, where such evidence is offered “for the purpose of
providing context to a defendant’s statements, the [evidence is] only
admissible to the extent that the proponent of the evidence
establishes that the interrogator’s statements are relevant to their
proffered purpose.” Id. at 353-354. See also MRE 401. “Accordingly ,
an interrogator’s out-of-court statements must be redacted if tha t
can be done without harming the probative value of a defendant’ s
statements.” Musser, 494 Mich at 356. In addition, even if the
evidence is deemed relevant, it may still be excluded under MRE
403, “and, upon request, must be restricted to their proper scope
under MRE 105.” Musser, 494 Mich at 354. In Musser, 494 Mich a t
359-362, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting tw o
interrogators’ statements to the jury because the statements were
irrelevant and not probative to providing context to the defendant’ s
statements. Many of the statements “could have been easily
redacted without harming the probative value of defendant’ s
statement.” Id. at 361. See also People v Tomasik, 498 Mich 953, 953
(2015) (holding that the trial court erred in “admitting the recording
of the defendants interrogation” because “nothing of any relevance
was said during the interrogation, . . . and thus [it] was no t
admissible evidence”).
B. Comment on Witness’s Credibility by CPS Worker
The trial court abused its discretion by allowing a witness t o
comment on or vouch for the credibility of another witness;
specifically, the court allowed a CPS worker to testify that “based o n
her investigation, she found that [the victim’s] allegations had bee n
substantiated,” and “there was no indication that [the victim] wa s
coached or being untruthful.” People v Douglas, 496 Mich 557, 570,
583 (2014) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). For the same
reason, the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed a n
expert forensic interviewer to testify that the victim “had not bee n
coached” and was “being truthful[.]” Id. at 570.
The Court of Appeals “has since distinguished between the
impermissible testimony in Douglas and testimony from a police
officer that ‘there was no indication that the victim had bee n
coached.’” People v Butsinas, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025), quotin g
People v Sardy, 313 Mich App 679, 723 (2015), vacated in part on
43
other grounds 500 Mich 887 (2016). In Sardy, there was no plai n
error affecting substantial rights where an officer testified as a n
expert “that there [was] no indication that [the] child victim wa s

Section 3.7 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
coached” on redirect examination after defense counsel pursued a
line of questioning suggesting that the victim had been coached o n
44
cross-examination. Sardy, 313 Mich App at 723. The Sardy Cour t
explained:
“We initially note that it is unclear from Douglas
whether the Court found problematic the testimon y
regarding coaching or whether the main or sole concer n
was the testimony about the victim’s truthfulness (o r
perhaps a combination thereof). Defendant makes n o
claim here that the officer ever opined at trial that th e
victim was telling the truth. In our view, giving a n
opinion that there was no indication that a child CSC
victim was coached based on forensic-intervie w
training, experience, education, and the totality of th e
circumstances, MRE 702 and MRE 703, is not the
equivalent of opining that the victim was credible o r
telling the truth. Indeed, we believe that there is also a
distinction between testifying that a child victim ha d
not been coached, like the definitive conclusion mad e
by the forensic interviewer in Douglas, 496 Mich at 570,
583, and testifying that there is no indication that a child
victim was coached, as opined by the officer in this case.
Additionally, defendant opened the door to the questio n
whether there was any indication of coaching.” Sardy,
313 Mich App at 722-723.
The Court further held that even if Douglas requires the conclusion
that the officer’s testimony was inadmissible, the defendant failed t o
demonstrate plain error affecting substantial rights; accordingly,
reversal was unwarranted. Sardy, 313 Mich App at 723.
In Butsinas, the Court of Appeals rejected defendant’s claim that a
social worker and a pediatric nurse practitioner “vouched for [the
victim] by opining that she was not coached.” Butsinas, ___ Mic h
App at ___ (although these witnesses did not testify as experts, they
“were medical professionals and it [was] possible that the jury could
consider them to be more objective sources than other lay witnesse s
given their training and relatively limited interaction with the
parties”). The social worker “testified about her assessment of [the
victim] for psychiatric care.” Id. at ___. “She testified that during he r
examination of [the victim], she did not see anyone tell [the victim]
44Defense counsel initially objected to the officer’s testimony on the basis that the officer was not an
expert; however, after the prosecution laid a foundation for purposes of allowing the officer to respond t o
the question about whether there was any indication of coaching, the officer was permitted to testif y
without further objection. Sardy, 313 Mich App at 721. Accordingly, the defendant’s argument on appea l
that the testimony was inadmissible because it vouched for the victim’s credibility was unpreserved, an d
therefore, reviewed for plain error affecting substantial rights. Id. at 721-722.
Page 3-56 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.7
what to say or how to answer her questions.” Id. at ___. “This is a fa r
cry from the testimony in Douglas that no coaching occurred.” Id. a t
___. “Testifying that she did not personally see anyone coach [the
victim] during her assessment is distinct from generally opining
that no one coached [the victim].” Id. at ___. Defendant als o
complained that the social worker’s “testimony relaying [the
victim’s] statements and describing the actions she took after
assessing [the victim], which included explaining that she changed
[the victim’s] medical team from ‘green’ to ‘red,’ because [the
victim], who was experiencing suicidal ideation, required ‘more
care’ and a ‘more sophisticated social work team.’” Id. at ___. “As a
mandatory reporter, [the social worker] also reported [the victim’s]
case to CPS.” Id. at ___. Notably, the social worker “did not at an y
point in her testimony opine that [the victim] was credible.” Id. a t
___ (“General testimony about the steps she took after
psychologically assessing [the victim] says nothing about th e
veracity of [the victim’s] allegations.”).
Similarly, the nurse practitioner “testified that when she examine d
[the victim] at the hospital, she did not observe either [the victim’ s
older sister] or [defendant’s girlfriend] attempting to influence [th e
victim’s] answers.” Id. at ___ (observing that the nurse practitioner
“only expressed that she personally did not witness anyone
coaching” the victim). “Again, this testimony is distinguishable
from Douglas.” Id. at ___. “Moreover, [the nurse practitioner]
expressly testified that she ‘can’t say one way or another’ whether
[the victim] was sexually abused when asked by defendant durin g
cross-examination.” Id. at ___. Further, the nurse practitioner did
not vouch for the victim’s credibility when she “called [the victim] a
‘credible narrator’ in response to a question of who [the nurse
practitioner] considered to be the best source of gathering [the
victim’s] medical history.” Id. at ___. Instead, she “explained that a t
[the victim’s] age she was able to relay information about herself to a
medical provider as opposed to relying on a parent to provide thi s
information.” Id. at ___ (noting that the nurse practitioner “did no t
testify that [the victim] was a victim of sexual assault or that she wa s
being truthful”). “Ultimately, defendant failed to show that [the]
witnesses used their specialized training and experience t o
improperly comment on [the victim’s] credibility.” Id. at ___ (“The
jury was not given an objective source to ‘hang its hat’ on whe n
determining the ultimate issue of whether sexual abuse occurred i n
this case.”).
C. Witness Comment on a Child’s Assertion of Sexual Abuse
“Generally, a witness may not comment or provide an opinion o n
the credibility of another witness, because credibility matters are t o
be determined by the jury.” People v Sattler-VanWagoner, ___ Mic h
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-57
Section 3.7 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Th e
same is true for expert witnesses.” Id. at ___. However, “when a
defendant attacks the credibility of the victim, a qualified exper t
may offer testimony to explain the typical behavior of victims of
child sex abuse.” Id. at ___. “In child sex abuse cases, an expert may
also testify regarding the typical symptoms of child sexual abuse i n
order to explain a victim’s specific behavior that might be
incorrectly construed by the jury as inconsistent with that of a n
abuse victim or to rebut a credibility attack.” Id. at ___. “Still, a n
expert may not vouch for the credibility of the victim.” Id. at ___.
“Commenting on the numerical odds or a statistical assessment of a
witness telling the truth or lying about sexual assault allegation s
amounts to vouching.” Id. at ___.
“[E]xpert witnesses may not testify that children overwhelmingly
do not lie when reporting sexual abuse because such testimony
improperly vouches for the complainant’s veracity.” People v Thorpe,
504 Mich 230, 235 (2019). Additionally, “examining physician s
cannot testify that a complainant has been sexually assaulted or ha s
been diagnosed with sexual abuse without physical evidence tha t
corroborates the complainant’s account of sexual assault or abuse
because such testimony vouches for the complainant’s veracity and
improperly interferes with the role of the jury.” Id. See also People v
Del Cid (On Remand), 331 Mich App 532, 542 (2020) (holding that “a n
examining physician’s testimony diagnosing a child-complainan t
with ‘possible sexual abuse’ is inadmissible without corroborating
physical evidence”; the admission of such evidence constitutes a
plain error requiring reversal).
In Sattler-VanWagoner, an expert witness impermissibly vouched for
the victim’s “credibility by testifying that false reports were
‘statistically very rare in cases like this’ for two reasons.” Sattler-
VanWagoner, ___ Mich App at ___. “First, although [the expert] did
not provide a specific percentage value, her comment on the
statistical rarity of a false report was sufficiently similar to bring her
testimony within the scope of Thorpe’s prohibitions.” Id. at ___
(reasoning there was no “meaningful difference between saying that
the likelihood a complainant will lie is 2% to 4% and saying that it i s
‘statistically very rare’”). “Second, the addition of the phrase ‘i n
cases like this’ comes dangerously close to commenting directly o n
[the victim’s] truthfulness or veracity in this case.” Id. at ___ (“Tha t
phrase directly linked the statistical likelihood of a false report t o
the testimony in this case.”).
“An expert is not permitted to testify that the particular child
victim’s behavior is consistent with that of a sexually abused child
because such information comes too close to testifying that the
particular child is a victim of sexual abuse.” People v Muniz, 34 3
Page 3-58 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.7
Mich App 437, 446 (2022) (quotation marks and citation omitted). I n
Muniz, the Court of Appeals concluded that an expert witness did
not improperly vouch for the complainant’s credibility because he
“never compared his general information about the behavior of
abuse victims with specific behavior of the complainant.” Id. at 446.
The Muniz Court observed that “general information about abuse
victim’s conduct” which “happened to be consistent with the
complainant’s postincident behavior does not constitute vouching.”
Id. at 447. The Court noted that the expert “testified that he had no t
met the complainant or read the police report or forensic interview,”
“made no references to the victim’s allegations, her disclosure of
information, or any other aspects of this case,” “and at n o
time . . . offer[ed] any opinion or statement that could be reasonabl y
understood as vouching for the complainant[.]” Id. at 447. Th e
Muniz Court further held that the examining physician did no t
improperly vouch for the complainant’s testimony where she “gave
no testimony respecting whether the complainant had been sexually
abused,” “did not provide any diagnosis,” including whether “the
complainant [was] a probable or actual victim of pediatric sexual
abuse,” “gave no opinion regarding the complainant’s statements,
and testified that she directed follow-up care for testing for sexually
transmitted disease infection from contact with bodily fluids.” Id. a t
450, 451.
“[T]estimony by a police officer witness improperly vouched for the
[child] complainant’s credibility and improperly commented on the
defendant’s guilt” where the detective “testified that th e
complainant’s demeanor during her interview was consistent wit h
that of a typical child sexual assault victim and that, given hi s
specialized training, the complainant’s testimony ‘seemed authenti c
to [him].’” People v Hawkins, 507 Mich 949 (2021) (third alteration i n
original). The detective also improperly testified “that he tried bu t
was unable to find inconsistencies in the complainant’s allegations,
stating, ‘[I]f I can’t prove that [the abuse] didn’t happen, then there’ s
a good possibility that it did,’ seemingly shifting the burden of
proof to defendant to prove his innocence,” and “also testified that,
on the basis of his investigation, he found defendant’s suggestio n
that the complainant made up the abuse allegations to get her
father’s attention to be ‘[n]ot true.’” Id. (alterations in original). The
Hawkins Court concluded “that, but for [a] deficiency in defense
counsel’s performance [to object to the testimony], there [was] a
reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have bee n
different” if the detective’s testimony had been excluded. Id.
See Section 4.3(B) for further discussion and information on victim s
of child sexual abuse.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-59
Section 3.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
D. Use of Religious Beliefs/Opinions to Impair or Enhance
Witness’s Credibility
“While evidence of religious matters may be relevant in certai n
narrow contexts, . . . if testimony about religious beliefs or opinion s
is offered to impair or enhance credibility, then that testimony mus t
be excluded.” Nahshal v Fremont Ins Co, 324 Mich App 696, 709
(2018). See also MCL 600.1436 and MRE 610. The Court declined t o
impose a rule of automatic reversal as set forth in People v Hall, 39 1
Mich 175 (1974) and its progeny, which have extended a limited rule
of automatic reversal to certain criminal cases in which a witnes s
gives testimony regarding the defendant’s or the victim’s religiou s
beliefs or opinions. Nahshal, 324 Mich at 722. Rather, the Nahshal
Court concluded that Hall and its progeny are limited to th e
criminal context and instead applied Sibley v Morse, 146 Mich 46 3
(1906), which concluded that in civil actions, prejudice must be
shown before reversal of a jury verdict is warranted. Nahshal, 32 4
Mich at 715-717 (no prejudice was found in Nahshal because the
Court concluded that the record demonstrated it was more probable
than not that the admission of the improper testimony was no t
outcome determinative).
Committee Tip:
This would be a useful time to ask the proponent
of religious beliefs/opinion testimony to
articulate the purpose of admission of the
evidence in question.
3.8 Examination & Cross-Examination
Only one attorney for a party is permitted to examine a witness, unles s
otherwise ordered by the court. MCR 2.507(C).
A. Control by Court
“The court must exercise reasonable control over the mode and
order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:
(1) make those procedures effective for determining th e
truth;
(2) avoid wasting time; and
Page 3-60 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.8
(3) protect witnesses from harassment or undu e
embarrassment.” MRE 611(a).
“The court must exercise reasonable control over the appearance of
parties and witnesses so as to:
(1) ensure that the fact-finder can see and assess thei r
demeanor; and
(2) ensure their accurate identification.” MRE 611(b).
B. Direct Examination
1. Presentation Order
Generally, in a civil case, the plaintiff must introduce it s
testimony first, unless otherwise ordered by the court. MCR
2.507(B). However, a defendant must present his or her
evidence first if:
“(1) the defendant’s answer has admitted facts and
allegations of the plaintiff’s complaint to the exten t
that, in the absence of further statement on the
defendant’s behalf, judgment should be entered o n
the pleadings for the plaintiff, and
(2) the defendant has asserted a defense on whic h
the defendant has the burden of proof, either as a
counterclaim or as an affirmative defense.” MCR
2.507(B).
Note that this rule may apply to criminal proceeding s
provided that it meets the criteria in MCR 6.006(D).
Committee Tip:
While unlikely to be employed in a criminal case,
the court might receive the testimony of expert
witnesses as in a prearranged order in civil cases,
and especially in domestic cases.
2. Leading Questions
Leading questions are only permissible on direct examinatio n
“as necessary to develop a witness’s testimony.” MRE
611(d)(1).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-61
Section 3.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Civil case. “[R]eversal may be predicated on the use of leading
questions only where prejudice or a pattern of elicitin g
inadmissible testimony exists.” In re Susser Estate, 254 Mic h
App 232, 239-240 (2002) (finding reversal was not require d
when the plaintiff asked leading questions of an elderly and
infirm witness only to the extent necessary to develop he r
testimony) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Criminal case. “[A] prosecutor has considerable leeway to ask
leading questions to child witnesses.” People v Johnson, 31 5
Mich App 163, 199-200 (2016). “In order to demonstrate tha t
reversal is warranted for the prosecution asking leadin g
questions, it is necessary to show some prejudice or patterns o f
eliciting inadmissible testimony.” Id. at 200 (holding that th e
prosecutor’s use of leading questions was necessary to develo p
the victim’s testimony where the victim was six years old at th e
time of trial and was clearly “distraught” and frequently aske d
for clarification or did not understand the questions )
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
C. Cross-Examination
“A witness may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to any
issue in the case, including credibility.” MRE 611(c). “A party is fre e
to contradict the answers that he has elicited from his adversary or
his adversary's witness on cross-examination regarding matter s
germane to the issue. As a general rule, however, a witness may no t
be contradicted regarding collateral, irrelevant, or immaterial
matters.” People v Vasher, 449 Mich 494, 504 (1995). Impeachmen t
may be proper when the collateral matter “closely bear[s] o n
defendant’s guilt or innocence[.]” Id.
1. Limiting Cross-Examination
Cross-examination may be limited under certai n
circumstances, MRE 611, such as to protect witnesses from
harassment or undue embarrassment. MRE 611(a). Specifically,
“MRE 611(a) allows the trial court to prohibit a defendant fro m
personally cross-examining vulnerable witnesses—
particularly children who have accused the defendant o f
committing sexual assault. The court must balance the criminal
defendant’s right to self-representation with the State’ s
important interest in protecting child sexual abuse victim s
from further trauma.” People v Daniels, 311 Mich App 257, 269-
271 (2015) (holding that the “trial court wisely and properl y
prevented defendant from personally cross-examining [hi s
children regarding their testimony that he sexually abused
them,] to stop the children from suffering harassment and
Page 3-62 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.8
undue embarrassment,” following “a motion hearing at whic h
[the court] heard considerable evidence that defendant’ s
personal cross-examination would cause [the children ]
significant trauma and emotional stress”) (quotation mark s
and citations omitted). The defendant’s right to self-
representation was not violated under these circumstance s
where the defendant was instructed “to formulate question s
for his [children], which his advisory attorney then used t o
cross-examine them.” Id. at 269-270.
The trial court may also limit cross-examination regardin g
matters not testified to on direct examination. MRE 611(c). The
trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the plaintiff’ s
cross-examination of the defendant’s expert witness abou t
issues that were “marginally relevant to the case as a whole bu t
which [were] beyond the scope of the witness’ testimony o n
direct examination.” Beadle v Allis, 165 Mich App 516, 522-52 3
(1987).
2. Leading Questions
Generally, a court should allow leading questions on cross-
examination. MRE 611(d)(1)(A).However, the court is no t
always required to allow them. Shuler v Mich Physicians Mu t
Liability Co, 260 Mich App 492, 517-518 (2004).
MRE 611(d)(1)(B) permits leading questions “when a part y
calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified
with an adverse party.” The adverse party statute (MCL
600.2161) allows a party to “call[] the opposite party, or hi s
agent or employee, as a witness with the same privileges o f
cross-examination and contradiction as if the opposite part y
had called that witness.” Linsell v Applied Handling, Inc, 266
Mich App 1, 26 (2005). Neither MRE 611 nor MCL 600.2161 i s
violated if the court, in exercising its discretion under MRE
611(a), requires the cross-examination of the adverse party
during the adverse party’s case-in-chief. Linsell, 266 Mich App
at 26.
D. Redirect Examination
The scope of redirect examination is left to the discretion of the trial
court. Gallaway v Chrysler Corp, 105 Mich App 1, 8 (1981). “I n
general, redirect examination must focus on matters raised during
cross-examination.” Id. However, “this general rule does not equat e
to an entitlement to elicit any and all testimony on such topics.
Detroit v Detroit Plaza Ltd Partnership, 273 Mich App 260, 291 (2006) .
Indeed, MRE 104(a) requires the court to decide any question abou t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-63
Section 3.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
whether evidence is admissible, “regardless of whether th e
questioning at issue is properly within the scope of examination.”
Detroit, 273 Mich App at 291.
E. Recross-Examination
Generally, recross-examination is governed by the same principle s
as cross-examination. See People v Jackson, 108 Mich App 346, 348-
349 (1981).
On recross-examination, the parties may inquire into new matter s
not covered during cross-examination where the new matters are i n
response to matters introduced during redirect examination. People
v Goddard, 135 Mich App 128, 138 (1984), rev’d on other grounds 42 9
45
Mich 505 (1988).
F. Nonresponsive Answer
“[A]n unresponsive, volunteered answer to a proper question is no t
grounds for the granting a mistrial.” People v Haywood, 209 Mich
App 217, 228-229 (1995) (holding that “improper comments by the
victim’s father were not grounds for a mistrial” where the “witnes s
was not in a position to know that his testimony was improper,”
“the prejudicial effect of the witness’ statement was lessened
because he did not refer to defendant as the cause of the victim’ s
injury,” and “because [the comments] were not elicited by the
prosecutor’s questioning”). “A motion for mistrial should b e
granted only for an irregularity that is prejudicial to the rights of the
defendant and impairs the defendant’s ability to get a fair trial.”
People v Beesley, 337 Mich App 50, 54 (2021) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “The proper analysis for a motion for mistrial
depends principally, if not exclusively, on whether a defendant ha s
been prejudiced by an irregularity or error.” Id. at 55.
“While . . . police witnesses (and all witnesses) have an obligatio n
not to venture into forbidden areas of testimony, the key point is i n
regards to testimony which is ‘forbidden.’ An area of testimony i s
only ‘forbidden’ if the court rules it inadmissible. While many
things, including a defendant’s criminal history, are generally
inadmissible, there are exceptions for all such rules.” Id. at 57-58
(citation omitted) (suggesting “that it would be a good practice for a
trial court ruling on the admissibility of testimony to instruct the
prosecutor to inform the officer regarding what has been ruled
inadmissible prior to an officer’s testimony,” and that it is error t o
create “a blanket assumption that a police officer will in all instance s

note.
Page 3-64 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.8
know precisely what has been ruled admissible and what has bee n
ruled ‘forbidden’).
Committee Tip:
Seldom will a lone, stray answer compel a
mistrial.
G. Correction of Witness Testimony
The prosecution has a duty to correct false testimony of witnesses.
People v Smith, 498 Mich 466, 470 (2015). This duty applie s
“especially when that testimony conveys to the jury an asserted
confession from the defendant.” People v Brown, 506 Mich 440, 446
(2020). “When credibility is a dominant consideration i n
ascertaining guilt or innocence, other independent evidence apar t
from the testimony of the defendant and the victim is particularly
vital to the fact-finding process. And false testimony simply
undermines the jury’s ability to discern the truth in these
circumstances.” Id. at 453. Notwithstanding, “[i]n some cases, a ne w
trial will not be warranted given the sheer strength of the truthful
evidence relative to the false testimony.” Id.
In Brown, the detective, who interviewed defendant regarding th e
victim’s allegations of sexual assault, “asked defendant if the trut h
was ‘somewhere in the middle’” of the victim’s allegations and hi s
claim of innocence, to which the defendant gave no verbal o r
nonverbal response. Brown, 506 Mich at 447. At trial, the detective
“testified that defendant said that the truth . . . was actuall y
‘somewhere in the middle.’” Id. “Therefore, the prosecutor elicite d
false testimony from the detective on direct examination.” Id.
During cross-examination, the detective “never admitted that he
was mistaken,” and “simply stated that it was ‘possible’ he wa s
wrong and agreed that his testimony ‘could be incorrect.’” Id. a t
448-449. “Instead of correcting the record and having [the detective ]
concede that defendant never made any such admission,” the
prosecutor stated he could rely on the previous testimony and the
police report. Id. at 449. However, the detective’s “testimony on
direct and cross-examination was contradictory, and the police
report was patently false. Thus, the redirect examination did
nothing to correct the record and, indeed, further suggested that the
prosecutor believed that [the detective] initially told the truth and
that defendant made the admission during the interview.” Id. at 449-
450. “[T]he prosecutor’s failure to correct the testimony and instead
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-65
Section 3.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
rely on that testimony in questioning is especially problemati c
because it reinforced the deception of the use of false testimony and
thereby contributed to the deprivation of due process.” Id. at 450
(quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). The
prosecutor’s actions “left it to the jury to decide if defendant made
self-incriminatory statements during the interview. Leaving thi s
kind of false testimony for the jury to assess on its own is highly
prejudicial,” and likely “affected the jury’s verdict, one ultimately
resting on the credibility of the victim and the defendant.” Id. at 454
(vacating defendant’s conviction and remanding for a new trial).
In Smith, “the prosecution breached a duty to correct th e
substantially misleading, if not false, testimony of a key witnes s
about his formal and compensated cooperation in the government’ s
investigation,” where, “[g]iven the overall weakness of the evidence
against the defendant and the significance of the witness’ s
testimony, . . . there [was] a reasonable probability that th e
prosecution’s exploitation of the substantially misleading testimony
affected the verdict.” Smith, 498 Mich at 470. “Due process required
that the jury be accurately apprised of the incentives underlying the
testimony of this critical witness,” and “[c]apitalizing on [the
witness]’s testimony that he had no paid involvement in the
defendant’s case [was] inconsistent with a prosecutor’s duty t o
correct false testimony”; because “there [was] a ‘reasonable
likelihood’ that the false impression resulting from the prosecutor’ s
exploitation of the testimony affected the judgment of the
jury, . . . the defendant [was] entitled to a new trial.” Id. at 480, 483,
487.
H. Judicial Impartiality and Questioning
A trial court is vested with broad discretion over the administratio n
of trial proceedings. People v Taylor, 252 Mich App 519, 522 (2002).
See also MCL 768.29; MRE 611(a). “The court may examine a
witness regardless of who calls the witness.” MRE 614(b). “A part y
may object to the court’s calling or examining a witness either at tha t
time or at the next opportunity when the jury is not present.”
MRE 614(c).
“There are ‘three situations in which a trial court has good reason t o
interject itself into the trial: (1) when the trial is lengthy and
complex, (2) when attorneys are unprepared or obstreperous, or if
the facts become confused and neither side is able to resolve the
confusion, and (3) when a witness is difficult or not credible and the
attorney fails to adequately probe the witness, or if a witnes s
becomes confused.’” People v Plomb, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025),
quoting People v Davis, 216 Mich App 47, 49-50 (1996) (outlining th e
Page 3-66 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.8
limited situations in which a trial court may interject itself into the
trial).
Impartiality. “A trial judge's conduct deprives a party of a fair trial if
the conduct pierces the veil of judicial impartiality.” People v Stevens,
498 Mich 162, 164 (2015). “A judge’s conduct pierces this veil and
violates the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial when, considering
the totality of the circumstances, it is reasonably likely that the
judge’s conduct improperly influenced the jury by creating the
appearance of advocacy or partiality against a party.” Id. at 164.
“This inquiry requires a fact-specific analysis.” Id. at 171. “A singl e
inappropriate act does not necessarily give the appearance of
advocacy or partiality, but a single instance of misconduct may be s o
egregious that it pierces the veil of impartiality.” Id.
Courts should consider the following non-exhaustive list of factor s
“in deciding whether a judge’s conduct violates a defendant’s righ t
to a fair trial: (1) nature of the judicial intervention; (2) tone and
demeanor; (3) scope of the conduct in light of the trial’s complexity;
(4) direction of intervention; and (5) curative instructions.” Plomb,
___ Mich App at ___. “The fairness of trial and the process that i s
constitutionally due to a defendant are implicated when the jury i s
present and when they are excused.” Id. at ___ (applying “the multi-
factor inquiry on judicial impropriety to behavior that occurred
outside the presence of the jury at a jury trial”). In making thi s
determination, there is no presumption in favor of the trial cour t
[46]
being unbiased. Id. at ___ (noting that “neither Stevens nor Swilley
did so”). But see People v Biddles, 316 Mich App 148, 152 (2016) (“ A
defendant must overcome a heavy presumption of judicial
impartiality when claiming judicial bias.”).
Nature of judicial conduct. “Identifying the nature of the conduc t
provides the starting point to evaluate whether the conduc t
overstepped the line of judicial impartiality.” Stevens, 498 Mich a t
173. “For instance, when evaluating a judge’s questioning of
witnesses, a reviewing court must first bear in mind that such
interrogation is generally appropriate under MRE 614(b).” Id.
“Therefore, it is appropriate for a judge to question witnesses t o
produce fuller and more exact testimony or elicit additional relevan t
information.” Id. (noting “the central object of judicial questionin g
should be to clarify”). “Judicial questioning, nevertheless, has
boundaries.” Id. at 174.
“It is inappropriate for a judge to exhibit disbelief of a witness,
intentionally or unintentionally.” Id. at 174. “It is essential that th e
judge not permit his own views on disputed issues of fact to become
46People v Swilley, 504 Mich 350 (2019).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-67
Section 3.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
apparent to the jury.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted)
(holding that the trial court’s “repeated questioning of defendant’ s
expert” invaded the prosecutor’s role and “projected incredulity,
bias, and hostility”) (id. at 180, 186). See also Swilley, 504 Mich at 35 6
(holding that the trial judge’s extensive questioning of the defense
alibi witnesses “improperly influenced the jury by creating a n
appearance of advocacy or partiality against the defendant”).
“It is difficult to distinguish the impact on a trial where a judge
directly questions one party’s witness versus where a judge direct s
strategy for one of the parties in a way that results in the
questioning of a key witness.” Plomb, ___ Mich App at ___. In Plomb,
“this strategic advising happened in a manner that wa s
nonresponsive to the prosecutor’s own objection and out-of-step
with the prosecution’s clear strategy with respect to prior bad act s
(which was to not use them).” Id. at ___. “[W]hile the judge did no t
actually resort to questioning the [confidential informant] before the
jury, the judge laid out the specific questions for cross-examinatio n
and told the parties that these questions would be asked in front of
the jury.” Id. at ___ (“Notably, at one point the judge did say h e
would do the questioning himself.”) (Id. at ___ n 2). “Just a s
credibility is squarely the responsibility of the jury, strategy i s
squarely the responsibility of the attorneys.” Id. at ___ (weighing
factor “in favor of concluding the judge pierced the veil of judicial
impartiality”).
Tone and demeanor. “To ensure an appearance of impartiality, a
judge should not only be mindful of the substance of his or her
words, but also the manner in which they are said.” Stevens, 498
Mich at 175. “Hostile questions from a judge are particularly
inappropriate when the witnesses themselves have done nothing t o
deserve such heated inquiry.” Id. “A judge must proceed wit h
particular care when engaging with a criminal defendant.” Id.
“Judicial questioning might be more necessary when a judge i s
confronted with a difficult witness who refuses to answer question s
posed by attorneys or repeatedly responds to those questions wit h
unclear answers, although the manner of judicial involvemen t
remains at the center of the examination by a reviewing court.” Id. a t
175-176.
“It will often be the case that analysis under this factor will dovetail
with analysis of the nature and type of judicial conduct; the manner
in which the judge’s inquiry is made will affect how the jury
perceives the conduct.” Id. at 186. “To the extent that it i s
appropriate, these factors may be considered together.” Id.
Length and complexity of trial. “In a long trial, or one with several
complicated issues posed to the jury, for instance, it may be mor e
Page 3-68 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.8
appropriate for a judge to intervene a greater number of times tha n
in a shorter or more straightforward trial.” Id. at 176. “Likewise,
given the principle that a judge’s questions may serve to clarif y
points that are obscure or confusing, a judge’s inquiries may b e
more appropriate when a witness testifies about a topic that i s
convoluted, technical, scientific, or otherwise difficult for a jury t o
understand.” Id. (citation omitted).
Questions directed at one side more than the other. “Judicia l
partiality may be exhibited when an imbalance occurs with respec t
to either the frequency of the intervention or the manner of th e
conduct.” Id. at 177. See People v Cole, 349 Mich 175, 188-189 (1957)
(finding judicial intervention unacceptable when the record
contained 16 pages of both extensive and heated cross-examinatio n
by the trial judge of the defendant’s witnesses, but no similar
examination of the prosecution’s witnesses); see also People v Young,
364 Mich 554, 558 (1961).
Curative instructions. “The presence or absence of a curative
instruction is a factor in determining whether a court displayed the
appearance of advocacy or partiality.” Plomb, ___ Mich App at ___
(cleaned up). “The model jury instructions—both for civil and
criminal trials—emphasize that a judge’s . . . questions do no t
constitute evidence and that the jury should not attempt to discer n
the judge’s personal opinion while considering the case.” Stevens,
498 Mich at 177. “Additionally, during the course of a proceeding, a
trial judge has the ability to issue a curative instruction immediatel y
in response to conduct that could give rise to the appearance of
bias.” Id. “Because it is well established that jurors are presumed t o
follow their instructions, a curative instruction will often ensure a
fair trial despite minor or brief inappropriate conduct.” Id. (cleaned
up). “Depending on the circumstances, an immediate curative
instruction may further alleviate any appearance of advocacy o r
partiality by the judge.” Id. “That said, in some instances judicial
conduct may so overstep its bounds that no instruction can erase th e
appearance of partiality.” Id. at 177-178.
For more information on judicial bias and impartiality, see the
Michigan Judicial Institute’s Judicial Disqualification in Michigan. See
the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Civil Proceedings Benchbook, Chapter
7, and Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 12, for
additional information on judicial questioning during trial.

Section 3.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
3.9 Impeachment of Witness—Bias, Character, Prior
Convictions, Prior Statements
A. Ways to Impeach a Witness
Subject to any conditions described in the applicable rules of
evidence, there are four classic ways to impeach a witness:
47
• Interest or bias, see MRE 611(c);
48
• Character for truthfulness or untruthfulness —
MRE 608(a) (reputation or opinion evidence), an d
MRE 608(b) (evidence of specific instances o f
conduct);
49
• Evidence of a criminal conviction, MRE 609; and
50
• Prior statements, MRE 613, MRE 801(d)(1), and
MRE 806.
A statement contained in a published treatise, periodical, or
pamphlet is only admissible to impeach an expert witness on cross-
examination if “the publication is on a subject of history, medicine,
or other science or art” and “is established as a reliable authority by
the testimony or admission of the witness, by other exper t
testimony, or by judicial notice.” MRE 707. A statement from a
qualified publication “may be read into evidence but must not be
received as an exhibit.” Id.
Committee Tip:
MRE 707 is a rule of allowance and limitation a s
to the format of the evidence.
47 See Section 3.9(C).
48 See Section 3.9(D).
49 See Section 3.9(E). Note that impeachment by contradiction is governed by MRE 404(b) as other acts
evidence where the prosecution attempts to admit the defendant’s prior conviction to impeach by
contradiction a witness’ testimony. People v Wilder, 502 Mich 57, 63-64 (2018). See Section 2.4 for more
information on admission of other-acts evidence.
50 See Section 3.9(F) and Section 3.9(G).
Page 3-70 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.9
B. Collateral Matters
“It is a well-settled rule that a witness may not be impeached by
contradiction on matters which are purely collateral. What is a
collateral matter depends upon the issue in the case. . . . Th e
purpose of the [collateral matters] doctrine is closely related to the
goals of the prejudice rule, MRE 403, and generally the same factor s
which are employed to determine whether evidence is inadmissible
under 403 are used to determine whether extrinsic evidence should
be allowed for impeachment purposes.” Cook v Rontal, 109 Mich
App 220, 229 (1981) (citations omitted).
“[T]here are three kinds of facts that are not considered to be
collateral. The first consists of facts directly relevant to the
substantive issues in the case. The second consists of facts showing
bias, interest, conviction of crime and want of capacity or
opportunity for knowledge. The third consists of any part of the
witness’s account of the background and circumstances of a material
transaction which as a matter of human experience he would no t
have been mistaken about if his story were true.” People v Guy, 121
Mich App 592, 604-605 (1982).
C. Witness Bias
Generally, the court has broad discretion to allow questioning
designed to show bias, prejudice, or interest on the part of a witness.
Detroit/Wayne Co Stadium Auth v Drinkwater, Taylor & Merrill, Inc, 26 7
Mich App 625, 653 (2005). The Michigan Supreme Court explained
witness bias as follows:
“‘Bias is a term used in the ‘common law of evidence’ t o
describe the relationship between a party and a witnes s
which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously o r
otherwise, his testimony in favor of or against a party.
Bias may be induced by a witness’ like, dislike, or fear o f
a party, or by the witness’ self-interest. Proof of bias i s
almost always relevant because the jury, as finder of fac t
and weigher of credibility, has historically been entitle d
to assess all evidence which might bear on the accurac y
and truth of a witness’ testimony.’” People v Layher, 464
Mich 756, 763 (2001), quoting United States v Abel, 469
US 45, 52 (1984).
There is no specific rule of evidence that covers this form of
impeachment, but MRE 401 (relevancy) and MRE 611 (mode of
examining witnesses) seem applicable. Interest or bias is always
relevant to a witness’s credibility and MRE 611(c) states that “[a]
witness may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to any issue
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-71
Section 3.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
in the case, including credibility.” Layher, 464 Mich at 764. “[I]t i s
always permissible upon cross-examination of an adverse witness t o
pursue facts that may bear on a witness’s bias.” Detroit/Wayne Co
Stadium Auth, 267 Mich App at 653.
Committee Tip:
While not contained in a particular rule, bias is
strong evidence. Indeed, it is noted in MRE 408
and MRE 411 as a reason to allow otherwise
inadmissible evidence to be properly used.
“[A] trial court may allow inquiry into prior arrests or charges for
the purpose of establishing witness bias where, in its sound
discretion, the trial court determines that the admission of evidence
is consistent with the safeguards of the Michigan Rules of
Evidence.” Layher, 464 Mich at 758. In Layher (a case involving
criminal sexual conduct), the defendant’s lead witness had bee n
previously arrested for and acquitted of criminal sexual conduc t
charges. Id. at 760. The Court concluded that evidence of th e
witness’s prior arrest was relevant because its admission “support s
the inference that [the witness] would color his testimony in favor of
defendant.” Id. at 765.
D. Character
“Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible
to prove that the person acted in accordance with the character o r
51
trait.” MRE 404(a)(1). However, MRE 404(a)(3) permits a witness’ s
credibility to be attacked or supported through reputatio n
testimony, opinion testimony, or inquiry into specific instances of
conduct, as permitted by MRE 608, which states:
“(a) Reputation or Opinion Evidence. A witness’s
credibility may be attacked or supported by testimon y
about the witness’s reputation for having a character fo r
truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by testimony in th e
form of an opinion about that character. But evidence o f
truthful character is admissible only after the witness’s
character for truthfulness has been attacked.
(b) Specific Instances of Conduct. Except for a criminal
conviction under [MRE 609], extrinsic evidence is no t
51 See Section 2.3 on character evidence.
Page 3-72 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.9
admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s
conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s
character for truthfulness. But the court may, on cross-
examination, allow them to be inquired into if they ar e
probative of the character for truthfulness o r
untruthfulness of:
(1) the witness; or
(2) another witness whose character the witnes s
being cross-examined has testified about.”
1. MRE 608(a) Examples
It is error for a court to allow character testimony that goe s
“beyond [the witness’s] reputation for truthfulness and
encompasse[s] [the witness’s] overall ‘integrity.’” Ykimoff v W A
Foote Mem Hosp, 285 Mich App 80, 102 (2009) (finding,
however, that the error was harmless).
Where a party attacks a witness’s credibility, but not th e
witness’s character for truthfulness, the opposing party ma y
not present evidence to bolster the witness’s truthful character.
People v Lukity, 460 Mich 484, 490-491 (1999). In Lukity, th e
defense counsel asserted during his opening statement that th e
complainant had emotional problems which affected he r
ability to describe the alleged sexual assaults. Id. at 490. Befor e
the complainant testified, the trial court allowed th e
prosecution to present testimony from several other witnesse s
as to the complainant’s truthful character. Id. at 488-489. Th e
Michigan Supreme Court concluded that the defendant’ s
opening statement did not implicate MRE 608(a), and the trial
court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of th e
complainant’s truthful character where her truthful characte r
had never been attacked. Lukity, 460 Mich at 491.
2. MRE 608(b) Examples
Where a witness was not called as a character witness and di d
not testify on direct examination about the plaintiff’ s
truthfulness or untruthfulness, the defendant was no t
permitted to cross-examine the witness about specifi c
instances of the plaintiff’s conduct for the purpose o f
impeaching the plaintiff. Guerrero v Smith, 280 Mich App 647,
655 (2008). In Guerrero, the plaintiff testified about his limited
marijuana use, and thereafter, defense counsel cross-examined
one of the plaintiff’s witnesses in an effort to impeach the
plaintiff’s testimony regarding his marijuana use. Id. at 654 .
The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the witness’ s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-73
Section 3.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
testimony should not have been admitted because it did no t
satisfy the technical requirements of MRE 608(b)(2). Guerrero,
280 Mich App at 654. The Court stated:
“Before specific instances concerning another
witness’s character for truthfulness or
untruthfulness may be inquired into on cross-
examination, the witness subject to cross-
examination must already have testified on direct
examination regarding the other witness’ s
character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. ”
Guerrero, 280 Mich App at 654-655.
E. Prior Criminal Conviction
Under MRE 609, a witness’s character for truthfulness may b e
attacked on cross-examination by evidence of a criminal convictio n
only if it has been elicited from the witness or established by publi c
record and the following conditions are met:
“(1) the crime contained an element of dishonesty o r
false statement; or
(2) the crime contained an element of theft; and
(A) in the convicting jurisdiction, the crime wa s
punishable by imprisonment for more than one
year or by death; and
(B) the court determines that the evidence ha s
significant probative value on character for
truthfulness and — if the witness is the defendan t
in a criminal trial — that the probative valu e
outweighs any prejudicial effect.” MRE 609(a).
See also MCL 600.2158.
1. Use
Crimes involving elements of dishonesty or false statement.
Evidence of a witness’s prior criminal conviction i s
automatically admissible if it contains an element o f
dishonesty or false statement. People v Allen, 429 Mich 558, 60 5
(1988). See also People v Snyder (After Remand), 301 Mich Ap p
99, 105 (2013).
Crimes involving elements of theft. Evidence of a witness’ s
prior conviction of a crime containing an element of theft “may
be admissible if certain conditions are met.” Snyder (After
Page 3-74 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.9
Remand), 301 Mich App at 105. See also MRE 609(a)(2). “Whic h
conditions need be met are in part a function of whether th e
witness is the defendant.” Snyder (After Remand), 301 Mich Ap p
at 105. “As a first step, regardless of whether the witness is th e
defendant, the court is required to determine that the proffere d
prior theft crime conviction has ‘significant probative value o n
the issue of credibility[.]’” Snyder (After Remand), 301 Mich Ap p
at 105, quoting MRE 609(a)(2)(B).
Determining probative value and prejudicial effect. If th e
witness is the defendant in a criminal trial, the court must als o
decide whether “the probative value outweighs any prejudicial
effect.” MRE 609(a)(2)(B). “In determining probative value, th e
court must consider only the age of the conviction and th e
degree to which it indicates character for truthfulness.” MRE
609(b). “[I]n general, theft crimes are minimally probative o n
the issue of credibility, or, at most, are moderately probative o f
veracity.” Snyder (After Remand), 301 Mich App at 106 (cleaned
up) (holding that a two-year-old prior conviction did not hav e
52
significant probative value of credibility ).
“Regarding the age of the conviction, as a general matter, th e
older a conviction, the less probative it is.” Snyder (After
Remand), 301 Mich App at 106. Evidence of a conviction is no t
admissible under MRE 609 “if more than ten years have passed
since the date of the conviction or of the witness’s release fro m
the confinement for it, whichever is later.” MRE 609(c).
When considering prejudicial effect, “the court must consider
only the conviction’s similarity to the charged offense and the
possible effects on the decisional process if admitting th e
evidence causes the defendant to elect not to testify.” MRE
609(b). As the similarity of charges and the importance of th e
defendant’s testimony to the decisional process increases, s o
does the prejudicial effect. Allen, 429 Mich at 606.
“The court must articulate, on the record, the analysis of eac h
factor.” MRE 609(b).
“[I]t is error to cross-examine a defendant about the duratio n
and details of prior prison sentences to test his credibility. ”
People v Lindberg, 162 Mich App 226, 234 (1987). The rational e
52 Typically, where the defendant is the witness, courts must also determine whether the probative value
of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. See MRE 609(A)(2)(b). However, if “a prior conviction is not
significantly probative of credibility, the prejudicial-effect inquiry is unnecessary because the prio r
conviction has already failed to meet one of the rule’s requirements.” Snyder (After Remand), 301 Mic h
App at 109-110 (concluding that the prejudicial effect inquiry was unnecessary because “evidence of
defendant’s prior larceny conviction [was] not of significant probative value on the issue of his credibility”).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-75
Section 3.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
for this rule is that only a defendant’s prior conduct is relevan t
to his credibility, not the punishment for the conduct. Id.
“[T]here can be no error until a defendant testifies and th e
prior-conviction impeachment evidence is actuall y
introduced[.]” People v McDonald, 303 Mich App 424, 431, 43 9
(2013) (“[b]y choosing not to testify defendant waived hi s
argument that the trial court erred when it ruled that a prio r
conviction would be admissible for impeachment purpose s
should he take the stand and testify”). However, when a
defendant waives the opportunity to testify due to defens e
counsel’s incorrect advice that a prior conviction could be use d
as impeachment evidence, such conduct could constitut e
ineffective assistance of counsel. See People v Perkins, 141 Mic h
App 186, 191 (1985).
Evidence of a defendant’s prior criminal conviction can b e
introduced in a subsequent civil case based on the sam e
conduct as long as it does not violate MRE 403. Waknin v
Chamberlain, 467 Mich 329, 333-335 (2002). “Where a civil cas e
arises from the same incident that resulted in a crimina l
conviction, the admission of evidence of the criminal
conviction during the civil case is prejudicial for precisely th e
same reason it is probative. That fact does not, without more,
render admission of evidence of a criminal conviction unfair,
i.e., substantially more prejudicial than probative.” Id. at 33 6
(finding the trial court improperly excluded evidence of a prio r
conviction as being prejudicial without also weighing whethe r
the prejudice was unfair).
Committee Tip
The heavy lifting here is classifying the prior
conviction as either one containing an element
of dishonesty or false statement, or instead, an
element of theft. The latter requires additional
consideration for admission under MR E
609(a)(2).
2. Notice of Intent to Impeach Defendant
The burden is not on the prosecutor in all cases to initiate a
ruling regarding the use of a defendant’s prior conviction s
before the defendant testifies. People v Nelson, 234 Mich Ap p
454, 463 (1999). However, a request for a prior ruling is th e
Page 3-76 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.9
prudent course, especially if admitting the prior conviction i s
discretionary. See MRE 609(b).
3. Jury Instructions
Civil. M Civ JI 5.03, Impeachment by Prior Conviction of
Crime.
Criminal. M Crim JI 3.4, Defendant—Impeachment by Prio r
Conviction.
4. Standard of Review
The decision whether to allow impeachment by evidence of a
prior conviction is within the trial court’s sound discretion and
will not be reversed absent abuse of that discretion. People v
Coleman, 210 Mich App 1, 6 (1995). However, “[t]he erroneou s
admission of evidence of a prior conviction is harmless erro r
where reasonable jurors would find the defendant guilt y
beyond a reasonable doubt even if evidence of the prio r
conviction had been suppressed.” Id. at 7.
F. Prior Statements
While examining a witness about their prior statement, the
examining party is not required to show or disclose the contents of
the witness’s prior statement, unless requested by an adverse party’ s
attorney or the witness. MRE 613(a).
For information regarding the use of depositions or interrogatorie s
at trial, see Section 3.12.
1. Prior Consistent Statements
“As a general rule, neither party in a criminal trial is permitted
to bolster a witness’ testimony by seeking the admission of a
prior consistent statement made by that witness.” People v
Lewis, 160 Mich App 20, 29 (1987). However, the statement i s
not considered hearsay and may be admissible where th e
statement “is consistent with the [witness’s] testimony and i s
offered to rebut an express or implied charge that the [witness ]
recently fabricated it or acted from a recent improper influenc e
or motive in so testifying[.]” MRE 801(d)(1)(B). “A prior
consistent statement is admissible to rehabilitate the witnes s
following impeachment by a prior inconsistent statemen t
or . . . when there is a question as to whether the prior
inconsistent statement was made.” Palmer v Hastings Mut Ins
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-77
Section 3.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Co, 119 Mich App 271, 273-274 (1982) (internal citation s
omitted).
Four elements must be established before admitting a prio r
consistent statement: “(1) the declarant must testify at trial an d
be subject to cross-examination; (2) there must be an express o r
implied charge of recent fabrication or improper influence o r
motive of the declarant’s testimony; (3) the proponent mus t
offer a prior consistent statement that is consistent with th e
declarant’s challenged in-court testimony; and, (4) the prio r
consistent statement must be made prior to the time that th e
supposed motive to falsify arose.” People v Jones, 240 Mich App
704, 707, 712 (2000) (the motive mentioned in elements (2) an d
(4) must be the same motive) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). Consistent statements made after the motive t o
fabricate arises constitute inadmissible hearsay. People v
McCray, 245 Mich App 631, 642 (2001).
Prior consistent statements may be admitted through a third-
party if the requirements of MRE 801(d)(1)(B) are met. See
Jones, 240 Mich App at 706-707; People v Mahone, 294 Mich App
208, 214 (2011) (the victim’s statement to her coworker, mad e
before the victim would have had a motive to falsify, wa s
properly admitted through the coworker’s testimony).
Committee Tip:
Challenges that the court must consider usually
arise under the third prong of Jones.
2. Prior Inconsistent Statements
“When a witness claims not to remember making a prio r
inconsistent statement, he may be impeached by extrinsi c
evidence of that statement. The purpose of extrinsi c
impeachment evidence is to prove that a witness made a prio r
inconsistent statement—not to prove the contents of th e
statement.” People v Jenkins, 450 Mich 249, 256 (1995). However,
where the substance of the prior inconsistent statement goes t o
a central issue in the case, admission of the statement i s
improper because it violates MRE 801 (hearsay rule). People v
Stanaway, 446 Mich 643, 692-693 (1994). “[P]rior unswor n
statements of a witness are mere hearsay and are generall y
inadmissible as substantive evidence.” People v Lundy, 467 Mich
254, 257 (2002). Accordingly, prior inconsistent statement s
Page 3-78 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.9
cannot be admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted
unless a recognized hearsay exception applies. People v
Steanhouse, 313 Mich App 1, 29 (2015), aff’d in part and rev’d in
53
part on other grounds 500 Mich 453 (2017). ”Extrinsi c
evidence of a witness’s prior inconsistent statement i s
admissible only if the witness is given an opportunity t o
explain or deny the statement and an adverse party is given a n
opportunity to examine the witness about it, or if justice s o
requires.” MRE 613(b). However, MRE 613(b) “does not apply
to an opposing party’s statement under [MRE 801(d)(2)].” MRE
613(b).
Generally, evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of th e
witness may be used to impeach a witness, even if it tends t o
directly inculpate the defendant. People v Kilbourn, 454 Mic h
677, 682 (1997). However, a prior inconsistent statement shoul d
not be admitted when “(1) the substance of the statemen t
purportedly used to impeach the credibility of the witness i s
relevant to the central issue of the case, and (2) there is no othe r
testimony from the witness for which his credibility wa s
relevant to the case.” Id. at 683 (noting that this analysis is ver y
narrow, and concluding that the facts did not support a findin g
of inadmissibility “because there was other relevant testimon y
from the witness for which his credibility was relevant”).
a. Foundation
When seeking to admit a prior inconsistent statement, a
proper foundation for the statement must be laid. Barnett
v Hidalgo, 478 Mich 151, 165 (2007). To introduc e
impeachment testimony, the witness to be impeached
must be asked whether he or she made the first statement,
then asked whether he or she made the later, inconsisten t
statement. Id. at 165.
Before using the victim’s statements from Child Protective
Services (CPS) reports “as extrinsic evidence of prior
inconsistent statements,” “defendant had to lay a proper
foundation in accordance with the rules of evidence[.]”
People v Butsinas, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “Th e
proponent of the evidence must elicit testimony
inconsistent with the prior statement, ask the witness t o
admit or deny making the first statement, then ask the
witness to admit or deny making the later, inconsisten t
statement, allow the witness to explain the inconsistency,
53For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-79
Section 3.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
and allow the opposite party to cross-examine the
witness.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). In Butsinas, defendan t
argued that the testimony of the authors of two CP S
reports “was vital to impeach” the victim but could no t
show their “testimony would be admissible at trial for
this purpose.” Id. at ___. “Because the purpose of extrinsi c
impeachment evidence [was] to prove that a witnes s
made a prior inconsistent statement, and not to prove the
contents of that statement, the contents of the report itself
[was] not be substantively admissible.” Id. at ___ (stating
that the victim “was the appropriate witness to questio n
regarding the prior inconsistent statements”).
b. Constitutional Considerations
Even where a defendant’s prior inconsistent statemen t
was elicited in violation of the Sixth Amendment,
admission of the statement is generally permitted when i t
is offered as impeachment testimony. Kansas v Ventris, 55 6
US 586, 594 (2009). In Ventris, 556 US at 588-589, the
defendant was charged with murder and aggravated
robbery, testifying at trial that his codefendant committed
the crimes. The prosecution attempted to presen t
testimony from an informant, planted in the defendant’ s
jail cell by police officers, that the defendant admitted t o
robbing and shooting the victim. Id at 589. The United
States Supreme Court disagreed with the Kansa s
Supreme Court’s conclusion that the informant’ s
testimony was inadmissible for any reason, including
impeachment, instead concluding:
“Once the defendant testifies in a way tha t
contradicts prior statements, denying th e
prosecution use of ‘the traditional truth-
testing devices of the adversary process,’ is a
high price to pay for vindication of the righ t
to counsel at the prior stage.
On the other side of the scale, preventin g
impeachment use of statements taken i n
[54]
violation of Massiah would add littl e
appreciable deterrence. Officers hav e
significant incentive to ensure that they an d
their informants comply with th e
Constitution’s demands, since statement s
54 Massiah v United States, 377 US 201, 206 (1964), guarantees a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel
during interrogation by law enforcement officers or their agents.
Page 3-80 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.9
lawfully obtained can be used for al l
purposes rather than simply fo r
impeachment. And the ex ante probability tha t
evidence gained in violation of Massiah woul d
be of use for impeachment is exceedingl y
small. An investigator would have t o
anticipate both that the defendant woul d
choose to testify at trial (an unusua l
occurrence to begin with) and that he would
testify inconsistently despite the admissibilit y
of his prior statement for impeachment. ”
Ventris, 556 US at 593, quoting Harris v Ne w
York, 401 US 222, 225 (1971) (citation omitted).
c. Examples
In medical malpractice cases, when an expert’s trial
testimony is not consistent with statements appearing i n
the expert’s affidavit of merit, the affidavit of meri t
constitutes a prior inconsistent statement and i s
admissible at trial for impeachment purposes. Barnett v
Hidalgo, 478 Mich 151, 164-167 (2007).
Where a witness’s “police statement implicating
defendant in [a crime] was admissible only to impeac h
[the witness’s] trial testimony, the prosecution’s use of the
statement as substantive evidence of defendant’s guilt,
and the trial court’s instruction[ that the jury could
consider prior inconsistent statements as substantive
evidence], constituted plain error.” People v Steanhouse,
313 Mich App 1, 29-30 (2015), aff’d in part and rev’d i n
55
part on other grounds 500 Mich 453 (2017) (nevertheless
concluding that “in light of the extensive evidence
admitted at trial linking defendant to the
[crime], . . . these errors did not prejudice defendant”).
The trial court erred in admitting a hearsay statement a s
impeachment testimony where “the content of th e
[hearsay] statement . . . was [not] needed to impeach [th e
declarant’s] testimony that he did not make such a
statement,” and “there was no other testimony from [the
witness] that made his credibility relevant to the case.”
People v Shaw, 315 Mich App 668, 685 (2016). The declaran t
was the complainant’s brother, whose testimony “had
little, if any, probative value,” and “[a] review of the
55For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-81
Section 3.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
[declarant’s] testimony leaves little doubt that the
prosecution’s purpose in calling him as a witness was t o
have him describe the incident later described by [the
officer who offered the impeachment testimony].” Id. a t
682-683. The complainant’s brother was asked on direc t
examination if he remembered telling the police about a
fight between his mother and the defendant. Id. at 682.
The complainant denied remembering the fight and
stated that he did not remember telling the police about it.
Id. The prosecution then called an officer as a n
impeachment witness who described the altercatio n
between the defendant and the complainant’s mother tha t
the complainant’s brother allegedly reported to the
officer. Id. at 683. The Court held that “the prosecutor
improperly used an elicited denial as a springboard for
introducing substantive evidence under the guise of
rebutting the denial,” and the impeachment testimony
should not have been admitted. Id. at 685 (quotation
marks and citation omitted). Further, the Court found
that the content of the statement offered as impeachmen t
evidence also violated MRE 404(b) and MRE 403. Shaw,
315 Mich App at 688.
d. Impeachment of Hearsay Declarants
“When a hearsay statement — or a statement described in
[MRE 801(d)(2)(C), MRE 801(d)(2)(D), or MRE
801(d)(2)(E)] — has been admitted in evidence, th e
declarant’s credibility may be attacked, and then
supported, by any evidence that would be admissible for
those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.”
MRE 806. Evidence of the declarant’s inconsisten t
statement or conduct may be admitted, “regardless o f
when it occurred or whether the declarant had a n
opportunity to explain or deny it.” Id. However, “[i]f th e
party against whom the statement was admitted calls the
declarant as a witness, the party may examine th e
declarant on the statement as if on cross-examination.” Id.
Evidence that may be admissible under MRE 806 “is still
subject to the balancing test under MRE 403[.]” People v
Blackston, 481 Mich 451, 461 (2008).
G. Evidence of Defendant’s Silence
“[T]he use for impeachment purposes of a defendant’s prior
statement, including omissions, given during contact with the
police, prior to arrest or accusation, does not violate the defendant’ s
Page 3-82 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.10
constitutional rights as guaranteed under the Fifth and Fourteent h
Amendments or the Michigan Constitution.” People v Cetlinski, 43 5
Mich 742, 746-747 (1990). However, if a defendant’s silence i s
attributable to invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege agains t
56
self-incrimination or to reliance on Miranda warnings, admissio n
of evidence of that silence is error. People v McReavy, 436 Mich 197,
201 (1990). “The evidentiary issue should be analyzed as a party
admission under MRE 801(d)(2)(A).” McReavy, 436 Mich at 201.
A prosecutor may not “seek to impeach a defendant’s exculpatory
story, told for the first time at trial, by cross-examining the
defendant about his failure to have told the story after receiving
Miranda warnings at the time of his arrest.” Doyle v Ohio, 426 US 610,
611 (1976). “[U]se of the defendant’s post-arrest silence in thi s
manner violates due process,” and is commonly referred to as a
“Doyle error.” Id.; McReavy, 436 Mich at 202 n 2. However, an
arrested defendant’s post-Miranda silence may be used against th e
defendant if he or she “testifies to an exculpatory version of event s
and claims to have told the police the same version upon arrest.”
Doyle, 426 US at 619 n 11. See also People v Boyd, 470 Mich 363, 37 4
(2004).
“[A] defendant’s post-arrest, post-Miranda silence cannot be used t o
impeach a defendant’s exculpatory testimony, or as direct evidence
of defendant’s guilt in the prosecutor’s case-in-chief[.]” People v
Shafier, 483 Mich 205, 213-214 (2009) (citation omitted). This i s
because “‘there is no way to know after the fact whether [the
defendant’s post-arrest, post-Miranda silence] was due to the
exercise of constitutional rights or to guilty knowledge.’” Id. at 214,
quoting McReavy, 436 Mich at 218. The “defendant’s rights under
Doyle were violated when the trial court erroneously allowed th e
prosecution to use defendant’s post-arrest, post-Miranda silence
against him.” People v Borgne, 483 Mich 178, 181 (2009) (but findin g
“that the error did not amount to plain error affecting defendant’ s
substantial rights”), aff’d 485 Mich 868 (2009). “[I]n some
circumstances a single reference to a defendant’s silence may no t
amount to a violation of Doyle if the reference is so minimal tha t
‘silence was not submitted to the jury as evidence from which it wa s
allowed to draw any permissible inference[.]’” Shafier, 483 Mich a t
214-215, quoting Greer v Miller, 483 US 756, 764-765 (1987).
3.10 Rule of Completeness
“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, a n
adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any othe r
56Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966). See Section 3.13 for discussion of self-incrimination.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-83
Section 3.10 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
part — or any other writing or recorded statement — that in fairnes s
ought to be considered at the same time.” MRE 106.
Committee Tip:
The policy behind the rule is two-fold: (a) to
avoid matters being taken out of context,
resulting in false or misleading impressions; and
(b) to provide the opposing attorney an
opportunity to cure any prejudice created by a
lack of context through later introduction of
missing evidence.
“MRE 106 has no bearing on the admissibility of the underlyin g
evidence; rather it allows the adverse party to supplement the record t o
provide a complete picture.” People v Clark, 330 Mich App 392, 421-423
(2019) (MRE 106 was not implicated where “the officers failed to record a
few moments of [a] second interrogation, . . . nothing prevented
defendant from eliciting testimony from the police officers to fill in th e
gaps created by the failure to record defendant’s entire interview,” and
there was no assertion “that the video at issue had been altered in an y
way”).
However, “MRE 106 does not automatically permit an adverse party t o
introduce into evidence the rest of a document once the other part y
mentions a portion of it. Rather, MRE 106 logically limits the
supplemental evidence to evidence that ‘ought in fairness to b e
considered contemporaneously with it.’” People v Herndon, 246 Mich Ap p
371, 411 n 85 (2001), quoting MRE 106.
“[T]he rule of completeness only pertains to the admissibility of writing s
or recorded statements[.]” People v Solloway, 316 Mich App 174, 201 (2016)
(holding that MRE 106 was irrelevant where the defendant argued tha t
the failure to admit the actual testimony of two witnesses whos e
testimony was excluded as hearsay violated the rule of completeness).
Committee Tip:
While not often coming up when MRE 106 is in
play, the admissibility of the rest and remainder
evidence may have to satisfy other rules of
evidence to be admissible.

3.11 Refreshing Recollection
A. Writing or Object Used to Refresh a Witness
MRE 612 permits the use of a writing or an object to refresh a
witness’s memory either while testifying or before testifying, “if
practicable and the court decides that justice requires the party t o
have those options at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the
witness is testifying.” MRE 612(a).
MRE 612(b) provides guidance on the production and use of a
writing or object:
“An adverse party is entitled to have the writing o r
object produced, to inspect it, to cross-examine th e
witness about it, and to introduce in evidence — for it s
bearing on credibility only unless otherwise admissibl e
under [the MREs] — any portion that relates to th e
witness’s testimony. If the producing party claims tha t
the writing or object includes unrelated matter, th e
court must examine it in camera, remove any unrelate d
portion, and order that the rest be delivered to th e
adverse party. Any portion removed over objectio n
57
must be preserved for the record.”
The court may issue any appropriate order if a writing or object i s
not produced or delivered as ordered. MRE 612(c). However, “if the
prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court mus t
strike the witness’s testimony or, — if justice so requires — declare a
mistrial.” Id.
B. Method of Refreshing Recollection of Witness
Before refreshing a witness’s recollection with a writing, “the
proponent must show that (1) the witness’s present memory i s
inadequate, (2) the writing could refresh the witness’s presen t
memory, and (3) reference to the writing actually does refresh the
witness’s present memory.” Genna v Jackson, 286 Mich App 413, 42 3
(2009).
In People v Favors, 121 Mich App 98, 107-108 (1982), during a
criminal sexual conduct trial, the juvenile complainant recalled only
part of her description of the defendant’s apartment, even after
reviewing her prior statement. The prosecutor further attempted t o
57Before declaring a mistrial, the court must give each defendant and the prosecutor an opportunity (on
the record) to comment on the propriety of the order, and to state whether that party consents, objects, o r
has alternative suggestions. MCR 6.417.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-85
Section 3.12 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
refresh her memory by reading the prior statement into evidence. Id.
at 108. The Court of Appeals held that this method of refreshing
recollection was improper, stating:
“Where the memory of a witness is to be refreshed, it i s
not necessary and is often highly prejudicial to permi t
the jury to hear the substance of the statement to b e
employed. Where memory or recollection is bein g
refreshed, the material used for that purpose is no t
substantive evidence. Rather, the material is employe d
to simply trigger the witness’s recollection of the events.
That recollection is substantive evidence and th e
material used to refresh is not. The substance of th e
statement used to refresh is admissible only at th e
instance of the adverse party.” Favors, 121 Mich App a t
109 (citation omitted).
Committee Tip:
It would be prudent to require the proponent t o
take away the refreshing document or object
after the witness acknowledges that his or he r
memory has been refreshed.
58
C. Introducing a Past Recorded Recollection
A writing may be used to refresh a witness’s memory under MRE
612, but if the memory is not refreshed and the writing qualifies as a
recorded recollection under MRE 803(5), it may be read int o
evidence or received as an exhibit if offered by an adverse party.
3.12 Depositions & Interrogatories
A. Use of Depositions at Trial
Ordinarily, depositions are considered hearsay. Shields v Reddo, 43 2
Mich 761, 766 (1989). However, there are exceptions such as MRE
803(18) (deposition testimony of an expert) and MRE 804(b)(2)
(deposition testimony when the declarant is unavailable).
58 Recorded recollection is a hearsay exception with its own foundational requirements. See Section
5.3(B)(5).
Page 3-86 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.13
Depositions are admissible subject to the rules of evidence. MCR
2.308(A).
The party seeking admission of a deposition bears the burden of
proving admissibility under the rules of evidence, and admission i s
at the discretion of the court. Lombardo v Lombardo, 202 Mich Ap p
151, 154 (1993). If it is used at trial, the deposition “shall not be filed
with the court, but must be submitted to the judge and made a n
exhibit under MCR 2.518 or MCR 3.930” (concerning receipt and
return or disposal of exhibits). MCR 2.302(H)(1)(b).
“Where it appears likely that the contents of a deposition will be
read to the jury, the court should encourage the parties to prepare
concise, written summaries of depositions for reading at trial in lie u
of the full deposition. Where a summary is prepared, the opposing
party shall have the opportunity to object to its contents. Copies of
the summaries should be provided to the jurors before they are
read.” MCR 2.513(F). See M Civ JI 4.11, which provides for
instructions to the jury when a summary of a deposition is read.
B. Use of Interrogatories at Trial
“The answer to an interrogatory may be used to the exten t
permitted by the rules of evidence.” MCR 2.309(D)(3).
The decision whether to admit interrogatories at trial is reviewed
for an abuse of discretion. DaFoe v Mich Brass & Electric Co, 175 Mic h
App 565, 568 (1989). “A trial judge does not abuse his discretion by
refusing to admit interrogatories at trial which have already bee n
answered by testimony, or which are irrelevant to the issues.” Id.
3.13 Self-Incrimination
“The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees a n
individual the right against self-incrimination.” People v Wade, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2025). “No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself[.]” US Const, Am V; see also Const
1963, art 1, § 17. The Fifth Amendment is applicable to the states throug h
the Fourteenth Amendment. Pennsylvania v Muniz, 496 US 582, 588 n 5
(1990). ”To protect this constitutional guarantee, police must administer
Miranda warnings before conducting a custodial interrogation.” Wade,
___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “For a n
interrogation to be ‘custodial,’ the suspect must be in ‘custody.’” Id. a t
___. For more information on custodial interrogations, see Sectio n
3.14(E).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-87
Section 3.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
A person’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applie s
in both criminal and civil proceedings. Phillips v Deihm, 213 Mich App
389, 399-400 (1995). “The privilege against self-incrimination not onl y
permits a person to refuse to testify against himself at a criminal trial i n
which he is a defendant, but also permits him not to answer official
questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal o r
informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal
proceedings.” Id.
The right against self-incrimination protects a person from incriminatin g
himself or herself for a crime already committed. People v Bassage, 27 4
Mich App 321, 325 (2007). Because a defendant commits a current crim e
when he or she decides to present false testimony (perjury), the Fift h
Amendment does not apply to the perjured testimony. Id. at 326. Th e
Court explained:
“The bedrock for this principle is, we hope, unsurprising:
providing false information is a course of action no t
authorized by the Fifth Amendment. Thus, although he wa s
never informed of his right against self-incrimination,
defendant, by providing false testimony, took a course of
action that the Fifth Amendment gave him no privilege t o
take. If the citizen answers the question, the answer must be
truthful. Accordingly, we hold that the prosecutor had n o
obligation to advise defendant of his Fifth Amendment righ t
against self-incrimination, because that right was no t
implicated by defendant’s decision to commit perjury.”
Bassage, 274 Mich App at 325-326 (quotation marks,
alteration, and citations omitted).
A. Trial Court Procedures
If the court determines that it is necessary to advise the witness of
his or her Fifth Amendment rights, the advice should be give n
outside the presence of the jury. People v Avant, 235 Mich App 499,
512-517 (1999). A trial court must follow an established procedure
when it discovers that a potential witness plans to invoke a
testimonial privilege. People v Paasche, 207 Mich App 698, 709
59
(1994).
B. Civil Cases
“[T]he Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences agains t
parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response t o
probative evidence offered against them: the amendment does no t
59See Section 1.9(B)(2) for a detailed discussion of this procedure.
Page 3-88 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.13
preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a
civil cause.” Phillips v Deihm, 213 Mich App 389, 400 (1995).
1. Individuals
“[A] defendant in a civil action may assert the privilege agains t
self-incrimination in the answer to the complaint when he o r
she believes that responding to particular paragraphs o r
allegations in the complaint calls for an incriminatin g
response.” Huntington Nat’l Bank v Ristich, 292 Mich App 376,
384 (2011). However, “[a] defendant must answer th e
allegations in the complaint that he or she can and make a
specific claim of privilege to the rest. A defendant’s prope r
invocation of the privilege in an answer will be treated as a
specific denial.” Id. at 387.
By invoking the Fifth Amendment, a person cannot be force d
to answer any question that would “furnish a link in the chai n
of evidence needed to prosecute[.]” PCS4LESS, LLC v Stockton,
291 Mich App 672, 677 (2011) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “To sustain the privilege, it need only be eviden t
from the implications of the question, in the setting in which i t
is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or a n
explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerou s
because injurious disclosure could result.” Id. at 677-678
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “A court should bar a
claim of privilege under the Fifth Amendment only when th e
answer cannot possibly be incriminating.” Id. at 678 (the trial
court’s order that defendants either produce a softwar e
program or submit affidavits denying possession of th e
program violated the Fifth Amendment privilege agains t
compelled self-incrimination because compliance with th e
order might have “furnish[ed] a link in the chain of evidenc e
needed to prosecute”).
2. Organizations
Organizations are not generally protected by the Fift h
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. PCS4LESS,
LLC v Stockton, 291 Mich App 672, 679 (2011). In addition, “the
custodian of an organization’s records may not refuse t o
produce the records even if those records might incriminat e
the custodian personally,” if the custodian holds the records i n
a representative capacity. Id. at 679-680. However, if th e
custodian holds the records in a personal capacity, the Fift h
Amendment privilege applies. Id. at 681. In PCS4LESS, LLC,
the Court of Appeals identified a three part test a court ma y
use to determine whether the privilege against self-
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-89
Section 3.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
incrimination may be used “to prevent the production of a n
organization’s documents:
1. Are the documents the records of the
organization rather than those of the individual
who has possession of them?
2. Does the custodian hold the records in a
representative, rather than a personal, capacity?
Assuming affirmative answers, in the case of a
corporation the inquiry is ended because of the
special nature of the corporate form and the state’ s
reservation of visitatorial powers over
corporations. In the case of non-corporate
organizations, however, a third question arises:
3. Does the organization have an established
institutional identity which is recognized as a n
entity apart from its individual members?”
PCS4LESS, LLC, 291 Mich App at 681 (holding tha t
the trial court’s order for a corporation to either
produce a software program or submit an affidavi t
denying possession of the program did not violate
the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled
self-incrimination because the privilege does no t
apply to organizations) (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
60
C. Criminal Cases
The privilege against self-incrimination is not waived by a
defendant’s guilty plea, and remains available at sentencing.
Mitchell v United States, 526 US 314, 325 (1999).
“‘Use’ immunity protects a witness only from the prosecutorial use
of compelled testimony. A witness granted ‘use’ immunity may still
be prosecuted for a crime in which he was involved and to whic h
his immunized testimony relates.” People v Jones, 236 Mich App 396,
399 n 1 (1999). That is, while a coerced confession is inadmissible i n
a criminal trial, it does not bar prosecution. Kastigar v United States,
406 US 441, 461 (1972).
60This subsection discuss a witness or suspect invoking the privilege against self-incrimination before (or
when no) Miranda warnings have been given. See Section 3.14 for information on a defendant invoking the
privilege after being informed of his or her Miranda rights.
Page 3-90 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.13
1. Invoking Privilege
The privilege against self-incrimination “is held by the witness.
However, the . . . constitutional privilege against self-
incrimination must not be asserted by a witness too soon, tha t
is, where there is no reasonable basis for a witness to fea r
incrimination from questions which are merely preliminary. ”
People v Dyer, 425 Mich 572, 578-579 (1986). “Thus, ‘a trial cour t
may compel a witness to answer a question only where th e
court can foresee, as a matter of law, that such testimony could
not incriminate the witness.’” People v Steanhouse, 313 Mich
App 1, 19-20 (2015), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on othe r
61
grounds 500 Mich 453 (2017), quoting Dyer, 425 Mich at 579.
A witness had a reasonable basis to fear incrimination fro m
questioning where the defendant’s statements to police, theor y
of the case, and testimony at trial indicated that the witnes s
“may have been intimately associated with the crimina l
transaction or involved in the commission of the crimes,” and
the prosecutor was “unable to predict whether charges would
be brought against [the witness] after he testified[.] ”
Steanhouse, 313 Mich App at 20.
When a testifying witness asserts his or her Fifth Amendmen t
privilege, prejudice may result to the defendant because th e
jury may illogically infer guilt. People v Poma, 96 Mich App 726,
731 (1980). For this reason, it is improper to call a witnes s
knowing he or she will assert the Fifth Amendment privilege.
People v Paasche, 207 Mich App 698, 708-709 (1994). The Poma
Court explained how to avoid prejudice and protect th e
defendant’s right to a fair trial:
“When the court is confronted with a potential
witness who is intimately connected with the
criminal episode at issue, protective measure s
must be taken. The court should first hold a
hearing outside the jury’s presence to determine if
the intimate witness has a legitimate
privilege[.] . . . This determination should b e
prefaced by an adequate explanation of the self-
incrimination privilege so the witness can make a
knowledgeable choice regarding assertion. . . . W e
do not believe that the burden of comprehending
the privilege should rest with witnesses; the
responsibility of informing must be the court’s.”
Poma, 96 Mich App at 732 (citations omitted).
61For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-91
Section 3.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
A criminal suspect generally must “expressly invoke th e
privilege against self-incrimination in response t o
[noncustodial police questioning] . . . in order to benefit from
it,” because “[a] suspect who stands mute has not done enoug h
to put police on notice that he is relying on his Fift h
62
Amendment privilege.” Salinas v Texas, 570 US 178, 181, 188
(2013) (plurality opinion). Accordingly, where “[the defendant ]
voluntarily answered the [noncustodial] questions of a polic e
officer who was investigating a murder[, b]ut . . . balked whe n
the officer asked whether a ballistics test would show that th e
shell casings found at the crime scene would match [th e
defendant’s] shotgun,” the prosecution’s argument at trial
“that [the defendant’s] reaction to the officer’s questio n
suggested that he was guilty” did not violate the Fift h
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, because th e
petitioner had failed to expressly invoke the privilege. Id. at
181.
2. Admissibility of Statements
Generally, a defendant’s statement is admissible as nonhearsa y
under MRE 801(d)(2), or under the statement against interes t
exception to the hearsay rule, MRE 804(b)(4), if the declarant i s
unavailable as defined in MRE 804(a). A defendant may be
unavailable to testify by exercising their constitutional right t o
remain silent.
MRE 410(a) precludes the admission of statements mad e
during plea discussions or in connection with a plea that wa s
63
withdrawn or vacated. However, a defendant’s voluntar y
testimony at a prior proceeding, including a guilty ple a
proceeding involving an unrelated crime, is generall y
admissible, “absent an indication that the prior testimony wa s
given under compulsion.” People v Plato, 114 Mich App 126,
134-135 (1981).
A statement can also be used for impeachment under MRE
613(b), the rule governing the use of a prior inconsisten t
62 “[T]wo exceptions [apply] to the requirement that witnesses invoke the privilege[ against self-
incrimination:] . . . First, . . . a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his
own trial, [and] . . . [s]econd, . . . a witness’ failure to invoke the privilege must be excused where
governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.” Salinas v Texas, 570 US 178, 184
(2013) (plurality opinion).
63 “[MRE 410(a)(4)] does not require that a statement made during plea discussions be made in the
presence of an attorney for the prosecuting authority.” People v Smart, 497 Mich 950, 950 (2015). Indeed,
MRE 410(a)(4) only requires that the defendant’s statement be made “during plea discussions” with th e
prosecuting attorney. See Section 2.10 for more information on MRE 410 and the admissibility of ple a
discussions.
Page 3-92 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.13
statement when the statement is offered to prove inconsistency,
and not to show the truth of the matter asserted. See People v
Jenkins, 450 Mich 249, 256 (1995) (witness’s claim that he di d
not remember making prior inconsistent statement wa s
sufficient foundation for the prosecution to introduce extrinsi c
evidence of prior statement to impeach witness, but not t o
prove the contents of the statement); People v Steanhouse, 313
Mich App 1, 29-30 (2015), aff’d in part and rev’d in part o n
64
other grounds 500 Mich 453 (2017) (holding that where a
witness’s “police statement implicating defendant in [a crime ]
was admissible only to impeach [the witness’s] testimony, th e
prosecution’s use of the statement as substantive evidence o f
defendant’s guilt, and the trial court’s instruction[ that the jur y
could consider prior inconsistent statements as substantiv e
evidence], constituted plain error,” but nevertheles s
concluding that “in light of the extensive evidence admitted a t
trial linking defendant to the [crime], . . . these errors did no t
prejudice defendant”).
3. Court-Ordered Psychological Evaluations
“[O]nce [a defendant] places into evidence his own expert’ s
psychological report (that used information obtained fro m
defendant), the Fifth Amendment (or its state counterpart )
cannot then be used as a shield to prevent the prosecution fro m
accessing similar information from defendant for their ow n
expert’s use[.]” People v Black, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024)
(Defendant “cannot have his cake and eat it too”) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). Thus, in a criminal trial, “‘where a
defense expert who has examined the defendant testifies tha t
the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit a
crime, the prosecution may offer evidence from a court-
ordered psychological examination for the limited purpose o f
rebutting the defendant’s evidence.’” Black, ___ Mich App at
___, quoting Kansas v Cheever, 571 US 87, 98 (2013).
The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination applies
to sentencing hearings. Black, ___ Mich App at ___.
Accordingly, a defendant has a Fifth Amendment right t o
remain silent at a presentence psychiatric examination. Id. a t
___. Therefore, “a criminal defendant, who neither initiates a
psychiatric evaluation nor attempts to introduce an y
psychiatric evidence, may not be compelled to respond to a
psychiatrist if his statements can be used against him at a
capital sentencing proceeding.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “If,
64For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-93
Section 3.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
however, a defendant requests such an evaluation or present s
psychiatric evidence, then, at the very least, the prosecution ma y
rebut this presentation with evidence from the reports of th e
examination that the defendant requested.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
65
In a Miller hearing, “when a defendant intends on submitting
an expert witness and report to the trial court that addresse s
any relevant Miller factors, neither the Fifth Amendment nor
art 1, § 17 of the Michigan Constitution are violated when th e
defendant is required by court order to submit to a n
examination by a state witness.” Black, ___ Mich App at ___.
“[B]ecause the prosecutor bears the burden of proof at a Miller
hearing, and that burden is to rebut a presumption that th e
particular juvenile defendant is not deserving of life withou t
parole, providing the prosecution the ability to have its exper t
meet with defendant for purposes of expert evaluation and
testimony to rebut defendant’s evidence does not violate hi s
right against self-incrimination.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
Indeed, “nothing in the amendment allows a defendant t o
submit evidence relevant to his current mental status while a t
the same time refusing the prosecution access to the sam e
information and opportunity[.]” Id. at ___.
“Thus, while recognizing that defendant retains his Fift h
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, it remains th e
case that the privilege cannot be selectively asserted in a n
effort to control what narrative or information is available to a
court and the prosecutor.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the Fift h
Amendment is not violated (or the right is waived) b y
requiring defendant to cooperate with a state expert hired t o
rebut the evidence defendant is submitting on the issue”) .
“Even as a general rule, in the context of testimony and cross-
examination, a witness, in a single proceeding, may not testif y
voluntarily about a subject and then invoke the privileg e
against self-incrimination when questioned about the details. ”
Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Allowing a
witness when testifying to pick and choose what aspects of a
particular subject to discuss would call into question th e
trustworthiness of the statements and limit the integrity of th e
factual inquiry.” Id. ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted) .
“Any resultant distortion by allowing an individual t o
completely control the narrative could make of the Fift h
Amendment not only a humane safeguard against judiciall y
coerced self-disclosure but a positive invitation to mutilate th e
65Miller v Alabama, 567 US 460 (2012).
Page 3-94 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.13
truth a party offers to tell.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
Committee Tip:
Confusion sometimes emerges when a prior out-
of-court inconsistent statement is attempted to
be used to show inconsistency and as
substantive evidence. The latter purpose is
allowed but only if there is a basis under the
rules to overcome hearsay or other objections.
D. Child Protective Proceedings
“[A] parent’s constitutional right against compelled self-
incrimination bars a court in child protective proceedings fro m
requiring that parent, as a condition of reunification, to admit t o
having abused an unrelated child.” In re Blakeman, 326 Mich App
318, 331 (2018). “The privilege may be invoked when criminal
proceedings have not been instituted or even planned.” Id. at 332. I n
Blakeman, compulsion existed even where “respondent initiall y
waived his Fifth Amendment right, testified at the trial, and wa s
then later compelled to retract his claim of innocence and
66
incriminate himself.” Id. at 335.
A “respondent-father was not compelled to provide a n
incriminating statement in violation of the Fifth Amendment” whe n
it terminated his parental rights to his minor child after he
repeatedly “denied abusing drugs despite his positive drug screens,
and the trial court noted his refusal to acknowledge his substance-
abuse problem in concluding he had not demonstrated adequate
progress in overcoming his addiction.” In re Simpson, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2024). In Simpson, the respondent-father asserted that “h e
should not have been required to admit to drug use in order to be
granted reunification . . . .” Id. at ___ (rejecting argument that “the
trial court violated his rights by giving him the choice betwee n
admitting to drug use, therefore exposing himself to criminal
liability, or denying drug use, which would result in termination of
his parental rights”). The Simpson Court distinguished In re
Blakeman, 326 Mich App 318 (2018), where “the respondent was
given the extreme and detrimental Hobbesian choice betwee n
66See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Child Protective Proceedings Benchbook, Chapter 11, for additional
discussion of self-incrimination in child protective proceedings.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-95
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
admitting to a criminal act of child abuse or continuing to be
separated from his children and eventually losing his parental
rights.” Simpson, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up). According t o
the Court, the respondent-father in Simpson “was not comparably
compelled to incriminate himself.” Id. at ___. Instead, in Simpson,
the issue “was whether respondent-father was able to overcome hi s
substance-abuse issues in order to be reunified with [his minor
child], and the trial court’s overriding concern was not wit h
respondent-father admitting to drug use but with him addressing
the substance-abuse problem that the evidence overwhelmingly
showed.” Id. at ___ (noting that “the trial court’s decision t o
terminate respondent-father’s parental rights focused on the fac t
that he was unable to demonstrate improvement with overcoming
addiction, a barrier to reunification”).
3.14 Confessions
A. Corpus Delicti Rule
“[G]enerally speaking, the corpus delicti of an offense is the body of
the wrong or injury.” People v Modelski, 164 Mich App 337, 341
(1987). “The corpus delicti rule is designed to prevent the use of a
defendant’s confession to convict him of a crime that did not occur.”
People v Washington, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “Specifically, the rule provides that a defendant’ s
confession may not be admitted unless there is direct or
circumstantial evidence independent of the confession establishing
(1) the occurrence of the specific injury (for example, death in case s
of homicide) and (2) some criminal agency as the source of the
injury.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).“However,
proof of the identity of the perpetrator of the act or crime is not a
part of the corpus delicti.” Id. at ___(cleaned up). “It is sufficient t o
show that the crime was committed by someone.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Once this showing has been made, a defendant’s confession the n
may be used to elevate the crime to one of a higher degree or t o
establish aggravating circumstances.” People v Ish, 252 Mich App
115, 117 (2002) (cleaned up). Accordingly, “it is not necessary tha t
the prosecution present independent evidence of every element of
the offense before a defendant’s confession may be admitted.” Ish,
252 Mich App at 117.
“The corpus delicti rule requires that a preponderance of direct or
circumstantial evidence, independent of a defendant’s inculpatory
statements, establish the occurrence of a specific injury and criminal
agency as the source of the injury before such statements may be
Page 3-96 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
admitted as evidence.” People v Burns, 250 Mich App 436, 438 (2002).
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is unnecessary. Modelski, 164 Mic h
App at 341-342 (“the prosecutor established the corpus delicti of a
homicide by showing that [the victim] could not be located and
ha[d] not been heard from since her sudden disappearance and by
showing that defendant had a motive to kill her, his deteriorating
marriage and his claim of infidelity, and by showing tha t
defendant’s actions suggest[ed] that he had murdered [the victim]”).
Notably, “the corpus delicti rule is confined to confessions. ”
Washington, ___ Mich at ___ (cleaned up), quoting People v Porter,
269 Mich 284, 289 (1934) (expressly distinguishing confessions fro m
admissions). A confession is “an acknowledgment, in express terms,
by a party in a criminal case, of the truth of the crime charged, by
the very force of the definition logically excludes: first, acts of guilty
conduct; second, exculpatory statements; third, admission of
subordinate facts that do not constitute guilt . . . .” Washington, __ _
Mich at ___ n 13, quoting Porter, 269 Mich at 290 (quotation mark s
omitted). “There must be some distinctive feature, showing guilt, i n
the fact acknowledged, and all other statements than those directly
stating the fact of guilt are without the scope of the rule affecting the
use of confessions.” Washington, ___ Mich at ___ n 13, quoting Porter,
269 Mich at 290-291 (quotation marks omitted). “Hence, the thir d
ground of exclusion is that the admission of subordinate facts, no t
directly involving guilt, do not constitute a confession.” Washington, ___
Mich at ___ n 13, quoting Porter, 269 Mich at 290-291 (quotation
marks omitted).
The Porter Court held that “‘defendant’s exclamation and statement s
were not part of a confession nor did they, of themselves, amount t o
a confession of guilt. They were merely admissions, which needed other
facts to give them convicting force, and therefore were admissible on the
corpus delicti.’” Washington, ___ Mich at ___, quoting Porter, 269
Mich at 291. Similarly, in Washington, “Defendant’s statemen t
included only one of the two elements of the charged crime: the fac t
that defendant possessed body armor.” Washington, ___ Mich at __ _
(“An admission of one, but not of all, the essential elements of the
crime is not a confession.”) (cleaned up). “He did not admit that he
was a violent felon, which would have been necessary to make hi s
statements a confession.” Id. at ___ (holding that the corpus delict i
rule did “not apply to defendant’s admissions that he possessed the
bulletproof vest”).
When the corpus delicti of the underlying crime is established,
admission of a defendant’s confession to being an accessory after the
fact requires no independent evidence showing that the principal
was assisted after committing the crime; “the corpus delicti of
accessory after the fact is the same as the corpus delicti of th e
underlying crime itself.” People v King, 271 Mich App 235, 23 7
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-97
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(2006). See also People v Williams, 422 Mich 381, 388-392 (1985), for a
discussion of the history and development of the corpus delicti rule.
Committee Tip:
Care should be taken not to conflate the
accused’s confession with other statements by
the accused.
The trial court’s decision regarding application of the corpus delicti
rule is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Burns, 250 Mich App a t
438.
B. Miranda Requirements
1. Required Warnings
Miranda warnings are required when a defendant is subject t o
custodial interrogation. See People v Elliott, 494 Mich 292 (2013).
For more information on custodial interrogations, see Sectio n
3.14(E).
“[A suspect] must be warned prior to any questioning [1] tha t
he has the right to remain silent, [2] that anything he says ca n
be used against him in a court of law, [3] that he has the right t o
the presence of an attorney, and [4] that if he cannot afford a n
attorney one will be appointed for him prior to an y
questioning if he so desires.” Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436,
479 (1966).
“Unless the person in custody has been given the required
warnings and still waives his rights, no evidence obtained as a
result of interrogation can be used against him. A person i n
custody may waive his rights if the waiver is made voluntarily,
67
knowingly, and intelligently.” People v Clark, 330 Mich Ap p
392, 416 (2019) (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Right to remain silent. Miranda warnings are not defectiv e
merely because a suspect is not more specifically advised the y
may exercise the right to remain silent at any point during th e
interrogation. People v Mathews, 324 Mich App 416, 429 (2018).
67See Section 3.14(D)(2) for information on voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waivers.
Page 3-98 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
Right to an attorney. “[A]dvice that a suspect has ‘the right t o
talk to a lawyer before answering any of [the law enforcemen t
officers’] questions,’ and that he can invoke this right ‘at an y
time . . . during th[e] interview,’ satisfies Miranda.” Florida v
Powell, 559 US 50, 53 (2010) (second and third alteration i n
original). Because “[t]he first statement communicated tha t
[the defendant] could consult with a lawyer before answerin g
any particular question, and the second statement confirmed
that [the defendant] could exercise that right while th e
interrogation was underway,” the United States Suprem e
Court held that “[i]n combination, the two warning s
reasonably conveyed [the defendant’s] right to have a n
attorney present, not only at the outset of interrogation, but a t
all times.” Id. at 62.
Contrast with Mathews, 324 Mich App at 438, which holds tha t
“a warning preceding a custodial interrogation is deficien t
when the warning contains only a broad reference to the ‘righ t
to an attorney’ that does not, when the warning is read in it s
entirety, reasonably convey the suspect’s right to consult wit h
an attorney and to have an attorney present during th e
interrogation.”
2. Major Felony Recordings
There is no due process requirement under either the United
States Constitution or the Michigan Constitution that a n
electronic recording be made when a defendant is informed o f
his or her Miranda rights, People v Geno, 261 Mich App 624, 627-
628 (2004), or that a defendant’s statement be recorded b y
audio or visual means, People v Fike, 228 Mich App 178, 183-18 6
(1998). However, “[a] law enforcement official interrogating an
individual in custodial detention regarding the individual’ s
involvement in the commission of a major felony shall make a
time-stamped, audiovisual recording of the entir e
interrogation. A major felony recording shall include the law
enforcement official’s notification to the individual of th e
individual’s Miranda rights.” MCL 763.8(2).
“[Q]uestioning a suspect in a police station, by itself, [cannot ]
provide a legal basis for a finding that a person is in custody.”
People v Barritt, 325 Mich App 556, 569 n 4 (2018) (finding,
however, that the defendant was in custody based on th e
68
Court’s review of the totality of the circumstances).
68 See Section 3.14(E) for additional discussion of the Barritt case.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-99
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“The requirement in [MCL 763.8] to produce a major felony
recording is a directive to departments and law enforcemen t
officials and not a right conferred on an individual who i s
interrogated.” MCL 763.10. In addition:
“Any failure to record a statement as required
under [MCL 763.8] or to preserve a recorded
statement does not prevent any law enforcemen t
official present during the taking of the statemen t
from testifying in court as to the circumstances and
content of the individual’s statement if the cour t
determines that the statement is otherwise
admissible. However, unless the individual
objected to having the interrogation recorded and
that objection was properly documented under
[MCL 763.8(3)], the jury shall be instructed that it i s
the law of this state to record statements of a n
individual in custodial detention who is under
interrogation for a major felony and that the jury
may consider the absence of a recording i n
evaluating the evidence relating to the individual’ s
statement.” MCL 763.9.
“With MCL 763.8, the Legislature codified its preference for
recorded statements. With MCL 763.9, the Legislature set fort h
the remedy for violating the prior section–a jury instruction.
The Legislature did not codify an exclusionary rule for the par t
of the interrogation that was recorded,” and the Court o f
Appeals refused to create one. People v Clark, 330 Mich Ap p
392, 424 (2019) (the trial court did not err “by not instructin g
sua sponte the jury in accordance with MCL 763.9,” where i t
was assumed that a missing minute or so of the defendant’ s
interrogation fell within MCL 763.8, because “the absen t
instruction did not affect defendant’s substantial rights”).
C. Invoking Miranda Rights
1. Invoking the Right to Silence
“If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior t o
or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, th e
interrogation must cease. Any statements that occur after tha t
point are deemed to be the product of compulsion.” People v
Clark, 330 Mich App 392, 416 (2019) (quotation marks an d
citations omitted).
The defendant must clearly invoke the Miranda rights. See
People v Williams, 275 Mich App 194, 197-200 (2007)
Page 3-100 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
(defendant’s refusal to write out the first statement he made t o
the police did not constitute an invocation of his right t o
silence).
2. Invoking the Right to Counsel
“The assertion of the right to counsel during a custodial
interrogation is a per se invocation of the right to remai n
silent.” People v Clark, 330 Mich App 392, 416 (2019).
Accordingly, “an accused, . . . [who has] expressed his desire t o
deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject t o
further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has bee n
made available to him, unless the accused himself initiate s
further communication, exchanges, or conversations with th e
69
police.” Edwards v Arizona, 451 US 477, 484-485 (1981). See
also Clark, 330 Mich App at 416. “[W]hen an accused ha s
invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial
[70]
interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be
established by showing only that he responded to furthe r
police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has bee n
advised of his rights.” Edwards, 451 US at 484.
The request for counsel must be unambiguous. Davis v Unite d
States, 512 US 452, 459 (1994). The suspect “must articulate hi s
desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a
reasonable police officer in the circumstances would
understand the statement to be a request for an attorney. If th e
statement fails to meet the requisite level of clarity, Edwards
does not require that the officers stop questioning the suspect. ”
Id.
“When a suspect unequivocally invokes [the] right to counsel,
the police must terminate their interrogation immediately and
may not resume questioning until such counsel arrives.” People
v Burnett, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “It is crucial that th e
invocation of this right be clear and unequivocal—‘if a suspec t
makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous o r
equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of th e
circumstances would have understood only that the suspec t
might be invoking the right to counsel, . . . cessation of
questioning [is not required].” Id. at ___, quoting Davis, 512 U S
at 459. “It is also crucial that the request reflect a present desire
for counsel, not a future need.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). “The test for whether a suspect clearly an d
69See Section 3.14(D)(7) for information on reinitiating contact by defendant.
70 See Section 3.14(D) for more information on valid waivers of Miranda rights.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-101
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
unequivocally invoked his or her right to counsel is objective. ”
Id. at ___.
In Burnett, defendant argued “that he requested an attorney
four times during the interview [with two Michigan Stat e
Police detectives], including when he stated, ‘It’s just I want m y
lawyer. I, I will be comfortable with my lawyer cause I jus t
don’t, you know I don’t know the system.’” Id. at ___. “All of
defendant’s alleged requests for counsel took place befor e
defendant was read his Miranda rights and before he made
incriminating statements.” Id. at ___ n 4. “Once defendan t
stated that he wanted an attorney, the detectives were require d
to cease their interrogation.” Id. at ___ (“conclud[ing] tha t
saying, ‘I want my lawyer’ is a clear, unequivocal, and presen t
demand for an attorney”). “While defendant added that h e
‘will be comfortable’ with a lawyer because he did not ‘kno w
the system,’ this comment was an explanation for why he wa s
presently demanding an attorney, and it in no way rendere d
defendant’s statement ‘I want my lawyer’ equivocal o r
ambiguous.” Id. at ___. Furthermore, “whether a defendan t
unequivocally invoked his right to counsel is an objectiv e
inquiry, so an officer’s subjective belief is neither determinativ e
nor particularly persuasive.” Id. at ___ (rejecting argument tha t
the detective’s “testimony that she did not believe defendant’ s
request for an attorney was unequivocal supports that th e
request was, in fact, equivocal”) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). Indeed, “objectively, a reasonable officer would
understand that a suspect’s saying ‘It’s just I want my lawyer ’
is a clear and unequivocal invocation of the suspect’s right t o
an attorney.” Id. at ___.
3. Violation of Right to Counsel
“The right to have counsel present during custodial
interrogation is ‘a corollary’ of [the] right against self-
incrimination.” People v Burnett, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025 )
(“The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution,
applied to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment,
states, ‘No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal cas e
to be a witness against himself.’”).
“[W]hen a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, ‘a valid
waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only tha t
he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogatio n
even if he has been advised of his rights.’” Burnett, quoting
Edwards v Arizona, 451 US 477, 484 (1981). In Burnett, defendan t
“unequivocally invoked his right to an attorney, and th e
detectives continued the interview.” Id. at ___ (“conclud[ing]
Page 3-102 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
that saying, ‘I want my lawyer’ is a clear, unequivocal, an d
present demand for an attorney”). “While defendant adde d
that he ‘will be comfortable’ with a lawyer because he did no t
‘know the system,’ this comment was an explanation for wh y
he was presently demanding an attorney, and it in no wa y
rendered defendant’s statement ‘I want my lawyer’ equivocal
or ambiguous.” Id. at ___. “Even though the detective s
subsequently provided Miranda rights, defendant’s waiver of
those rights was invalid.” Id. at ___. “Defendant did no t
independently re-initiate contact with the detectives after h e
invoked his right to counsel; rather, after he was permitted t o
speak with his mother, he was brought back into th e
interrogation room and the interview continued.” Id. at ___.
“This shows that defendant’s right to end questioning until h e
had an attorney present was not ‘scrupulously honored.’” Id. a t
___ (citation omitted). “Instead, it was completely ignored.” Id.
at ___. “The trial court therefore should have grante d
defendant’s motion to suppress.” Id. at ___.
Confessions obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendmen t
right to counsel are generally inadmissible. People v Gonyea, 421
Mich 462, 478 (1984).
Where “the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into a n
unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect ”
and the suspect has been taken into custody for interrogation,
any statement elicited by the police cannot be used against th e
defendant unless he or she was given an opportunity t o
consult with counsel and was advised of his or her right t o
remain silent, because such a situation constitutes a denial o f
the assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.
Escobedo v Illinois, 378 US 478, 490-491 (1964).
“[S]tatements taken in violation of a defendant’s right t o
counsel, if voluntary, may be [admissible] for impeachmen t
purposes although they could not have been used in th e
prosecutor’s case-in-chief.” People v Stacy, 193 Mich App 19, 24-
25 (1992) (quotation marks and citation omitted). To use a
confession deliberately elicited following arraignment in it s
case-in-chief, the prosecution must prove that police obtained
a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent relinquishment of th e
Sixth Amendment right to counsel before they interrogated th e
accused. Patterson v Illinois, 487 US 285, 292-293 (1988). See
Section 3.14(D) for more information on valid waiver o f
Miranda rights, including the right to counsel.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-103
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
71
4. Violation of Privilege Against Self-Incrimination
Confessions obtained in violation of a defendant’s Fift h
Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incriminatio n
are not admissible. Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436, 474-47 7
(1966); People v Hill, 429 Mich 382, 394-395 (1987).
The following subsections discuss Miranda issues in detail.
D. Waiver of Miranda Rights
1. Burden of Proof
When a defendant contends that his or her confession wa s
involuntary, the prosecution must make an affirmativ e
showing that Miranda warnings were given prior to the
custodial interrogation and that a waiver was properl y
obtained before the defendant’s statements may be admitted i n
the prosecution’s case-in-chief. Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436,
444 (1966); People v Arroyo, 138 Mich App 246, 249-250 (1984) .
In Miranda, 384 US at 444-445, the Court held that the
prosecution must present evidence that the defendan t
voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his or he r
privilege against self-incrimination and rights to consult wit h
counsel and to have counsel present during a custodia l
interrogation. If the defendant claims that he or she did no t
validly waive Miranda rights, the prosecution has the burden of
proving by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a
voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of those rights.
Colorado v Connelly, 479 US 157, 168 (1986); People v Daoud, 462
Mich 621, 634 (2000). The court must examine the totality of th e
circumstances surrounding the interrogation when evaluatin g
the validity of a purported waiver of Miranda rights. Fare v
Michael C, 442 US 707, 724-725 (1979).
See Section 3.14(F) for information on motions to suppress.
2. Voluntary, Knowing, and Intelligent Waiver –
Generally
A suspect may waive his or her Miranda rights. Moran v
Burbine, 475 US 412, 421 (1986). However, the defendant’ s
waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. People v
72
Howard, 226 Mich App 528, 538 (1997). There is a distinction
between determining whether a defendant’s waiver of his o r
71 See Section 3.13 for general information on the privilege against self-incrimination.
Page 3-104 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
her Miranda rights was voluntary and whether an otherwis e
voluntary waiver was knowing and intelligent. People v
Garwood, 205 Mich App 553, 555 (1994). A valid waiver o f
Miranda rights requires a showing that the waiver wa s
voluntarily made—the result of the defendant’s uncoerce d
choice—and that the waiver was knowing and intelligent–
made with complete awareness of the rights waived and th e
consequences of waiving those rights. Id. at 556. See als o
Moran, 475 US at 421.
“Whether a waiver was voluntary and whether an otherwis e
voluntary waiver was knowingly and intelligently tendere d
form separate prongs of a two-part test for a valid waiver o f
Miranda rights. Both inquiries must proceed throug h
examination of the totality of the circumstances surroundin g
the interrogation.” People v Abraham, 234 Mich App 640, 644-
645 (1999) (internal citations omitted). See also People v Tierney,
266 Mich App 687, 707 (2005) (“the analysis must be bifurcated,
i.e., considering (1) whether the waiver was voluntary, and (2 )
whether the waiver was knowing and intelligent”).
“[W]hen a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, ‘a valid
waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only tha t
he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogatio n
even if he has been advised of his rights.’” People v Burnett, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2025), quoting Edwards v Arizona, 451 U S
477, 484 (1981). In Burnett, defendant “unequivocally invoked
his right to an attorney, and the detectives continued th e
interview.” Id. at ___ (“conclud[ing] that saying, ‘I want m y
lawyer’ is a clear, unequivocal, and present demand for a n
attorney”). “While defendant added that he ‘will be
comfortable’ with a lawyer because he did not ‘know th e
system,’ this comment was an explanation for why he wa s
presently demanding an attorney, and it in no way rendered
defendant’s statement ‘I want my lawyer’ equivocal o r
ambiguous.” Id. at ___. “Even though the detective s
subsequently provided Miranda rights, defendant’s waiver of
those rights was invalid.” Id. at ___. “Defendant did no t
independently re-initiate contact with the detectives after h e
invoked his right to counsel; rather, after he was permitted t o
speak with his mother, he was brought back into th e
interrogation room and the interview continued.” Id. at ___.
“This shows that defendant’s right to end questioning until h e
72 “A law enforcement official interrogating an individual in custodial detention regarding the individual’s
involvement in the commission of a major felony shall make a time-stamped, audiovisual recording of the
entire interrogation. A major felony recording shall include the law enforcement official’s notification to
the individual of the individual’s Miranda rights.” MCL 763.8(2). See Section 3.14(B)(2) for discussion o f
major felony recordings.

Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
had an attorney present was not ‘scrupulously honored’.” Id. at
___ (citation omitted). “Instead, it was completely ignored.” Id.
at ___. “The trial court therefore should have grante d
defendant’s motion to suppress.” Id. at ___.
“[T]he failure of police to inform a suspect of an attorney’ s
efforts to contact him does not invalidate[, under the Self-
Incrimination Clause of the Michigan Constitution, Const 1963,
art 1, § 17,] an otherwise ‘voluntary, knowing, and intelligent ’
[73]
Miranda waiver.” People v Tanner, 496 Mich 199, 249 (2014).
Rather, “‘[o]nce it is determined that a suspect’s decision not t o
rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew h e
could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was awar e
of the State’s intention to use his statements to secure a
conviction, the analysis is complete and the [Miranda] waiver i s
valid as a matter of law.’” Tanner, 496 Mich at 211, 256, quotin g
Moran, 475 US at 422-423 (concluding “that the United State s
Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Self–Incriminatio n
Clause of the Fifth Amendment in Moran [that ‘[e]vent s
occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirel y
unknown to him . . . have no bearing on’ the validity of a
Miranda waiver] constitutes the proper interpretation of [Const
1963, art 1, § 17] as well”).
3. Factors For Determining a Voluntary Waiver
For a confession to be voluntary, the totality of the
circumstances must demonstrate that the confession was “the
product of a free and deliberate choice rather tha n
intimidation, coercion, or deception,” or that the defendant’s
will was “overborne and his capacity for self-determinatio n
critically impaired[.]” People v Ryan, 295 Mich App 388, 39 7
(2012) (quotation marks and citation omitted); People v
Cipriano, 431 Mich 315, 334 (1988) (question marks and citatio n
omitted). “When the voluntariness of a confession i s
challenged, the burden is on the people to demonstrat e
voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence.” People v
Stewart, 512 Mich 472, 480-481 (2023) (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
Where the use of involuntary statements at trial violates a
defendant’s constitutional right to due process, th e
“defendant’s conviction may only stand if the prosecutor ca n
prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonabl e
doubt[.]” Stewart, 512 Mich at 501. “Reversal is required if the
average jury would have found the prosecution’s cas e
73 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 3-106 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
significantly less persuasive without the erroneously admitted
testimony.” Id. at 502 (quotation marks and citation omitted)
(holding defendant was entitled to a new trial because “the use
of [involuntary] statements at trial violated defendant’ s
constitutional rights, and the prosecution ha[d] not proved that
their admission at trial was harmless beyond a reasonabl e
doubt”).
In Cipriano, 431 Mich at 334, the Michigan Supreme Cour t
identified the following factors as relevant to determining
74
whether a defendant’s statement was voluntary:
(1) the age of the accused;
(2) the accused’s lack of education or intelligence
level;
(3) the extent of the accused’s previous experience
with the police;
(4) the repeated or prolonged nature of the
questioning;
(5) the length of detention before the accused gave
the statement;
(6) lack of any advice to the accused regarding hi s
or her constitutional rights;
(7) an unnecessary delay in bringing the accused
before a magistrate before the accused gave the
confession;
(8) whether the accused was injured, intoxicated,
drugged, or ill when he or she gave the statement;
(9) whether the accused was deprived of food,
sleep, or medical attention;
(10) whether the accused was physically abused;
and
(11) whether the accused was threatened wit h
abuse. Cipriano, 431 Mich at 334.
Mental incompetence. A defendant’s mental incompetenc e
alone does not render a defendant’s confession involuntary; fo r
a confession to be involuntary, evidence of police misconduc t
or coercion must exist. Colorado v Connelly, 479 US 157, 16 4
74 Known as the “Cipriano factors.”
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-107
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(1986). While psychological interrogation tactics may make a
suspect’s mental condition more significant, mental illness b y
itself and apart from its relation to official coercion should
never decide the question of voluntariness. Id. On numerous
occasions, the United States Supreme Court has referred to th e
education and IQ of a suspect in finding that he or she wa s
highly susceptible to coercion and that the police overpowered
the suspect’s will in obtaining an incriminating statement. Se e
Culombe v Connecticut, 367 US 568, 620 (1961) (involving a
defendant with an intelligence quotient of 64 and the mental
age of a 9-year-old); Spano v New York, 360 US 315, 316, 321-32 2
(1959) (involving a foreign-born defendant with a junior hig h
education who was described as “emotionally unstable”);
Payne v Arkansas, 356 US 560, 562 n 4 (1958) (involving a 19-
year-old with a fifth-grade education who was described a s
“mentally dull” and “slow to learn”).
Misrepresentation of evidence. “The fact that the police lie t o
a suspect about the evidence against him or her does no t
automatically render an otherwise voluntary statemen t
involuntary.” People v Perkins, 314 Mich App 140, 155 (2016),
vacated in part on other grounds by People v Perkins,
unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, issued Februar y
12, 2016 (Docket Nos. 323454; 323876; 325741) and People v
75
Hyatt, 316 Mich App 368 (2016). “Instead, misrepresentation
by the police is just one factor to be considered; the focu s
remains the totality of the circumstances.” Perkins, 314 Mic h
App at 155-156 (holding that where the totality of th e
circumstances demonstrated that the defendant’s statement t o
police was voluntary, he was not entitled to suppression of th e
statement on the ground that the investigating officer “lied t o
him about what evidence existed in the case”).
Age of defendant. “[T]he mere fact that defendant was 17
years old and inexperienced in the criminal justice system [did ]
not mean that he was ‘peculiarly susceptible to an appeal to hi s
conscience’ or ‘unusual[ly] susceptib[le] . . . to a particula r
form of persuasion’” within the meaning of Rhode Island v
Innis, 446 US 291, 302 (1980). People v White, 493 Mich 187, 20 3
(2013) (third and fourth alterations in the original). The Innis
Court concluded “that the Miranda safeguards come into pla y
whenever a person in custody is subjected to either expres s
questioning or its functional equivalent.” Innis, 446 US at 300-
301. “Miranda refers . . . to any words or actions on the part o f
the police . . . that the police should know are reasonably likely
75For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.” Innis, 446
US at 301.
Promise of leniency. “[A] statement induced by a law
enforcement official’s promise of leniency is involuntary and
inadmissible, if there was a promise of leniency and tha t
promise caused the defendant to confess.” People v Conte, 42 1
Mich 704, 712 (1984). To determine whether a promise o f
leniency exists requires an analysis of “whether the defendan t
reasonably understood the official’s statements to be a promis e
of leniency.” Id. To determine whether the officer’s promise of
leniency caused the defendant to confess requires an analysi s
of whether the defendant relied on the promise when he or sh e
decided to offer inculpatory evidence and whether, in fact, th e
promise of leniency prompted the defendant to make th e
incriminating statements. Id. “While general observation s
regarding leniency . . . will not render a statement involuntary,
express or implied assurances that cooperation will aid th e
interrogee’s defense or result in a lesser sentence may do so. ”
Stewart, ___ Mich at ___ (“promises of leniency remain onl y
one factor to be considered within the totality-of-the-
circumstances analysis”).
In Stewart, a police officer proposed that they quickly g o
through paperwork and then proceeded to ask defendan t
general questions although defendant “was still attendin g
secondary school and living with family,” and “made repeated
requests to call his mother[.]” Stewart, ___ Mich at ___. Th e
“defendant’s age and its attendant characteristics [were]
relevant” to the Court’s analysis, and conclusion tha t
“defendant’s age made him more susceptible to suggestion s
from law enforcement and less likely to engage in reasoned
decision-making.” Id. at ___ (clarifying that its “decision doe s
not create a bright-line rule that any statement by an 18-year-
old to law enforcement is involuntarily given”).
In addition to the Cipriano factors, courts “must also addres s
any other factual circumstances, psychological effects, and
coercive tactics employed by the officers that may hav e
contributed to an overbearing of the defendant’s free will. ”
Stewart, ___ Mich at ___. In this regard, “one such tactic
employed by law enforcement was the officers’ repeated and
specific references to leniency.” Id. at ___. The Stewart Cour t
stated that police officers “heavily implied” to defendant tha t
“you control your own destiny” and “emphasized that it wa s
defendant’s cooperation that determined . . . a lesser sentence. ”
Id. at ___ (noting the “transcript reflects that defendant took
these statements as an assurance”). “Given that the officer s
continued to make these implications of leniency, their limited
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-109
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
qualifying language was not sufficient to undo th e
implications’ coercive effect.” Id. at ___ (the impact of th e
officers’ promise of leniency was compounded by the fact tha t
“the officers also lied to defendant about the extent of th e
evidence against him” and “the overall tone of th e
interrogation was combative”). While “the length of th e
interrogation . . . was not excessively long,” defendant wa s
“advised of his constitutional rights,” did not “allege that h e
was injured intoxicated, or drugged,” and denied “that he wa s
physically abused” in Stewart, “[t]he totality of th e
circumstances of defendant’s interrogation—including his age,
the timing of the interrogation [during early morning hours
with an inference that defendant was sleep deprived], the
officers’ references to leniency, the officers’ use of falsehoods,
and the officers’ overall tone and use of language—created a n
environment in which defendant’s free will was overborne and
the statements he gave were involuntary.” Stewart, ___ Mich at
___.
4. Determining a Knowing and Intelligent Waiver
“In contrast to the voluntary prong, determining whether a
suspect’s waiver was knowing and intelligent requires a n
inquiry into the suspect’s level of understanding, irrespectiv e
of police behavior.” People v Daoud, 462 Mich 621, 636 (2000) .
[76]
“To knowingly waive Miranda rights, a suspect need no t
understand the ramifications and consequences of choosing t o
waive or exercise the rights that the police have properl y
explained to him.” People v Cheatham, 453 Mich 1, 28 (1996).
Rather, “Miranda requires that the accused be advised of hi s
rights so that he may make a rational decision, not necessaril y
the best one or one that would be reached only after long and
painstaking deliberation.” Id. (alteration and citation omitted).
“Lack of foresight is insufficient to render an otherwise proper
waiver invalid.” Id. at 29.
“To establish a valid waiver, the state must present evidenc e
sufficient to demonstrate that the accused understood that h e
did not have to speak, that he had the right to the presence o f
counsel, and that the state could use what he said in a later trial
against him.” Cheatham, 452 Mich at 29. “The test is no t
whether the defendant made an intelligent decision in th e
sense that it was wise or smart to admit his participation in th e
crime, but whether his decision was made with the full
understanding that he need say nothing at all and that h e
76Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 3-110 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
might then consult with a lawyer if he so desired.” Id.
(alterations and citation omitted).
The trial court’s factual findings regarding a defendant’ s
knowing and intelligent waiver of Miranda rights are reviewed
for clear error. Daoud, 462 Mich at 629.
5. Waiver Does Not Have to be Explicit
A waiver does not have to be explicit; it can be determined b y
the surrounding facts and circumstances. North Carolina v
Butler, 441 US 369, 375-376 (1979). “[I]n at least some case s
waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words o f
the person interrogated.” Id. at 373. However, “a valid waive r
will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused
after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a
confession was in fact eventually obtained.” Miranda v Arizona,
384 US 436, 475 (1966).
“[A] suspect who has received and understood the Miranda
warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda rights, waives th e
right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to th e
police.” Berghuis v Thompkins, 560 US 370, 388-389 (2010).
During the three-hour interview in Berghuis, 560 US at 376, 382,
the defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent, becaus e
he never said “that he wanted to remain silent or that he did
not want to talk with the police.” Further, the record
demonstrated that the defendant waived his right to remai n
silent by knowingly and voluntarily making a statement to th e
police, where: (1) “there [wa]s no contention that [he] did no t
understand his rights; and from this it follows that he kne w
what he gave up when he spoke”; (2) his response to a
detective’s question regarding “whether [he] prayed to God fo r
forgiveness for shooting the victim [wa]s a ‘course of conduc t
indicating waiver’ of the right to remain silent”; and (3) “ther e
[wa]s no evidence that [his] statement was coerced.” Id. at 385-
387, quoting Butler, 441 US at 373. Additionally, the police wer e
not required to obtain a waiver of the defendant’s right t o
remain silent before questioning him, because “after giving a
Miranda warning, police may interrogate a suspect who ha s
neither invoked nor waived his or her Miranda rights. ”
Berghuis, 560 US at 388.
“When a defendant speaks after receiving Miranda warnings, a
momentary pause or even a failure to answer a question wil l
not be construed as an affirmative invocation by the defendan t
of the right to remain silent.” People v McReavy, 436 Mich 197,
222 (1990). “[A] defendant who speaks following Miranda
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-111
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
warnings must affirmatively reassert the right to remai n
silent.” People v Davis, 191 Mich App 29, 35-36 (1991).
6. Timing of Waiver
“[T]here is a lack of agreement as to the admissibility o f
statements obtained through [a] ‘two-stage interrogation ’
[77]
practice, i.e., interviews that occur before Miranda warning s
and after Miranda warnings, as discussed in the plurality and
Justice Kennedy’s concurring opinions issued in [Missouri v
Seibert, 542 US 600 (2004)].” People v Lewinski, ___ Mich App
___, ___ n 7 (2024) (noting “there is no Michigan precedent o n
this issue”).
7. Reinitiated Communication by Defendant After
Invoking Miranda — Right to Counsel
“[T]here is no bright-line rule that, in the absence of rereadin g
[78]
the person his Miranda rights a second time when
discussions are reinitiated [by a defendant after invoking his o r
her Miranda rights], the person’s subsequent statements mus t
be suppressed. Rather, the test is whether, under the totality o f
the circumstances, the person voluntarily, knowingly, and
intelligently waived his right to counsel and to remain silent. ”
People v Clark, 330 Mich App 392, 398 (2019). “The fact tha t
police officers do not again fully advise the defendant of hi s
Miranda rights after he reinitiates communication with them i s
just one factor to consider under to totality of th e
circumstances.” Id. at 419, 421 (finding that because the tim e
lapse of a few minutes “between when defendant initiall y
invoked his right to counsel, reinitiated discussion, and the n
began talking again with the officers,” the officers’ reminder t o
defendant “that his Miranda rights were recently read t o
him . . . was adequate under the circumstances”).
“[W]hen a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, ‘a valid
waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only tha t
he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogatio n
even if he has been advised of his rights.’” People v Burnett, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2025), quoting Edwards v Arizona, 451 U S
477, 484 (1981). In Burnett, defendant “unequivocally invoked
his right to an attorney, and the detectives continued th e
interview.” Id. at ___ (“conclud[ing] that saying, ‘I want m y
lawyer’ is a clear, unequivocal, and present demand for a n
77 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
78 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 3-112 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
attorney”). “While defendant added that he ‘will b e
comfortable’ with a lawyer because he did not ‘know th e
system,’ this comment was an explanation for why he wa s
presently demanding an attorney, and it in no way rendered
defendant’s statement ‘I want my lawyer’ equivocal o r
ambiguous.” Id. at ___. “Even though the detective s
subsequently provided Miranda rights, defendant’s waiver of
those rights was invalid.” Id. at ___. “Defendant did no t
independently re-initiate contact with the detectives after h e
invoked his right to counsel; rather, after he was permitted t o
speak with his mother, he was brought back into th e
interrogation room and the interview continued.” Id. at ___.
“This shows that defendant’s right to end questioning until h e
had an attorney present was not ‘scrupulously honored.’” Id. a t
___ (citation omitted). “Instead, it was completely ignored.” Id.
at ___. “The trial court therefore should have grante d
defendant’s motion to suppress.” Id. at ___.
8. Cases Involving Valid Waiver
Hearing-impaired defendant. A preponderance of the
evidence proved that a deaf-mute defendant knowingly,
intelligently, and voluntarily waived her Miranda rights whe n
she made inculpatory statements during interrogation after a
detective placed a constitutional rights form within th e
defendant’s range of vision, read portions of the form aloud
while a sign language interpreter signed and mouthed th e
detective’s words to the defendant, and the defendant signe d
the form. People v McBride, 480 Mich 1047 (2008); People v
McBride, 273 Mich App 238, 240-244 (2006).
Reinitiated communication by defendant after invokin g
Miranda. Defendant’s waiver was valid where “[t]he time
lapse between when defendant initially invoked his right t o
counsel, reinitated discussions, and then began talking agai n
with the officers was only a few minutes”; “the officer s
reminded defendant that his Miranda rights were recently rea d
to him, and he continued talking with the officers.” People v
Clark, 330 Mich App 392, 421 (2019). “Given the brief time
lapse, the reminder was adequate under the circumstances[.] ”
Id.
Intoxication. A defendant made a voluntary, knowing, and
intelligent waiver of his right against self-incrimination, eve n
when he was intoxicated and suicidal at the time of th e
confession. People v Tierney, 266 Mich App 687, 709-710 (2005).
The Tierney Court affirmed the trial court’s analysis of the
79
Cipriano factors and emphasized that a defendant’ s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-113
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
intoxication was only one of the eleven Cipriano factors. Tierney,
266 Mich App at 709-710. The Court noted that any effect tha t
the defendant’s intoxication may have had on the defendan t
was significantly outweighed by other factors, including th e
defendant’s college education, his experience with the criminal
justice system, the absence of any threats, and the fact tha t
necessities (e.g., medical care) were not withheld from th e
defendant during police questioning. Id. at 709. See also People
v Leighty, 161 Mich App 565, 571 (1987) (severe intoxicatio n
from drugs or alcohol may preclude an effective waiver o f
Miranda rights, but it is not dispositive; the totality of th e
circumstances must be examined).
Subsequent interrogation. Notwithstanding the fact that the
suspect was not held in continuous custody between his firs t
interrogation (at which he requested counsel and denie d
involvement in the crime), and his second interrogation 1 1
days later (at which he acknowledged his right to counsel an d
implicated himself in the crime), the defendant executed a
valid waiver of his right to counsel at the second interrogation.
People v Harris, 261 Mich App 44, 55 (2004). Two police officer s
involved in the defendant’s interrogation refuted th e
defendant’s claim that he requested counsel at the second
interrogation, and the prosecution’s evidence included th e
defendant’s videotaped acknowledgment of his right t o
counsel and a signed waiver of that right. Id.
E. Custodial Interrogation
[80]
“[N]either Miranda’s right to be given a series of warnings nor
[81]
Edwards’s right to have counsel present apply absent custodial
82
interrogation[.]” People v Elliott, 494 Mich 292, 304 (2013). “If th e
accused is never subjected to custodial interrogation after he ha s
invoked his right to counsel, Edwards is inapplicable[; i]n other
words, according to Edwards, the [Fifth Amendment] right the
accused invokes under Miranda is the right to have counsel presen t
during custodial interrogation[, and] . . . [i]n the absence of a post-
invocation custodial interrogation, there can be no infringement of
that right.” Elliott, 494 Mich at 303, 305 (further holding that because
“defendant was not subjected to custodial interrogation by the
parole officer” to whom he made incriminating statements, it wa s
unnecessary to “consider whether a parole officer . . . may be

considered a law enforcement officer for purposes of Miranda”)
(citation omitted).
Custodial interrogation is defined as “questioning initiated by law
enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or
otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.”
Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436, 444 (1966).“The determinatio n
whether a person is considered to be ‘in-custody’ with respect to a n
interrogation is a two-part inquiry, focusing on the freedom of
movement and the environment.” People v Lewinski, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2024). “The first step is to ascertain whether, in light of the
objective circumstances of the interrogation, a reasonable perso n
would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the
interrogation and leave.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). The second step in determining “whether defendant wa s
‘in-custody’ for purposes of deciding whether he was subjected t o
custodial interrogation under Miranda” is “whether the relevan t
environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the
type of station house questioning at issue in Miranda.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citations omitted).
1. Custody
“For an interrogation to be ‘custodial,’ the suspect must be i n
‘custody.’” People v Wade, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025).
“‘Custody’ in this context is a term of art that specifie s
circumstances that are thought generally to present a seriou s
danger of coercion.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “Miranda warnings are not required ‘whenever a
suspect is in custody in a technical sense’; they are required
only when the ‘essential ingredients of a police-dominated
atmosphere’ and coercion are present.” Id. at ___, quoting
Illinois v Perkins, 496 US 292, 296-297 (1990). “It follows tha t
ploys designed to mislead a jailed or imprisoned suspect, or t o
lull him into a false sense of security, do not trigger Miranda’ s
protections unless the ploy rises to the level of compulsion o r
coercion.” Wade, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up). “Coercio n
is determined from the perspective of the suspect.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Wade, “[w]hen defendant spoke with [his then-girlfriend],
he was in custody in the technical sense—he was incarcerate d
[for unrelated reasons].” Id. at ___. “But defendant’ s
conversation with [her] did not occur in the type of coercive
atmosphere giving rise to Miranda concerns.” Id. at ___. “Fro m
defendant’s perspective, he was merely talking with hi s
girlfriend, and he surely believed that he was free to terminat e
the conversation at any time.” Id. at ___ (citation omitted).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-115
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“Indeed, given defendant’s threatening attitude toward [hi s
then-girlfriend], it is difficult to imagine that he wa s
intimidated by her or thought that she had any power o r
authority over him, official or otherwise.” Id. at ___. “While th e
police used [her] to deceive defendant and lull him into a fals e
sense of security, nothing about this deception or th e
circumstances surrounding defendant’s conversation wit h
[her] compelled or coerced defendant to talk to her.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “It follows tha t
Miranda warnings were not required, and defendant’s Fift h
Amendments [sic] right against self-incrimination was no t
violated.” Id. at ___.
“Custody is a term of art that specifies circumstances that ar e
thought generally to present a serious danger of coercion. ”
People v Lewinski, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up).
Indeed, “not all restraints on an individual’s freedom of
movement are tantamount to custody for purposes of decidin g
whether a person has been subjected to custodial interrogatio n
83
under Miranda.” Lewinski, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “[I]n order to determine how a
suspect would have gauged his or her freedom of movement,
courts must examine all of the circumstances surrounding th e
interrogation.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “The relevant factors to consider include: (1) th e
location of the questioning, (2) the duration of the questioning,
(3) statements made during the interview, (4) the presence o r
absence of physical restraints during the questioning, and (5 )
the release of the interviewee at the end of the questioning.” Id.
at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “No on e
circumstance is controlling; rather, a reviewing Court mus t
consider the totality of the circumstances when decidin g
whether an individual was subjected to custodial interrogatio n
under Miranda.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
In Lewinski, “[a]lthough the police questioning occurred in a
hospital room, not a police station, and the police did not tak e
defendant to the hospital,” location was a neutral facto r
“because the detectives were standing in a location tha t
effectively blocked defendant’s exit and defendant was activel y
being treated in the hospital which placed him in a mor e
compromised and vulnerable state so that he more than likel y
would not have felt free to leave or terminate the interview.” Id.
at ___ (“[T]he interview’s 69-minute duration [was also] a
neutral factor.”).
83 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 3-116 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
Considering that defendant was never told he was free to leave
and that defendant made incriminating statements shortly
after the interview started and detectives continued
questioning the defendant before giving him Miranda
warnings, the statements made during the interview factor
“weigh[ed] in favor of finding that defendant would not hav e
felt free to leave or terminate the interview.” Id. at ___.
“Regarding the presence or absence of physical restraint s
during the questioning, generally, the lack of handcuffs weigh s
against a finding of custody.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
“However, other forms of restraint may support a finding of
custody.” Id. at ___ (finding that “this factor weigh[ed] in favo r
of a finding that defendant would not have felt free to leave o r
terminate the interview”). The factor regarding “release of th e
interviewee at the end of the questioning” weighed “in favor o f
defendant being in custody” because “defendant was arrested
about 27 minutes into questioning and was not released at th e
end of the interview.” Id. at ___. “Finally, regarding the issue of
whether or not a reasonable person would believe he or sh e
was free to leave or terminate the interview,” a police officer’ s
testimony that he decided the defendant “was not free to leav e
just two minutes into the interrogation” was “not relevant t o
the issue of whether a reasonable person in defendant’ s
situation would believe they were free to leave or terminate th e
interview.” Id. at ___.
Turning to the second consideration, the Lewinski Court found
that, considering the totality of the circumstances, the pre-
Miranda interrogation “did not take place in an unduly
coercive environment.” Id. at ___ (noting that “there was n o
time when the questioning . . . could be described a s
accusatory,” and “defendant was never placed in a police car
or taken to a police station during the interrogation”).
Accordingly, “defendant was not in custody at the time of th e
pre-Miranda interrogation, and consequently, defendant’ s
incriminating statements were not gained in violation of hi s
Miranda rights.” Id. at ___.
“The determination of custody depends on the objectiv e
circumstances of the interrogation rather than the subjectiv e
views harbored by either the interrogating officers or th e
person being questioned.” People v Zahn, 234 Mich App 438,
449 (1999).
2. Interrogation
“Statements made by a defendant to the police during a
custodial interrogation are not admissible unless the defendan t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-117
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waives th e
constitutional right against self-incrimination.” People v Lafey,
[84]
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). “For purposes of Miranda ,
interrogation refers to express questioning or its functiona l
equivalent.” Lafey, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “In other words, interrogation refers t o
express questioning and to any words or actions on the part o f
police that the police should know are reasonably likely t o
elicit an incriminating response from the subject.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up). “Statements made voluntarily by persons i n
custody do not fall within the purview of Miranda.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted). In Lafey, the defendan t
made a “spontaneous, inculpatory statement” after “the polic e
officers had concluded their questioning of him.” Lafey, __ _
Mich App at ___ (noting that “defendant made his statemen t
voluntarily and without prompting from the officers” and tha t
the police officer’s “response of ‘What?’ to defendant’ s
statement . . . did not arise to the level of interrogation”).
“Where a statement is spontaneous and only followed with a
clarifying question from an officer, it is not given shelter b y
Miranda.” Lafey, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
Interrogation involves questioning or its functional equivalen t
which includes “any words or actions on the part of the polic e
(other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody )
that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit a n
incriminating response from the suspect.” Rhode Island v Innis,
446 US 291, 301 (1980).
3. Questioning a Child
The age of a child subjected to police questioning “properl y
[85]
informs the Miranda custody analysis.” JDB v North Carolina,
564 US 261, 265 (2011). “[A] reasonable child subjected t o
police questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submi t
when a reasonable adult would feel free to go. . . . [C]ourts ca n
account for that reality without doing any damage to th e
objective nature of the custody analysis.” Id. at 272. Althoug h
officers are not required to consider a suspect’s subjective stat e
of mind or other unknowable circumstances, a child’s age is a
fact that “yields objective conclusions” that “are self-evident t o
anyone who was a child once . . . , including any police officer
or judge”; thus, “a child’s age differs from other personal
84 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
85 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 3-118 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
characteristics that, even when known to police, have n o
objectively discernible relationship to a reasonable person’ s
understanding of his freedom of action.” Id. at 271-272, 275.
Cautioning that “a child’s age will [not] be a determinative, o r
even a significant, factor in every case,” the Court concluded
that “so long as the child’s age was known to the officer at th e
time of police questioning, or would have been objectivel y
apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custod y
analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test.” Id.
at 277.
4. Questioning a Motorist
“[A] motorist detained for a routine traffic stop or investigativ e
stop is ordinarily not in custody within the meaning o f
86
Miranda.” People v Steele, 292 Mich App 308, 317 (2011).
5. Questioning a Prisoner
There is no “categorical rule . . . that the questioning of a
87
prisoner is always custodial [within the meaning of Miranda ]
when the prisoner is removed from the general priso n
population and questioned about events that occurred outsid e
the prison.” Howes v Fields, 565 US 499, 505 (2012). Rather,
“[w]hen a prisoner is questioned, the determination of custod y
should focus on all of the features of th e
interrogation, . . . includ[ing] the language that is used i n
summoning the prisoner to the interview and the manner i n
which the interrogation is conducted.” Id. at 514, 516-517.
Similarly, “[w]here . . . a parolee is incarcerated for an allege d
parole violation, ‘custodial’ means more than just the norma l
restrictions that exist as a result of the incarceration.” People v
Elliott, 494 Mich 292, 305-306 (2013). “[T]he first constitutional
step is to determine ‘whether an individual’s freedom o f
movement was curtailed[.]’ If so, the court should then ask ‘th e
additional question whether the relevant environmen t
presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the type o f
station house questioning at issue in Miranda.’ Thus, ‘[n]ot all
restraints on freedom of movement amount to custody fo r
purposes of Miranda.’” Elliott, 494 Mich at 308, quoting Fields,
565 US at 509.
A break in custody of 14 days ends the presumption o f
involuntariness established in Edwards v Arizona, 451 US 47 7

(1981), because that duration “provides plenty of time for th e
suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life, to consult wit h
friends and counsel, and to shake off any residual coerciv e
effects of his prior custody.” Maryland v Shatzer, 559 US 98, 11 0
(2010). The Court also held that when an individual i s
interrogated while in prison for an unrelated crime, release d
back into the general prison population, then questioned agai n
at a later time, the situation constitutes a break in custody fo r
purposes of Miranda. Shatzer, 559 US at 112-114. According t o
the Court, “[w]ithout minimizing the harsh realities o f
incarceration, we think lawful imprisonment imposed upo n
conviction of a crime does not create the coercive pressure s
identified in Miranda.” Id. at 113.
6. Questioning by a Non-Police Actor
Individuals not acting on the government’s behalf may not b e
88
required to give Miranda warnings before eliciting a
statement. See People v Anderson, 209 Mich App 527, 533-534
(1995) (a juvenile corrections officer whose job duties did no t
require the interrogation of suspects, who did not wear a
badge or uniform or carry a gun, and who did not hav e
authority to arrest or detain citizens, was not required to give a
defendant Miranda warnings). See also People v Porterfield, 16 6
Mich App 562, 567 (1988) (a protective services caseworker no t
charged with enforcement of criminal laws and not acting o n
behalf of police, is not required to advise an individual o f
Miranda rights); People v Faulkner, 90 Mich App 520, 525 (1979)
(a private investigator is not required to advise individuals o f
their constitutional rights before eliciting a statement).
“Miranda warnings are not required ‘whenever a suspect is i n
custody in a technical sense’; they are required only when th e
‘essential ingredients of a police-dominated atmosphere’ an d
coercion are present.” Id. at ___, quoting Illinois v Perkins, 49 6
US 292, 296-297 (1990). “It follows that ploys designed t o
mislead a jailed or imprisoned suspect, or to lull him into a
false sense of security, do not trigger Miranda’s protection s
unless the ploy rises to the level of compulsion or coercion. ”
Wade, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up). “Coercion is
determined from the perspective of the suspect.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Wade, “[w]hen defendant spoke with [his then-girlfriend],
he was in custody in the technical sense—he was incarcerated
[for unrelated reasons].” Id. at ___. “But defendant’ s
88 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 3-120 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
conversation with [her] did not occur in the type of coerciv e
atmosphere giving rise to Miranda concerns.” Id. at ___. “Fro m
defendant’s perspective, he was merely talking with hi s
girlfriend, and he surely believed that he was free to terminat e
the conversation at any time.” Id. at ___ (citation omitted).
“Indeed, given defendant’s threatening attitude toward [hi s
then-girlfriend], it is difficult to imagine that he wa s
intimidated by her or thought that she had any power o r
authority over him, official or otherwise.” Id. at ___. “While th e
police used [her] to deceive defendant and lull him into a fals e
sense of security, nothing about this deception or th e
circumstances surrounding defendant’s conversation wit h
[her] compelled or coerced defendant to talk to her.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “It follows tha t
Miranda warnings were not required, and defendant’s Fift h
Amendments [sic] right against self-incrimination was no t
violated.” Id. at ___.
7. Custodial Interrogation Existed
• Edwards v Arizona, 451 US 477, 487 (1981) (custodial
interrogation existed where the defendant invoked
his right to counsel, the police stopped questioning
him, the police returned to him the next day and
89
advised him of his Miranda rights again, and
defendant subsequently made an incriminating
statement; the “statement made without having had
access to counsel, did not amount to a valid waiver
and hence was inadmissible”).
• People v Kelly, 505 Mich 933 (2019) (custodial
interrogation existed where the defendant wa s
handcuffed and under restraint when questioned).
• People v Barritt, 325 Mich App 556, 574, 575-576, 582-
583, 584 (2018) (custodial interrogation existed and
defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights were violated
where there totality of the circumstances showed tha t
defendant “was always in the company of at least one
armed officer”; “he was told by the police to get int o
the back of a police car”; his “dog had been forcibly
removed from the home by animal-control officers”;
“[h]e was not able to drive to the police station in the
same car that brought him to the house, despite the
fact that the police had told defendant’s driver t o
drive to the very same police station”; he “did not ge t
to arrange the time of the interview, the place of the
89 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-121
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
interview, or when the interview would conclude”;
and “[a]t the end of the interview defendant wa s
handcuffed and placed in another police vehicle.”
The “mode of transportation implie[d] a physica l
restraint regardless of whether . . . defendan t
voluntarily accepted the ride.” Further, whether
defendant was told he was free to leave was relevant,
and the fact that he was not told until the end of the
interview (and after he stated he needed a lawyer)
that he was not under arrest and could finis h
anytime, weighed in favor of finding custody. The
accusatory nature of the questioning also weighed i n
favor of finding custody because it “would lead a
reasonable person to perceive that they were not free
90
to leave[.]”).
8. Custodial Interrogation Did Not Exist
• People v Wade, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (Ther e
was no custodial interrogation where the defendan t
made incriminating statements on the telephone to
his then-girlfriend while he was incarcerated for
unrelated reasons; although “the police used [her] t o
deceive defendant and lull him into a false sense of
security, nothing about this deception or the
circumstances surrounding defendant’s conversatio n
with [her] compelled or coerced defendant to talk t o
her.” “From defendant’s perspective, he was merely
talking with his girlfriend, and he surely believed tha t
he was free to terminate the conversation at any
time.” “It follows that Miranda warnings were no t
required, and defendant’s Fifth Amendments [sic]
right against self-incrimination was not violated”).
• People v Lewinski, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (Ther e
was no custodial interrogation where the defendan t
made incriminating statements from his hospital be d
in response to nonaccusatory questions fro m
detectives; although “a reasonable individual in th e
circumstances surrounding defendant’s interrogatio n
would not have felt free to leave or terminate the
interview,” “defendant was not in custody prior t o
the time he received the
Miranda[91]
warnings ”
because the interrogation “did not take place in a n
unduly coercive environment.”).
90The facts in Barritt were sufficient to support a finding of custody even though defendant was not
handcuffed during the interrogation. However, the mere presence of a police dog in the interrogation roo m
did not impose “a physical restraint on defendant’s freedom to move.” Barritt, 325 Mich App at 578.
91 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 3-122 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
• People v Lafey, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (Ther e
was no custodial interrogation where the defendan t
made a spontaneous, inculpatory statement during a
pat-down after the police officers concluded their
interrogation and were preparing to transpor t
defendant to the police cruiser; “the record [did] no t
support the assertion that the pat-down search wa s
conducted to elicit an incriminating response fro m
defendant” and “was conducted immediately before
defendant was removed from the house and placed i n
a police cruiser.” “[The pat-down] was performed i n
the course of arresting defendant and was aimed a t
securing defendant for transport and to ensure officer
safety.”).
• Howes v Fields, 565 US 499, 514, 516-517 (2012) (ther e
was no custodial interrogation where the respondent,
a jail inmate, was escorted to a conference room and
questioned by officers regarding allegations that he
had committed an unrelated offense prior to hi s
incarceration; “[t]aking into account all of the
circumstances of the questioning,” including that the
respondent was not physically restrained or
threatened, that he was interviewed under condition s
that were not uncomfortable, and, “especially . . . tha t
[he] was told that he was free to end the questioning
and to return to his cell, . . . respondent was not i n
custody within the meaning of Miranda92 ”). 93
• People v Elliott, 494 Mich 292, 297-299, 308-313 (2013)
(Defendant was not subjected to custodial
interrogation when his first interrogation about a
robbery was discontinued after he requested a n
attorney, then subsequently met with a differen t
parole officer at the jail who served him with a n
amended notice of parole violation and during the
meeting, confessed to his involvement in the robbery.
“[D]efendant was not subjected to the type of coercive
pressure against which Miranda was designed t o
guard” because “the meeting . . . took place in the jail
library, it was of short duration (15 to 25 minutes),
defendant was not physically restrained, . . . he wa s
escorted to the library by a deputy, not by the parole
officer,” he “was not free to leave the jail library by
92 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
93 Cf. Mathis v United States, 391 US 1, 3-5 (1968) (holding that a state prisoner was entitled to Miranda
warnings before being questioned by a federal revenue agent, and rejecting the Government’s assertion s
that Miranda was inapplicable where “(1) . . . the[] questions were asked as a part of a routine ta x
investigation where no criminal proceedings might even [have been] brought, and (2) . . . the [prisoner ]
had not been put in jail by the officers questioning him, but was there for an entirely separate offense”).

himself,” and “much like the prisoner in Fields, a
‘reasonable person’ in defendant’s ‘position,’ i.e., a
parolee, would be aware that a parole officer is actin g
independently of the police who placed him i n
custody and has no control over the jail, its staff, or
the individuals incarcerated there.” Additionally,
“there [was] no evidence of coercion or any other
manner of psychological intimidation[, and]
. . . defendant . . . did not even once indicate that h e
did not want to talk to the parole officer.”).
• People v White, 493 Mich 187, 191-192, 195, 198-200,
202, 204-206 (2013) (Where defendant asserted hi s
right to remain silent after an officer provided hi m
with Miranda warnings, the officer’s statement to th e
17-year-old defendant that he “‘hope[d] that the gu n
[was] in a place where nobody [could] get a hold of i t
and nobody else [could] get hurt by it’” did no t
constitute either “‘express questioning or it s
94
functional equivalent’” under Innis, and the tria l
court therefore erred in suppressing the defendant’ s
subsequent incriminating statements. “The officer’ s
comment . . . was not a question because it did no t
ask for an answer or invite a response[, but instead]
was a mere expression of hope and concern[,
and] . . . the officer’s addition of the words ‘okay’ an d
‘all right’ at the end of his comment did not transfor m
a non-question into a question” where he had
“repeatedly used [these] words . . . in a manner tha t
failed to garner any response from defendant.”
“Furthermore, immediately before the officer made
the statement at issue, he said, ‘I’m not asking yo u
questions, I’m just telling you.’ Although this [was]
certainly not dispositive of whether what follow[ed]
constituted a ‘question,’ . . . [t]he very utterance itsel f
made it less likely either that the officer would have
reasonably expected defendant to answer with a n
incriminating response or that defendant would hav e
proffered an incriminating response.” The officer’ s
comment about the location of the gun was a “direc t
statement[] to the defendant,” but because there wa s
“nothing in the record to suggest that the officer wa s
aware that defendant was ‘peculiarly susceptible t o
an appeal to his conscience’ concerning the safety of
others,” and because “the officer’s remark [was not]
‘particularly “evocative,”’” the “defendant was no t
subjected to the ‘functional equivalent’ of expres s
questioning[.]”95

F. Motion to Suppress Confession (Walker Hearing)
A defendant may move to suppress their confession at a hearing
typically called a Walker hearing. People v Walker (On Rehearing), 37 4
Mich 331, 338 (1965). Hearings on the admissibility of confession s
98
must be conducted outside the presence of the jury. MRE 104(c)(1).
A defendant in a criminal case does not become subject to cross-
examination on other issues in the case by testifying. MRE 104(d).
The rules of evidence do not apply to Walker hearings, except those
on privileges. MRE 104(a); People v Richardson, 204 Mich App 71, 80
(1994).
The prosecution bears the burden of showing the admissibility of a
confession. Brown v Illinois, 422 US 590, 604 (1975).
1. Common Challenges to Confessions
Illegal arrest/unlawful detention. There must be a warrant or
probable cause to arrest, or the detention is illegal and “an y
evidence obtained as a result of that unlawful detention or an y
statement made [by an individual] while unlawfully detaine d
must be suppressed.” People v Lewis, 160 Mich App 20, 25
(1987). See also People v Dowdy, 211 Mich App 562, 569 (1995),
where an initial warrantless entry was unconstitutional but a
defendant’s statement was admissible because it was mad e
after police had probable cause to arrest the defendant. T o
determine whether the illegal arrest caused the confession, th e
court should consider the time between the illegal arrest an d
confession, whether the official misconduct was flagrant,
whether there were intervening circumstances, and any event s
that occurred before the arrest. People v Mallory, 421 Mich 229,
243 n 8 (1984).
Where the defendant comes forward with proof that his or he r
confession was involuntary and was obtained as a result of a
statutorily unlawful detention, the prosecution has the burde n
of proving that the confession was voluntary and admissible.
People v Jordan, 149 Mich App 568, 577 (1986). See Sectio n
3.14(D)(3) for more information on voluntariness.
Unreasonable prearraignment delay. Generally, the cour t
should make a probable cause determination within 48 hour s
of a defendant’s arrest. See Riverside v McLaughlin, 500 US 44,
56 (1991). A confession obtained during an unreasonabl e
98MRE 104(c) also requires that the court to conduct any hearing on a preliminary question so that the jur y
cannot hear it when “a defendant in a criminal case is a witness and so requests” or “justice so requires.”
MRE 104(c)(2)-(3).
Page 3-126 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
prearraignment delay may be inadmissible. Mallory, 421 Mic h
at 243; People v White, 392 Mich 404, 424 (1974). “[W]here the
delay has been employed as a tool to extract the statement, th e
exclusionary rule will be imposed even if the statement wa s
given voluntarily.” Jordan, 149 Mich App at 577. Although th e
“48 hour” rule established in Riverside, 500 US at 44, forms a
presumption of unreasonableness, the delay is only one facto r
to be considered in determining whether the statement wa s
involuntary. People v Manning, 243 Mich App 615, 642-643
(2000). “The proper analysis is voluntariness under th e
[99]
Cipriano factors.” Id. at 643. See Section 3.14(D)(3) for mor e
information on voluntariness.
G. Scope/Applicability of Exclusionary Rule
Miranda warnings are constitutionally required and apply to th e
admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogations i n
both federal and state courts. Dickerson v United States, 530 US 428,
432, 442 (2000). Confessions obtained in violation of a defendant’ s
Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incriminatio n
are not admissible. Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436, 474-477 (1966);
People v Hill, 429 Mich 382, 394-395 (1987). If a defendant asserts hi s
or her right to counsel, the interrogation must cease until counsel i s
present, or, after the lapse of a significant period of time, the
defendant knowingly and intelligently waives his or her right t o
counsel. People v Parker, 84 Mich App 447, 457 (1978).
“Application of the exclusionary rule to a constitutional violation i s
a question of law that is reviewed de novo.” People v Frazier, 47 8
Mich 231, 240 (2007).
1. Testimonial vs. Physical Evidence
The Miranda rule bars only testimonial, not physical
100
evidence. United States v Patane, 542 US 630, 636 (2004).
Physical (nontestimonial) evidence obtained as a direct resul t
of unwarned but voluntary statements given in violation o f
Miranda is not covered by the exclusionary rule. Patane, 542 U S
at 637. See People v Campbell, 329 Mich App 185, 204-205 (2019),
where the trial court erred by suppressing evidence at tria l
when a police officer had failed to give the defendant Mirand a
warnings before conducting additional questioning and th e
99People v Cipriano, 431 Mich 315 (1988).
100 “A law enforcement official interrogating an individual in custodial detention regarding the individual’s
involvement in the commission of a major felony” must capture the entire interrogation, includin g
notification of a defendant’s Miranda rights, in a time-stamped, audiovisual recording. MCL 763.8(2). See
Section 3.14(B)(2) for discussion of major felony recordings.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-127
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
court did not find that the defendant’s admission wa s
involuntary. In Campbell, a police officer asked the defendant i f
he had any weapons inside the vehicle following a traffic stop.
Id. at 190. Defendant admitted he had a firearm, and upo n
additional questioning by the officer, that he did not have a
CPL. Id. at 190-191. Defendant was then advised “that h e
would be arrested for having a gun in his vehicle withou t
being licensed to carry a concealed weapon.” Id. at 203
(defendant “was undoubtedly in custody at that point as n o
reasonable person could have believed he or she was free t o
leave”). Subsequently, “without advising [defendant] of hi s
rights as required by Miranda,” the officer asked defendant “i f
he had any other weapons in the vehicle, promptin g
[defendant] to disclose the location of two additional loade d
guns.” Campbell, 329 Mich App at 203. “[T]he trial cour t
correctly ruled that [defendant’s] statement regarding th e
second and third guns was inadmissible.” Id. However,
“application of the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained as a
result of a Miranda violation is not a foregone conclusion
because a violation of Miranda is not, in and of itself, a violatio n
of the Constitution.” Campbell, 329 Mich App at 204-205 (th e
court “erred by suppressing the second and third guns on th e
101
basis of a Miranda violation”).
2. Public Safety Exception
The Miranda rule does not apply “in all its rigor to a situatio n
in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted b y
a concern for the public safety.” New York v Quarles, 467 US 649,
656 (1984); People v Attebury, 463 Mich 662, 670 (2001). T o
excuse the Miranda warnings, the circumstances must presen t
an immediate threat to public or police safety and th e
questions posed to the accused must be objectively and
reasonably necessary to protect the public or the police from a n
immediate danger. Quarles, 467 US at 655-658; Attebury, 46 3
Mich at 664, 670-671, 674 (officers executing an arrest warran t
for assault with a dangerous weapon were justified i n
questioning the defendant about the location of his gun befor e
giving him Miranda warnings, where the questioning wa s
“directly related to an objectively reasonable need to secur e
protection from the possibility of immediate danger associate d
with the gun”).
101See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 11, for informatio n
on search and seizure issues, including the exclusionary rule.
Page 3-128 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
3. No Police Misconduct
In the absence of police misconduct, the exclusionary rule doe s
not apply to prohibit the admission of evidence obtained as a
result of a defendant’s confession even when the defendant’ s
confession was obtained in violation of the defendant’s Sixt h
Amendment right to counsel and is inadmissible in th e
prosecution’s case-in-chief. See People v Frazier, 478 Mich 231,
250 (2007). The exclusionary rule does not apply becaus e
excluding a confession (and evidence discovered as a result o f
the confession) that did not result from police misconduc t
would not further the purpose of the exclusionary rule—t o
deter future police misconduct. Id. at 252.
After consulting with an attorney, to whom defendan t
admitted being present for but denied any advance knowledg e
or involvement in a robbery and double-homicide, defendan t
insisted on talking to police following his arrest and
arraignment. Frazier, 478 Mich at 236. Based on defendant’ s
assertion of non-involvement, “defense counsel advised
defendant that one option would be to talk to the police and
tell the truth.” Id. Defense counsel was present when
102
defendant was given his Miranda warnings, but counsel did
not remain for the interrogation “because he assumed that h e
could not be present during questioning.” Id. Despite
previously informing defense counsel that he did not have an y
advance knowledge of the robbery and murders, defendan t
admitted during the interrogation “that he knew [the
perpetrator] had been armed and had intended to rob th e
victims.” Id. at 236-237. Defendant further admitted that the
perpetrator “paid him with two $50 bills after the murders, ”
“that two street sweepers gave him a ride home after th e
murders and he asked them to change a $50 bill.” Id. at 237.
“The police later located the street sweepers, who testified tha t
defendant approached them for a ride . . . and asked if they
had change for a $50 bill.” Id. The Frazier Court concluded the
exclusionary rule did not apply to the testimony of the stree t
sweepers because “defendant’s confession did not result fro m
police misconduct,” and “the purpose of the exclusionary rul e
[was] in no way served by excluding the street sweepers ’
testimony.” Id. at 235. The Frazier Court further commented
that even if the defendant’s confession did result from polic e
misconduct, the exclusionary rule did not apply because an y
connection between the misconduct involved in obtaining th e
defendant’s confession, and the witness’s testimony obtained
as a result, was sufficiently attenuated to dissipate any taint. Id.
102Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-129
Section 3.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
at 253. “Under the attenuation exception to the exclusionar y
rule, exclusion is improper when the connection between th e
illegality and the discovery of the challenged evidence ha s
become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint[.] Attenuatio n
can occur when the causal connection is remote or when th e
interest protected by the constitutional guarantee that has bee n
violated would not be served by suppression of the evidenc e
obtained.” Id. (quotation marks and citations omitted).
4. Evidence of Defendant’s Silence Generally
Inadmissible
Generally, a defendant’s silence with the police after arrest and
having received Miranda warnings is inadmissible at trial.
103
People v Boyd, 470 Mich 363, 374-375 (2004). See also People v
Clary, 494 Mich 260, 271-272 (2013) (holding that the prosecuto r
improperly referred to the defendant’s failure, “after he wa s
arrested and arraigned, [to tell] the police that he did not shoo t
the complainant”). However, an arrested defendant’s silenc e
after Miranda may be used against the defendant if he or sh e
“testifies to an exculpatory version of events and claims t o
have told the police the same version upon arrest.” Doyle v
Ohio, 426 US 610, 619 n 11 (1976). See also Boyd, 470 Mich at
374-375.
“[A] defendant’s nonverbal conduct [such as sitting with hi s
head in his hands, looking down] cannot be characterized a s
‘silence’ that is inadmissible per se under the Michiga n
Constitution.” People v McReavy, 436 Mich 197, 205, 222 (1990).
“‘[T]he Fifth Amendment is not violated when a defendan t
who testifies in his own defense is impeached with his prio r
silence’ at his first trial. Jenkins[ v Anderson, 447 US 231, 23 5
(1980)], citing Raffel v United States, [271 US 494 (1926)].” Clary,
494 Mich at 266, 272, 280 (noting that “even though this [type
of] silence is . . . post-Miranda silence, . . . Raffel has not bee n
overruled by . . . any . . . United States Supreme Cour t
decision,” and holding that where the defendant did not testif y
at his first trial, which ended in a mistrial, he was no t
“improperly impeached with his silence when the prosecuto r
[at the retrial] made repeated references to his failure to testif y
104
at his first trial”).
103 See Section 3.14(C) for discussion of asserting Miranda rights.
104 The defendant’s convictions following his second trial were nevertheless reversed because the
prosecutor improperly referred to the defendant’s post-arrest, post-Miranda silence in violation of Doyle,
426 US at 618-619. Clary, 494 Mich at 263.
Page 3-130 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.14
Similarly, “it [is] not ‘error to require th e
defendant, . . . offering himself as a witness upon the second
trial, to disclose that he had not testified as a witness in hi s
own behalf upon the first trial.’” Clary, 494 Mich at 266, quoting
Raffel, 271 US at 499 (alteration added) (noting that th e
defendant’s cross-examination must be relevant and within th e
scope of cross-examination rules). At the defendant’s first trial
in Clary, 494 Mich at 263, the complainant testified that the
defendant shot him, and the defendant did not testify. The firs t
trial resulted in a mistrial due to a hung jury. Id. At th e
defendant’s second trial, the complainant again testified tha t
the defendant shot him, and the defendant took the stand an d
testified that he did not shoot the complainant. Id. at 263-264.
The prosecutor impeached the defendant by asking him wh y
he had not provided that testimony at the first trial. Id. at 264 .
The Michigan Supreme Court held that where a “defendant’ s
silence [is] clearly used for impeachment purposes . . . it i s
admissible under Raffel.” Clary, 494 Mich at 270-271. However ,
the Court cautioned that just because the impeachment i s
constitutionally sound, does not mean that it is automaticall y
admissible under the Michigan Rules of Evidence. Id. at n 8 .
Rather, “the admission of a defendant’s prior silence, as wit h
any other piece of evidence, must comply with the rules o f
evidence, including MRE 401 (defining relevant evidence),
MRE 402 (providing that relevant evidence is generall y
admissible), and MRE 403 (providing that relevant evidenc e
may be excluded if its probative value is substantiall y
outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice).” Clary, 494 Mic h
at 271 n 8.
A defendant is required to testify to preserve for review a
challenge to the trial court’s ruling in limine allowing th e
prosecution to admit evidence of the defendant’s exercise o f
the Miranda right to remain silent. Boyd, 470 Mich at 365.
“Whether [a] defendant was improperly impeached with hi s
silence is a question of law that [appellate courts] review d e
novo.” Clary, 494 Mich at 264.
Prearrest silence. “The issue of prearrest silence is one o f
relevance,” and a “defendant’s failure to respond to a n
accusation is not probative evidence of the truth of th e
accusation.” People v Hackett, 460 Mich 202, 214-215 (1999) .
Tacit admissions are inadmissible “because the inference o f
relevancy rests solely on the defendant’s failure to deny.” Id. a t
213 (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, “ a
defendant’s prearrest silence is admissible for impeachmen t
purposes.” Id.

3.15 Lay Testimony
A. Admissibility
MRE 701 limits lay opinion testimony to certain circumstances:
“If a witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony i n
the form of an opinion is limited to one that is: (a)
rationally based on the witness’s perception; and (b)
helpful to clearly understanding the witness’s testimony
or to determining a fact in issue.” MRE 701.
Testimony by police detectives “about the behavior patterns of
crime victims” was properly admitted under MRE 701 because th e
detectives’ “opinions were based on their observations and
training.” People v Allen, 331 Mich App 587, 607, 609 (2020), vacate d
106
in part on other grounds 507 Mich 856 (2021). “Review of th e
record establishe[d] that their testimony was rationally based o n
their perceptions of victims of trauma and was presumably helpful
to provide the jury with a clear understanding of the victim’ s
conduct.” Allen, 331 Mich App at 609 (also, the “testimony was not a
‘technical or scientific’ analysis” and the detectives’ “understanding
of trauma and crime victims was acquired through training and
experience”).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the
witness’s testimony regarding the opinion she noted in her claim s
log about the plaintiff’s injury as lay opinion testimony under MRE
701 where the witness “testified that she had significant experience
in reviewing medical documentation for defendant [insurance
company], she had approved payment of approximately 100
automobile-accident claims, and she had approved payment of
those claims after determining that the insured had suffered a
serious impairment of body function.” Andreson v Progressive
107
Marathon Ins Co, 322 Mich App 76, 89 (2017). “Because [the
witness’s] testimony was based on her review of medical records i n
the ordinary course of her employment, the opinion expressed i n
her claims log was rationally based on her perceptions, and it wa s
helpful to a clear understanding of her trial testimony and to the
determination whether [the plaintiff] suffered a serious impairmen t
of body function.” Id. at 90. Moreover, the admissibility of th e
witness’s “claims-log entry, wherein she expressed the opinion tha t
105See Chapter 4 for information on expert testimony.
106For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
107The witness was an insurance adjuster employed by the defendant. Andreson, 322 Mich App at 87.
Page 3-132 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 3.15
[the plaintiff] had suffered a serious impairment of body function,
was not rendered inadmissible simply because the jury may have
believed [the witness’s] initial evaluation of the seriousness and
extent of [the plaintiff’s] injuries.” Id. at 91 (rejecting the defendant’ s
argument that the witness’s “testimony was inadmissible because
the existence of a threshold injury is a legal conclusion, and witnes s
testimony regarding a legal conclusion is improper”).
108
B. Distinction Between Lay and Expert Testimony
The Michigan Court of Appeals noted the difference betwee n
testimony by a lay witness and an expert witness in Richardson v
Ryder Truck Rental, Inc, 213 Mich App 447, 455 (1995) (citations
omitted):
“Lay witness testimony in the form of an opinion i s
permitted where it is rationally based on the witness ’
perception and helpful to a clear understanding of th e
witness’ testimony or the determination of a fact a t
issue. An expert witness is one who has been qualifie d
by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or educatio n
and is used where scientific, technical, or othe r
specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact t o
understand evidence or determine a fact at issue.”
C. Physical Observation
“Any witness is qualified to testify as to his or her physical
observations and opinions formed as a result of them.” Lamson v
Martin (After Remand), 216 Mich App 452, 459 (1996).
Admission of a sexual assault nurse’s testimony that the victim wa s
“shielding herself” and “had her arms huddled around herself”
while the nurse conducted a physical examination of the victim did
not constitute plain error affecting defendant’s substantial rights.
People v Brown, 326 Mich App 185, 197 (2019). Defendant challenged
the testimony arguing it “improperly enhanced the victim’ s
credibility by indicating that, even though there was no evidence of
trauma, the victim’s body language implied that the sexual assault s
occurred.” Id. The nurse’s “testimony was admissible lay testimon y
under MRE 701, rather than as expert testimony,” because
“testimony regarding the victim’s body language was not based o n
[the nurse’s] specialized knowledge but on her ‘perception of the
witness.’” Brown, 326 Mich App at 197.
108See Chapter 4 for information on expert testimony.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-133
Section 3.15 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
D. Property
A lay witness may testify as to his or her opinion of the monetary
value of his or her real property, Grand Rapids v H R Terryberry Co,
122 Mich App 750, 753-754 (1983), or personal property, People v
Watts, 133 Mich App 80, 83-84 (1984). Also see MRE 1101(b)(8)
regarding the admissibility of hearsay concerning proof of propert y
value at a preliminary examination.
For purposes of MRE 1101(b)(8), “ownership” of property include s
the right to convey or sell that property. People v Caban, 275 Mic h
App 419, 422 (2007). In Caban, an out-of-court statement made by a
nonexpert regarding a defendant’s right to convey a piece of
property was admissible at a defendant’s preliminary examinatio n
for a crime related to the defendant’s authority to sell the property.
Id. MRE 1101(b)(8) also authorizes hearsay to be admitted at a
preliminary examination in a criminal case “to prove the ownership,
value, or possession of — or right to use or enter — property.”

4.1 Expert Testimony
A. Admissibility
1. Authority
“A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education may testify in the form of a n
opinion or otherwise if the proponent demonstrates to th e
court that it is more likely than not that:
(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other
specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact t o
understand the evidence or to determine a fact i n
issue;
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts o r
data;
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable
principles and methods; and
(d) the expert’s opinion reflects a reliabl e
application of the principles and methods to the
facts of the case.” MRE 702.
“In contrast to MCL 600.2169 [applicable to expert testimony in
2
a medical malpractice action ], . . . nothing in MRE 702
requires that a medical expert be board certified in a particula r
specialty, . . . or that a medical expert have devoted a majority
of his or her practice to a given specialty to be qualified to offe r
expert testimony.” People v McKewen, 326 Mich App 342, 35 0
(2018) (holding the trial court did not abuse its discretion i n
determining that a board-certified cardiothoracic and genera l
trauma surgeon who treated the victim was qualified to testif y
that the victim had been stabbed by a knife despite defendant’ s
objection that the witness was not qualified “because he did
not possess the same qualifications as, for example, a medica l
examiner”). “To require some form of certification in a specifi c
subfield of a larger profession in order to serve as an exper t
witness would cause not only absurd results, but mandate th e

creation of new certifications any time a novel or rare issu e
were before a trial court.” People v Brown, 326 Mich App 185,
196-197 (2019) (a certified nurse who had not yet received he r
sexual assault nurse examiner certification was still considered
competent as a medical professional).
“Expert testimony related to the death of or injury to a
person . . . is governed by MCL 600.2955.” People v Jones, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (“This statute applies to crimina l
proceedings, as well as civil cases.”). “MCL 600.2955 presents a
nonexhaustive list of seven factors that a trial court shall
consider when it determines whether an expert’s opinions ar e
reliable.” Danhoff v Fahim, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024). “[T]hos e
seven factors are:
(a) Whether the opinion and its basis have been
subjected to scientific testing and replication.
(b) Whether the opinion and its basis have bee n
subjected to peer review publication.
(c) The existence and maintenance of generally
accepted standards governing the application and
interpretation of a methodology or technique and
whether the opinion and its basis are consisten t
with those standards.
(d) The known or potential error rate of th e
opinion and its basis.
(e) The degree to which the opinion and its basis
are generally accepted within the relevant exper t
community. As used in this subdivision, ‘relevan t
expert community’ means individuals who are
knowledgeable in the field of study and are
gainfully employed applying that knowledge o n
the free market.
(f) Whether the basis for the opinion is reliable and
whether experts in that field would rely on the
same basis to reach the type of opinion being
proffered.
(g) Whether the opinion or methodology is relie d
upon by experts outside of the context of
litigation.” [Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___, quoting MCL
600.2955(1).]
MCL 600.2955(1) only requires the court to consider the seve n
factors enumerated there; it does not require each factor t o
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-3
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
favor the proffered testimony in order to be admissible. Chapin
v A & L Parts, Inc, 274 Mich App 122, 137 (2007). In addition,
“all the factors in MCL 600.2955 may not be relevant in every
case.” Elher v Misra, 499 Mich 11, 26 (2016) (holding that “th e
scientific testing and replication factor [in MCL 600.2955(1)(a)
did] not fit the type of [standard-of-care] opinion at issue i n
[the] case,” and that although “the circuit court abused it s
discretion by relying on this factor, . . . this [did] not render th e
circuit court’s ultimate decision [to exclude an expert’s opinio n
testimony] an abuse of discretion” where the other argument s
for admitting the testimony did not sufficiently establish th e
expert’s reliability).
“‘A novel methodology or form of scientific evidence may b e
admitted into evidence only if its proponent establishes that i t
has achieved general scientific acceptance among impartial
and disinterested experts in the field.’” Jones, ___ Mich App a t
___, quoting MCL 600.2955(2).
“In an action alleging medical malpractice, the provisions o f
[MCL 600.2955] are in addition to, and do not otherwise affect ,
the criteria for expert testimony provided in [MCL 600.2169].”
MCL 600.2955(3).
2. Trial Court’s Gatekeeper Role
“‘A court considering whether to admit expert testimony unde r
MRE 702 acts as a gatekeeper and has a fundamental duty t o
ensure that the proffered expert testimony is both relevant and
reliable.’” People v Jones, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025), quoting
People v Kowalski, 492 Mich 106, 120 (2012). “‘Because there ar e
many different kinds of experts and expertise, this inquiry is,
by necessity, a flexible one, and a court determining th e
admissibility of expert testimony may consider reliabilit y
factors pertinent to the particular type of expert testimon y
offered and its connection to the particular facts of the case. ”
Kowalski, ___ Mich at 120. “‘Whatever the pertinent factors ma y
be, however, a court evaluating proposed expert testimon y
must ensure that the testimony (1) will assist the trier of fact t o
understand a fact in issue, (2) is provided by an exper t
qualified in the relevant field of knowledge, and (3) is based o n
reliable data, principles, and methodologies that are applied
reliably to the facts of the case.’” Id..
To effectuate its gatekeeper role, a court must focus its inquir y
“solely on principles and methodology, not the conclusion s
that they generate.” Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharm, Inc, 509 US
579, 595 (1993). The Daubert test “requires the trial judge t o
Page 4-4 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
make a preliminary assessment of whether the proposed
expert’s testimony is scientifically valid and whether th e
reasoning and methodology upon which the expert bases thei r
testimony can be applied to the facts in the case.” Danhoff v
Fahim, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (citation omitted). “Thi s
preliminary assessment is known as the trial court’ s
gatekeeping function.” Id. at ___ (noting that “the gatekeeping
function performed by trial courts applies to all exper t
testimony, rather than to only a limited subset of scientifi c
expert testimony”). “Although the Daubert gatekeepin g
function applies to all experts, the list of factors in Daubert i s
flexible and nonexhaustive: Daubert’s list of specific factor s
neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or i n
every case.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). “The specific inquiry is flexible based on th e
circumstances of each case but may include a determinatio n
that the expert’s theory or the techniques used to generate tha t
theory—but not the expert’s conclusions—can be tested, ha s
been subjected to peer review and publication, has a known o r
potential error rate, or is generally accepted among th e
scientific community.” Id. at ___. “In other words, before exper t
testimony may be admitted at trial, the plaintiff must prov e
that the expert’s testimony is relevant and reliable.” Id. at ___.
“The evolution of the federal expert witness doctrine i s
important for understanding Michigan’s approach.” Id. at ___.
Effective January 1, 2004, Michigan adopted the Daubert test b y
amending MRE 702. See Gilbert v DaimlerChrysler Corp, 47 0
Mich 749, 781-782 (2004), which states:
“MRE 702 has . . . been amended explicitly t o
incorporate Daubert’s standards of reliability. Bu t
this modification of MRE 702 changes only th e
factors that a court may consider in determining
whether expert opinion evidence is admissible. I t
has not altered the court’s fundamental duty of
ensuring that all expert opinion testimony—
regardless of whether the testimony is based o n
‘novel’ science—is reliable.
* * *
“[T]he court’s gatekeeper role is the same under
[3]
Davis-Frye and Daubert. Regardless of which tes t
the court applies, the court may admit evidence
3 The Davis-Frye test was derived from People v Davis, 343 Mich 348 (1955), and Frye v United States, 5 4
App DC 46 (1923).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-5
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
only once it ensures, pursuant to MRE 702, tha t
expert testimony meets that rule’s standard of
reliability. In other words, both tests require court s
to exclude junk science; Daubert simply allow s
courts to consider more than just ‘general
acceptance’ in determining whether exper t
testimony must be excluded.”
See also MCL 600.2955, which codifies the Daubert test “[i]n a n
action for the death of a person or for injury to a person o r
property[.]”“MRE 702 ‘requires trial judges to act a s
gatekeepers who must exclude unreliable expert testimony.’ ”
Lenawee Co v Wagley, 301 Mich App 134, 162 (2013), quoting
Staff Comment to 2004 Amendment of MRE 702. “The purpose
of a Daubert hearing is to filter out unreliable expert evidence. ”
Lenawee Co, 301 Mich App at 162. See also Elher, 499 Mich at 2 4
(noting that while the plaintiff’s expert “was qualified to testif y
as an expert based on his extensive experience,” the questio n
was whether the expert’s opinion “was sufficiently reliable under
the principles articulated in MRE 702 and . . . MCL 600.2955)
(emphasis added). Indeed, “[u]nder MRE 702, it is generally
not sufficient to simply point to an expert’s experience and
background to argue that the expert’s opinion is reliable and,
therefore, admissible.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ n 11 (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted).
Expert testimony based on non-scientific knowledge. “While
Daubert hearings are required when dealing with exper t
scientific opinions in an effort to ensure the reliability of the
foundation for the opinion, where non-scientific exper t
testimony is involved, the Daubert factors may be pertinent, or
the relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal
knowledge or experience.” Lenawee Co, 301 Mich App at 163
(alteration, quotation marks and citations omitted). In Lenawee
Co, 301 Mich App at 163, a realtor’s videotaped depositio n
testimony concerning the marketability of the defendants ’
property was played at trial over the plaintiff’s objections and
requests for a Daubert hearing. However, because the realtor’ s
testimony was not “scientific” expert testimony, and instea d
constituted “other specialized knowledge,” the trial court di d
not abuse its discretion in declining to conduct a Daubert
hearing before admitting the testimony. Lenawee Co, 301 Mic h
App at 163-164. “[T]he Daubert factors may or may not b e
relevant in assessing reliability, depending on the nature of th e
issue, the expert’s expertise, and the subject of the expert’ s
testimony. Elher, 499 Mich at 24-25. “[I]n some cases, th e
relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal
knowledge or experience”; however, the Daubert factors ma y
Page 4-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
be helpful in determining reliability even if all the factors d o
not necessarily apply. Elher, 499 Mich at 25 (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). How to determine reliability is withi n
the trial court’s discretion. Id.
3. Application
“MRE 702 does not require that an expert be certified by the
state in the particular area in which the expert is qualified.
Rather, an expert may be qualified on the basis of ‘knowledge,
skill, experience, training, or education[.]’” People v Brown, 32 6
Mich App 185, 196 (2019), quoting MRE 702. In Brown, the trial
court properly qualified a certified nurse as an expert witnes s
in a first-degree criminal sexual conduct trial even though sh e
had not yet received her state certification as a sexual assaul t
nurse examiner. Brown, 326 Mich App at 196. “[The nurse’s]
testimony regarding the lack of injury in most sexual assaul t
cases . . . was properly admitted because it was based on [her ]
specialized knowledge and assisted the jury in understandin g
the evidence in [the] case.” Id. at 197.
“Where it is possible to draw a medical diagnosis based on a
physical examination, as opposed to a complainant’s self-
reporting, an expert is fully permitted to testify that, in thei r
opinion, a particular injury was not accidentally self-inflicted.”
People v Alexander, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up).
In Alexander, the prosecution’s expert witness “testified that her
education, training, and experience provided her wit h
knowledge concerning how to evaluate children, how t o
perform medical exams, how to identify injuries, how t o
diagnose, how to teach, how to conduct research all related t o
child abuse and neglect.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks omitted) .
The expert “further testified that prior to performing he r
evaluations of [the minor child], she examined the mino r
child’s medical records, which included a number o f
photographs of [the minor child’s] injuries and the results o f
[the minor child’s] x-ray report, in addition to informatio n
provided by the forensic interviewer.” Id. at ___.Th e
prosecution’s expert witness “did not suggest that defendan t
acted knowingly or intentionally when she testified that th e
children were diagnosed with medical torture or addressed
any element of the crime charged.” Id. at ___. “While [th e
expert witness] opined that [the minor child’s] injurie s
indicated that the minor child was exposed to at least tw o
distinct physical assaults and at least two psychological
maltreatments, warranting a diagnosis of ‘medical torture,’ sh e
[explained that] her diagnosis was a consequence of her revie w
of the medical records admitted in evidence, which include d
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-7
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
photographs of the ligature marks on [the minor child’s ]
extremities and an x-ray of the minor child’s ankles.” Id. at ___
(holding that “the contested terminology did not have the
potential to conflate the expert’s medical diagnosis with any
legal conclusion concerning defendant’s legal responsibility”).
“Thus, even without the employment of terminology ‘medical
torture,’ [the expert witness] could have properly testified
about the extent of [the minor child’s] injuries, th e
nonaccidental nature of the minor child’s injuries, his repeated
exposure to physical assault and psychological harm, and th e
nature of [the minor child’s] statements during hi s
examination.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, “even if the trial cour t
plainly erred by allowing [the expert witness] to use the label
‘medical torture,’ it [was] unlikely that the error affected th e
outcome of the trial considering the evidence presented.” Id. a t
___ (noting that the trial court properly instructed the jury tha t
it could consider the expert’s testimony as to why she reache d
her conclusions but not as evidence that the events actuall y
occurred).
An expert witness’s failure to identify any medical or scientifi c
literature in support of his or her testimony does no t
necessarily suggest that the expert’s opinion is unreliable o r
inadmissible. People v Unger, 278 Mich App 210, 220 (2008). In
Unger, the Court noted, “it is obvious that not every particular
factual circumstance can be the subject of peer-reviewed
writing. There are necessarily novel cases that raise uniqu e
facts and have not been previously discussed in the body o f
medical texts and journals.” Id. However, “a lack of supportin g
literature is an important factor in determining th e
admissibility of expert witness testimony.” Edry v Adelman, 48 6
Mich 634, 640 (2010) (holding that “peer-reviewed, publishe d
literature is not always a necessary or sufficient method o f
meeting the requirements of MRE 702”). In Edry, the plaintiff’ s
expert witness’s opinion was not based on reliable principles o r
methods, was contradicted by both the defendant’s exper t
witness and published literature that was admitted and
acknowledged as authoritative by the plaintiff’s expert, and th e
plaintiff failed to admit any literature that supported he r
expert’s testimony. Id. at 640. The Michigan Supreme Cour t
concluded that “the lack of supporting literature, combine d

opinion, render[ed] his opinion unreliable and inadmissibl e
under MRE 702.” Edry, 486 Mich at 641.
“Neither MRE 702 nor MCL 600.2955 requires a trial court t o
exclude the testimony of a plaintiff’s expert on the basis of th e
plaintiff’s failure to support their expert’s claims wit h

published literature.” Danhoff v Fahim, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024)
(“Although published literature may be an important factor i n
determining reliability, it is not a dispositive factor . . . .”). I n
Danhoff, the plaintiff’s expert “opined that because a bowel
perforation like plaintiff experienced is so rare and so likely t o
have been caused by a medical instrument in an area it shoul d
not have been that it constitutes a breach of the standard o f
care.” Id. at ___. “The trial court determined that [plaintiff’ s
expert’s] opinion was unreliable almost exclusively because h e
did not cite supportive literature without considering whethe r
(1) [plaintiff’s expert] could have produced such supportiv e
literature, (2) defendant produced any literature or othe r
evidence to contradict [plaintiff’s expert’s] opinion, and (3 )
[plaintiff’s expert’s] opinion was otherwise sufficiently reliabl e
under the factors provided by statute and MRE 702.” Danhoff,
___ Mich at ___.
The Danhoff Court held that “scientific literature is not alway s
required to support an expert’s standard-of-care opinion, bu t
that scientific literature is one of the factors that a trial cour t
should consider when determining whether the opinion i s
reliable.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (stating that “peer-reviewed,
published literature is not always a necessary or sufficien t
method of meeting the requirements of MRE 702, thu s
establishing reliability”) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “[A]n expert in a medical malpractice lawsuit [ma y
be able to] reliably support their opinion on the standard o f
care [even] if the adverse event is so rare that published, peer-
reviewed medical literature on the subject may not exist.” Id. a t
___. “[E]ach case will present unique circumstances for a tria l
court to determine whether the expert’s opinion is reliable.” Id.
at ___. “In some cases, a lack of supportive literature may b e
fatal to a plaintiff’s expert’s reliability.” Id. at ___. “In others, a
plaintiff’s expert may demonstrate reliability withou t
supportive literature, especially where a complication is rar e
and there is a dearth of supportive literature available t o
support the opinion.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the guidepos t
for admissibility is reliability, and trial courts must conside r
MRE 702 as well as the statutory reliability factors presented in
MCL 600.2955 when determining if an expert is reliable”).
“Treating a lack of supportive medical literature as dispositiv e
that the expert’s opinions are unreliable and, therefore,
inadmissible, creates a conundrum.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___.
“If the failure to produce medical literature means that a
plaintiff’s otherwise reliable expert opinions are inadmissible,
patients who experience complications so rare that they are no t
studied by the academic community or discussed in peer-
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-9
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
reviewed publications would not be able to offer admissibl e
expert testimony when seeking legal recourse for thei r
injuries.” Id. at ___. “The avoidance of such a result is why
MCL 600.2955 has several factors and does not merely specif y
that reliability is a product of peer-reviewed medica l
literature.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (“It is also why we have
consistently noted that peer-reviewed medical literature is no t
always necessary or sufficient to meet reliabilit y
requirements.”) (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Ultimately, in Danhoff, the Michigan Supreme Court held tha t
“[t]he lower courts erred by concluding that [plaintiff’ s
expert’s] opinions were unreliable because they wer e
unsupported by medical literature.” Id. at ___ (“The trial cour t
abused its discretion by inadequately assessing [plaintiff’ s
expert’s] reliability as a standard-of-care expert withou t
appropriately analyzing MRE 702 or the statutory reliability
factors of MCL 600.2955.”).
“Careful vetting of all aspects of expert testimony is especiall y
important when an expert provides testimony abou t
causation.” Infinity Physical Therapy, LLC v Meemic Ins Co, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “MRE 702 does not limit medical expertise strictly t o
medical doctors and, under the Public Health Code, th e
making of a limited diagnosis is within a chiropractor’s scop e
of practice.” Infinity Physical Therapy, ___ Mich App at ___ (“A
chiropractor is generally qualified to testify about matter s
within the scope of his profession and practice.”). “Specifically,
a chiropractor can evaluate a patient and make a diagnosis of a
condition or disorder ‘of the human musculoskeletal and
nervous systems as they relate to subluxations, misalignments,
and joint dysfunctions.’” Infinity Physical Therapy, ___ Mich
App at ___, quoting MCL 333.16401(1)(e)(i). “Within thi s
authorization to evaluate and diagnose a patient for certai n
physical maladies, a chiropractor can develop an opinion o f
the underlying cause of the problem.” Infinity Physical Therapy,
___ Mich App at ___ (“[A] chiropractor’s diagnosis can be use d
to detect and correct the listed conditions and recommend
patients seek treatment from other health professionals.”).
In Infinity Physical Therapy, “the trial court abused its discretion
with its broad limitation of [a chiropractor’s] testimony.” Id. a t
___. Although “[t]he trial court properly determined that [ a
chiropractor] could not offer expert opinion about a diagnosi s
made by a physician,” the Court of Appeals held that “it i s
proper for a chiropractor, with the proper foundation, to testif y
about a diagnosis within his or her practice as set forth in MCL
333.16401(1)(e)(i).” Infinity Physical Therapy, ___ Mich App a t
Page 4-10 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
___. “Similarly, a chiropractor, with the proper evaluation of a
patient, may testify about the cause of that condition o r
disorder to the extent that such cause can be reliably linked to a
condition or disorder within the scope of MCL
333.16401(1)(e)(i).” Infinity Physical Therapy, ___ Mich App a t
___ (instructing that, “[o]n remand, the trial court may still
conclude that [the chiropractor’s] testimony does not meet th e
standard of MRE 702, but it may not do so for the sole reaso n
that [the chiropractor] would be offering testimony o n
causation as a chiropractor”). “So long as a proper foundation
is laid, and the testimony is limited in scope as required unde r
the Public Health Code, there is no absolute legal bar to a
chiropractor providing expert testimony on causation fo r
purposes of a motor-vehicle collision.” Infinity Physical Therapy,
___ Mich App at ___. “In contrast, the trial court did not err by
prohibiting [a physical therapist] from offering exper t
testimony on causation.” Infinity Physical Therapy, ___ Mic h
App at ___. “The Public Health Code’s provision of practice for
a physical therapist specifies that the “‘[p]ractice of physical
therapy does not include the identification of underlyin g
medical problems or etiologies, establishment of medical
diagnoses, or the prescribing of treatment.’” Infinity Physical
Therapy, ___ Mich App at ___, quoting MCL 333.17801(1)(d)
(alteration in original). Therefore, “the trial court properly
limited [the physical therapist’s] testimony to the services he
provided and the reasons why he provided the treatment. ”
Infinity Physical Therapy, ___ Mich App at ___.
“[D]epending on the particular facts at issue in a matter and
the expert’s specific expertise, a biomechanical engineer ma y
testify, if not making a medical diagnosis, regarding the impac t
of the forces at play and a resulting injury.” People v Hawkins,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023) (“declin[ing] to articulate an y
bright-line rule prohibiting or allowing biomechanical
engineers from providing testimony related to medical
causation”). In Hawkins, defendant retained a biomechanica l
engineer “as an expert witness to counter the prosecution’ s
evidence that the [8-month-old] decedent’s injuries wer e
caused by multiple blows or incidents of trauma.” Id. at ___ .
The parties agreed that the biomechanical engineer “could
testify regarding the general forces at play” and “how a typical
person might be injured therefrom.” Id. at ___. Defendant als o
made it clear that the expert would “not offer a medica l
opinion or diagnosis evaluating the decedent’s cause o f
death[.]” Id. at ___. The Court of Appeals concluded that th e
proposed testimony — that the decedent’s injuries “could hav e
been caused from a single impact or blow” — was within th e
expert’s area of expertise because it was “based on the expert’ s

Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
biomechanical expertise and the forces at play[.]” Id. at ___.
The Hawkins Court determined that the trial court abused it s
discretion by precluding the biomechanical engineer’ s
testimony under MRE 702 because the substance of hi s
testimony was (1) “scientific, technical, and not commo n
knowledge to the average person,” (2) “probative of a fact a t
issue at trial, whether the decedent’s injuries resulted from a
single blow or multiple blows,” and (3) he was “qualified t o
testify about how forces and motion impact the body . . . b y
nature of his knowledge, experience, training, and educatio n
on the subject.” Hawkins, ___ Mich App at ___ (noting “[t]he
facts that [the expert was] not a medical doctor and lack[ed ]
specific medical training and education are weaknesses or gap s
in his testimony to be explored on cross-examination”).
“A court considering whether to admit expert testimony unde r
MRE 702 acts as a gatekeeper and has a fundamental duty t o
ensure that the proffered expert testimony is both relevant and
reliable.” People v Lemons, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “The job of the courts i s
to . . . ensur[e] that expert testimony employs the same level o f
intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert i n
the relevant field.” Lemons, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). In Lemons, the “trial court stepped
beyond its role as gatekeeper of relevant and reliabl e
information” when it excluded the defendant’s biochemical
engineer’s testimony because “biomechanical studies are no t
presently able to replicate the exact number and degree o f
injury to the brain that would occur as a result of Shaken Bab y
Syndrome [SBS].” Lemons, ___ Mich at ___ (observing tha t
defendant’s biomechanical engineer testified that ”there [were ]
‘good reasons,’ grounded in biomechanical science, t o
conclude that shaking is insufficient to produce th e
accelerations necessary to produce injuries typically associated
with SBS without also causing significant injuries to the neck”).
“Biomechanics is the study of forces acting on and generate d
within the body and of the effects of these forces on the tissues,
fluids, or materials used for diagnosis, treatment, or researc h
purposes,” and “SBS is a multidisciplinary diagnosis based o n
the theory that vigorously shaking an infant creates grea t
rotational acceleration and deceleration forces that result in a
constellation of symptoms that may not manifest externally. ”
Id. at __ (cleaned up). ”[T]he SBS hypothesis is inherently
grounded in biomechanical principles.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). However, “just as a
biomechanical engineer may not testify about medical
causation outside of their expertise, the medical community i s
Page 4-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
not the judge of the validity of biomechanical research, nor is i t
the sole relevant expert community with respect to SBS.” Id. a t
___ (“find[ing] the position that biomechanics—the study o f
forces acting on and generated within the human body—i s
divorceable from a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome to b e
untenable”).
“As it relates to reliability, the focus of the MRE 702 inquir y
must be solely on principles and methodology, not on th e
conclusions that they generate.” Lemons, ___ Mich at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “That said, it is no t
enough that the expert’s opinion rests on data viewed a s
legitimate in the context of a particular area of expertise.” Id. a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Instead, th e
proponent must also show that any opinion based on thos e
data expresses conclusions reached through reliable principle s
and methodology.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “The test o f
admissibility is not whether a particular scientific opinion ha s
the best foundation, or even whether the opinion is supported
by the best methodology or unassailable research.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “A court may conclud e
that there is simply too great an analytical gap between th e
data and the opinion proffered.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks
and citation omitted).
“When evaluating the reliability of a scientific theory o r
technique, courts consider certain factors, including but no t
limited to whether the theory has been or can be tested,
whether it has been published and peer-reviewed, its level o f
general acceptance, and its rate of error if known.” Id. at ___
(cleaned up). “In the context of expert evidence, relevance i s
sometimes referred to as ‘fit’: The trial court must ensure th e
expert’s testimony is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case, s o
that it ‘fits’ the dispute and will assist the trier of fact.” Id. at
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “‘Fit’ is not alway s
obvious, and scientific validity for one purpose is no t
necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated purposes.” Id.
at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“In the realm of the biomechanical evidence underlying SBS,
there can never be a perfectly replicated model of a shake n
infant for obvious ethical reasons.” Id. at ___ (stating tha t
“there will always be at least some gap between the data an d
the conclusions reached”). “This cannot and does not prohibi t
a qualified expert from testifying, on the basis of reliabl e
principles and methodologies, about what can be extrapolated
from various imperfect modeling about how an infant’s bod y
reacts to shaking.” Id. at ___. “Any limitations in th e
conclusions that can be drawn from biomechanical studies a s

applied to the facts of this case go to its weight, no t
admissibility.” Id. at ___. “There is nothing inherentl y
problematic about presenting to a jury expert testimony i n
biomechanics.” Id. at ___.
The Lemons Court held that the defendant’s expert witness’ s
“testimony satisfied the requirements of MRE 702” becaus e
“[h]e was a qualified expert in the field of biomechanical
engineering,” “[h]is testimony regarding the biomechanical
mechanism of SBS would assist the trier of fact in ascertainin g
a fact at issue—whether [defendant’s infant daughter] die d
from injuries caused by abusive shaking,” and
“[b]iomechanical engineering is a legitimate field of scientifi c
study and [defendant’s expert’s] testimony was based o n
sufficient facts or data and was the product of reliabl e
principles and methods.” Lemons, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation
marks and citation omitted) (noting that “conclusions an d
methodology are not entirely distinct from one another”).
Furthermore, the expert’s “testimony was not ‘far removed’ o r
missing a connecting link between data, methodology, an d
conclusion. Rather, it was based on studies specificall y
designed to test the effects of abusive shaking on infants,
utilized various models to test the hypotheses, and specificall y
concluded that shaking without serious injury to the nec k
could not produce symptoms associated with SBS.” Id. at ___.
“[I]t would be unreasonable to conclude that the subject o f
scientific testimony must be ‘known’ to a certainty becaus e
arguably, there are no certainties in science.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted) (Therefore, the Lemons
Court held that “although clearly not universally accepted,
[defendant’s expert’s] opinion [was] certainly objective,
rational, and based on sound and trustworthy scientifi c
literature.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).”The opinion “‘fit’ the fact s
in dispute . . . and would assist the trier of fact in determinin g
whether the prosecution could prove beyond a reasonabl e
doubt that [defendant’s daughter’s] cause of death was SBS. ”
Id. at ___ (citation omitted) (holding that “the trial cour t
abused its discretion by misapplying MRE 702 and ordering
that biomechanical evidence was inadmissible”).
The trial court “did not abuse its discretion by concluding tha t
[a medical expert]’s background and experience were no t
sufficient to render his opinion reliable,” and in excluding th e
expert’s testimony under MRE 702, “when [the expert]
admitted that his opinion [that the defendant-physicia n
breached the standard of care] was based on his own beliefs,
there was no evidence that his opinion was generally accepte d
within the relevant expert community, there was no peer-
Page 4-14 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
reviewed medical literature supporting his opinion, plaintif f
failed to provide any other support for [the expert]’s opinion,
and defendants submitted contradictory peer-reviewed
literature.” Elher v Misra, 499 Mich 11, 27-28 (2016) (noting tha t
“[w]hile peer-reviewed, published literature is not alway s
necessary or sufficient to meet the requirements of MRE 702,
the lack of supporting literature, combined with the lack of an y
other form of support, rendered [the expert]’s opinio n
unreliable and inadmissible under MRE 702”).
In People v Dobek, 274 Mich App 58, 92-93 (2007), the defendant
was not allowed to use an expert witness who, throug h
psychological testing and interviewing, planned to testify tha t
the defendant did not demonstrate the typical characteristics o f
a sex offender. The expert witness admitted that psychological
testing “cannot establish with any degree of certainty that a
person is or is not a sex offender.” Id. at 95. The Court of
Appeals compared the danger of admitting evidence of se x
offender profiling to that of admitting the results of a favorabl e
polygraph test. Id. at 97. According to the Court, the expert’ s
testimony “was neither sufficiently scientifically reliable nor
supported by sufficient scientific data,” as required by MRE
702. Dobek, 274 Mich App at 94-95. In addition, “the proffered
evidence would not assist the trier of fact to understand th e
evidence or determine a fact in issue; rather, any arguabl e
probative value attached to the evidence would b e
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice t o
the prosecution, confusion of the issues, or misleading th e
4
jury.” Id. at 95.
“[B]ecause the claim of a false confession is beyond th e
common knowledge of the ordinary person, expert testimon y
about this phenomenon is admissible under MRE 702 when i t
meets the other requirements of MRE 702.” People v Kowalski,
492 Mich 106, 129 (2012) (plurality opinion). See also People v
Warner, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (“Kowalski did not amount to a
categorical ban on all false-confession testimony”). An exper t
“may not comment on the truthfulness of a defendant’ s
confession, vouch for the veracity of a defendant recanting a
confession, or give an opinion as to whether defendant wa s
telling the truth when he made the statements to the police. ”

research and literature about the phenomenon of fals e
confessions. Id. at 111-112, 132. One of the experts als o
proposed to testify about the defendant’s psychological profile.
Id. at 112, 135. The Court of Appeals held that althoug h
testimony about the phenomenon of false confessions was th e
proper subject for an expert witness, the proposed testimony i n
this case was too unreliable to be admitted because the source s
were prone to inaccuracy and had not been subjected t o
scientific peer-review. Id. at 133. However, the trial court erred
by failing to separately consider the proposed testimon y
regarding the defendant’s psychological profile, which wa s
based on data from tests that the expert himself performed o n
the defendant. Id. at 135-136. In addition, the trial court als o
failed to adequately analyze MRE 403 before excluding th e
psychological profile testimony. Kowalski, 492 Mich at 136-137.
The Court of Appeals explained that the testimony “ca n
provide guidance to a fact-finder regarding behavior tha t
would seem counterintuitive to a juror” and therefore it coul d
have probative value even in the absence of the testimon y
about false-confession literature. Id. at 137. The case was
remanded to the trial court to determine the admissibility o f
the evidence under both MRE 702 and MRE 403. Kowalski, 49 2

allowing the prosecution to present expert testimony from a
mechanic that the vehicle’s break line broke during th e
accident and the brakes should have worked prior to th e
accident. People v Carll, 322 Mich App 690, 698, 699 (2018). “An
expert witness may offer an opinion only if he or she ha s
specialized knowledge that will assist the trier of fact t o
understand the evidence,” and “[t]he determinative inquiry i n
qualifying an expert is the nature and extent of knowledge an d
actual experience[.]” Id. at 699-700 (holding that the mechani c
was qualified as an expert where “[h]e had a colleg e
certification in automotive technology, a state certification i n
brakes, 15 years‘ experience inspecting and repairing breaks, ”
worked on brakes weekly, and had repaired hundreds o f
brakes) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Further th e
mechanic’s methodology satisfied the standard of reliabilit y
under MRE 702 where he testified to personally examining th e
vehicle, explained the data necessary to form opinions abou t
the condition of the brake lines, “explained the mechanism o f
hydraulic brakes and the fact that defendant’s truck ha d
separate lines for front and rear breaks, thereby ruling out th e
possibility that a single brake line failure would affect bot h
front and rear brakes,” testified to his experience with rustin g
brakes and brake lines to explain that the broken brake lin e
was not damaged by rust or another natural cause, an d
concluded that the most likely reason for the broken brake lin e
was the crash itself. Carll, 322 Mich App at 701 (concluding tha t
the expert “had sufficient data to form an opinion, based hi s
testimony on reliable principles and methods, and applied
those methods reliably to the facts of the case”).
Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) testimony is not automaticall y
admissible, and the trial court must still make a determinatio n
whether a DRE officer is qualified to offer expert testimony. Se e
People v Bowden, 344 Mich App 171, 175 n 2 (2022) (noting tha t
even if a person’s “certification designates him to be a dru g
recognition ‘expert,’ that label has no bearing on whether h e
may properly testify as an expert for purposes of MRE 702”).
See Section 4.7 for additional information on DRE testimony.
B. Scheduling Testimony
“In a civil action, the court may, in its discretion, craft a procedure
for the presentation of all expert testimony to assist the jurors i n
performing their duties. Such procedures may include, but are no t
limited to:
(1) Scheduling the presentation of the parties’ exper t
witnesses sequentially; or
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-17
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(2) allowing the opposing experts to be present durin g
the other’s testimony and to aid counsel in formulatin g
questions to be asked of the testifying expert on cross-
examination.” MCR 2.513(G).
Committee Tip:
Sequential or near-contemporaneous scheduling
of competing expert witnesses may have its best
usage in domestic or civil bench trials.
7
C. Testifying Via Video Communication Equipment
After a court determines “that expert testimony will assist the trier
of fact and that a witness is qualified to give the expert testimony,”
and if all the parties consent, the court may allow a qualified exper t
witness “to be sworn and testify at trial by video communicatio n
equipment that permits all the individuals appearing or
participating to hear and speak to each other in the court, chambers,
or other suitable place.” MCL 600.2164a(1).
“[T]he use of videoconferencing technology shall not be used i n
bench or jury trials, or any civil proceeding wherein the testimony
of witnesses or presentation of evidence may occur, except in the
discretion of the court after all parties have had notice and
opportunity to be heard on the use of videoconferencing
technology.” MCR 2.408(A)(2).
Similarly, the court must “consider constitutional requirements, i n
addition to the factors contained in MCR 2.407,” “[w]hen
determining whether to utilize videoconferencing technology” i n
criminal proceedings. MCR 6.006(A)(3).
The party wishing to present expert testimony by vide o
communication equipment must file a motion at least seven day s
before the date set for trial, unless good cause is shown to waive tha t
requirement. MCL 600.2164a(2). The party initiating “the use of
video communication equipment . . . shall pay the cost for its use,
unless the court otherwise directs.” MCL 600.2164a(3). “A verbatim
record of the testimony shall be taken in the same manner as for
other testimony.” MCL 600.2164a(1). See also M Crim JI 5.16, whic h
7 See Section 3.5(G) for discussion of the potential implications of a criminal defendant’s right of
confrontation with respect to the use of audio and video technology.
Page 4-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
addresses witness testimony introduced via video rather than in-
person:
“The next witness, [identify witness], will testify b y
videoconferencing technology. You are to judge th e
witness’s testimony by the same standards as any othe r
witness, and you should give the witness’s testimon y
the same consideration you would have given it had th e
witness testified in person. If you cannot hea r
something that is said or if you have any difficult y
observing the witness on the videoconferencing screen,
please raise your hand immediately.”
D. Number of Experts
No more than three experts on the same issue are allowed to testify
on either side unless the court, in exercising its discretion, permit s
more. MCL 600.2164(2). MCL 600.2164(2) is not “applicable t o
witnesses testifying to the established facts, or deductions of
science, nor to any other specific facts, but only to witnesse s
testifying to matters or opinion.” MCL 600.2164(3).
E. Funding the Expert Witness
1. Fees Taxable as Costs
MCL 600.2164(1) states in relevant part:
“No expert witness shall be paid, or receive a s
compensation in any given case for his services a s
such, a sum in excess of the ordinary witness fee s
provided by law, unless the court before who m
such witness is to appear, or has appeared, award s
a larger sum, which sum may be taxed as a part of
the taxable costs in the case.”
“Instead ‘is to appear’ applies to witnesses who could hav e
been called to testify at some point, either by deposition o r
through trial testimony. The phrase ‘is to appear’ does not refe r
to the situation . . . in which a case proceeded to trial an d
verdict but the witness gave neither deposition nor trial
testimony, notwithstanding language in other cases whic h
could be read as authorizing witness fees under suc h
circumstances.” Carlsen Estate v Southwestern Mich Emergenc y
Servs, PC, 338 Mich App 678, 704 (2021).
“MCL 600.2164(1) authorizes a trial court to award exper t
witness fees as an element of taxable costs.” Rickwalt v Richfiel d
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-19
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Lakes Corp, 246 Mich App 450, 466-467 (2001) (the trial cour t
did not abuse its discretion in ordering a lower amount fo r
expert witness fees than requested by the plaintiff because i t
“considered and weighed the reasonableness of plaintiff’ s
request”). See also Nostrant v Chez Ami, Inc, 207 Mich App 334,
336, 342 (1994), where the trial court abused its discretio n
when it completely refused to award expert witness fees to th e
defendant, awarding only ordinary witness fees, afte r
determining that the witness was in fact an expert.
“Under MCL 600.2164(3), an expert must testify as to ‘matter s
of opinion’ and not to ‘established facts’ to be entitled t o
compensation in excess of that for an ordinary witness.” Int’ l
Outdoor, Inc v SS Mitx, LLC, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023). In
Int’l Outdoor, the witness “testified about his investigation o f
the computer devices at issue and informed the court about th e
observations and reports that he made in his investigation, ”
and “[t]he trial court qualified him as an expert in compute r
forensics, and he offered opinion testimony about hi s
observations throughout the hearing.” Id. at ___. Accordingly ,
the trial court had authority to grant the request to tax th e
expert’s fees as a cost. Id. at ___. However, a “trial court may
only tax those fees related to testifying as an expert witness o r
preparing to testify as an expert witness; the court may not ta x
as a cost those fees arising from ‘conferences with counsel fo r
purposes such as educating counsel about expert appraisals,
strategy sessions, and critical assessment of the opposin g
party’s position.’” Id. at ___ (citation omitted). “Additionally,
the trial court may assess the reasonableness of an expert’s fee s
and adjust them accordingly.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the tria l
court erred by allowing the expert’s fees to be taxed for charge s
that “included time and expenses arguably not compensable a s
costs, such as hardware that he purchased as part of hi s
investigation and telephone conversations apparently for th e
purpose of educating counsel.” Id. at ___. “Moreover, th e
record [did] not demonstrate that the trial court evaluated th e
reasonableness of [the expert’s] fees.” Id. at ___ (“vacat[ing] the
trial court’s order to the extent that it taxed costs for [th e
expert’s] fees and remand[ing] to the trial court to permit it t o
assess the requested fees.”)
Contingency fees are prohibited for expert witnesses i n
medical malpractice cases. MCL 600.2169(4).
Even where an expert witness does not testify, the prevailin g
party may still recover expert witness fees for the cost o f
preparing the witness. Peterson v Fertel, 283 Mich App 232, 24 1
(2009). See also Home-Owners Ins Co v Andriacchi, 320 Mich App
52, 73-74 (2017) (holding costs for expert witness fees ar e

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
properly awarded “under MCL 600.2164 where a case i s
dismissed before that expert can testify at trial,” and wher e
“[t]he costs sought by [the plaintiff] in connection with th e
expert’s time [are] necessary for the expert to develop [their ]
opinion regarding the cause of the damages”).
2. Amount to Pay Expert Witness in Criminal Cases
A defendant may qualify for public funds for an expert even i f
they have retained counsel. See People v Ceasor, 507 Mich 884
(2021) (finding “counsel performed deficiently” by failing t o
make such a request and that defendant demonstrate d
prejudice because there was no victim who could provide a n
account, no eyewitnesses, no corroborative physical evidenc e
and no apparent motive to harm, making the expert the case).
Although “focused on sentencing and . . . whether any fundin g
for an expert, irrespective of the amount, should b e
authorized,” a court may still “employ and be guided by” th e
reasonable probability principle initially articulated in Moore v
Kemp, 809 F2d 702, 712 (CA 11, 1987) and adopted by th e
Michigan Supreme Court in People v Kennedy, 502 Mich 206, 227
(2018), when determining the amount to pay an expert in a
criminal case. See People v Williams, 328 Mich App 408, 41 6
(2019). By failing to provide any “substantive analysis t o
explain why it believed that defendant’s requested sum [o f
$42,650] was [highly] excessive” or “explain how it arrived a t
the sum of $2,500” to fund the expert witness, the trial cour t
erred in limiting the expert witness funding. Id. at 417 (th e
matter was remanded for the trial court “to take int o
consideration the principles set forth in Kennedy i n
determining the amount of funds to reimburs e
defendant . . . so as to satisfy constitutional requirements,”
while giving “[s]pecial attention . . . to the Kennedy Court’ s
adoption of the ‘reasonable probability’ standard
articulated . . . in Moore”).
Committee Tip:
A more detailed recitation of the thought
process used when selecting an amount will
better insulate the ruling from reversal than a
limited record.

indigent defendants in criminal cases.

3. Compensable Activity and Evidentiary Hearing
“An expert is not automatically entitled to compensation for al l
services rendered. Conferences with counsel for purposes suc h
as educating counsel about expert appraisals, strateg y
sessions, and critical assessment of the opposing party’ s
position are not regarded as properly compensable as exper t
witness fees. Experts are properly compensated for court tim e
and the time required to prepare for their testimony. I n
addition, the traveling expenses of witnesses may be taxed a s
costs, MCL 600.2405(1); MCL 600.2552(1); MCL 600.2552(5). ”
Carlsen Estate v Southwestern Emergency Servs, PC, 338 Mich
App 678, 707 (2021) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“When the record is insufficient . . . to discern the actual hour s
expended for taxable costs of court time from that attributabl e
to conference and meeting time, which would not necessaril y
be a taxable cost, the remedy is a remand for an evidentiar y
hearing to further distinguish and recalculate those hour s
spent on taxable versus nontaxable costs.” Carlsen Estate, 33 8
Mich App at 707-708 (quotation marks and citation omitted). I n
Carlsen Estate, invoices that stated that the expert had
“discussion[s] with attorneys” were “not sufficient to allow th e
trial court, or [the Court of Appeals], to determine whethe r
these discussions [were] taxable because they were for trial
preparation, or [were] not taxable because they were fo r
educating counsel about expert appraisals, strategy sessions,
and critical assessment of the opposing party’s position.” Id. a t
709 (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“A witness may be compensated for his or her travel expense s
‘in coming to the place of attendance and returning from th e
place of attendance’ for trial, but only as provided under MCL
600.2552(5).” Int’l Outdoor, Inc v SS Mitx, LLC, ___ Mich App
___, ___ (2023). “Under MCL 600.2552(5), the witness may be
reimbursed a ‘per-mile rate’ equal to the rate set by th e
department of management and budget for state employees. ”
Int’l Outdoor, ___ Mich App at ___. “Mileage must be
‘estimated from the residence of the witness, if his or he r
residence is within this state, or from the boundary line of thi s
state that the witness passed in coming into this state, if his o r
her residence is out of this state.’” Id. at ___, quoting MCL
600.2552(1). While “MCL 600.2552 does not limi t
reimbursement to any particular mode of travel,” the tria l
court erred when it allowed the full cost of an expert’s airfare t o
be taxed as a cost “without applying the estimated miles to th e
rate of reimbursement provided under MCL 600.2552(5).” Int’ l
Outdoor, ___ Mich App at ___ (“vacat[ing] the trial court’s orde r
to the extent that it included this expense and remand[ing] t o
Page 4-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
the trial court for amendment of the order to reflect the cost o f
[the expert’s] travel expense calculated under MCL 600.2552.”)
F. Discovery
1. Civil Cases
“Except as exempted by these rules, stipulation, or court order,
a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide t o
the other parties[, among other things,] . . . the anticipated
subject areas of expert testimony.” MCR 2.302(A)(1)(h). Se e
MCR 2.302(A)(4) for a list of cases exempt from this initia l
disclosure.
Experts who are expected to testify at trial must be identified
and “facts known and opinions held by experts, otherwis e
discoverable under the provisions of [MCR 2.302(B)(1)] and
acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, ”
may only be obtained as set out in MCR 2.302(B)(4)(a)-(d).
MCR 2.302(B)(4)(a) addresses interrogatories, depositions, and
discovery by other means:
• Interrogatories may “require another party to identify
each person whom the other party expects to call a s
an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter
about which the expert is expected to testify, and t o
state the substance of the facts and opinions to whic h
the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the
grounds for each opinion.” MCR 2.302(B)(4)(a)(i).
• “A party may take the deposition of a person who m
the other party expects to call as an expert witness a t
trial. The party taking the deposition may notice tha t
the deposition is to be taken for the purpose of
discovery only and that it shall not be admissible a t
trial except for the purpose of impeachment, withou t
the necessity of obtaining a protective order as se t
forth in MCR 2.302(C)(7).” MCR 2.302(B)(4)(a)(ii). Bu t
see MCR 2.302(B)(4)(d), which adds that “[t]h e
deposition may be taken at any time before trial o n
reasonable notice to the opposite party, and may be
offered as evidence at trial as provided in MCR
2.308(A). The court need not adjourn the trial because
of the unavailability of expert witnesses or their
depositions.”
• “On motion, the court may order further discovery by
other means[.]” MCR 2.302(B)(4)(a)(iii).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-23
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“A party may not discover the identity of and facts known o r
opinions held by an expert who has been retained or speciall y
employed by another party in anticipation of litigation o r
preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a
witness at trial, except
(i) as provided in MCR 2.311 [(physical and menta l
examination of an individual)], or
(ii) where an order has been entered on a showin g
of exceptional circumstances under which it i s
impracticable for the party seeking discovery t o
obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by
other means.” MCR 2.302(B)(4)(b).
“Subject to [MCR 2.302(B)(4)], a party may obtain discovery of
documents and tangible things otherwise discoverable under
[MCR 2.302(B)(1)] and prepared in anticipation of litigation o r
for trial by or for another party or another party’ s
representative (including an attorney, consultant, surety,
indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only on a showing that the part y
seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in th e
preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardshi p
to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by othe r
means.” MCR 2.302(B)(3)(a). MCR 2.302(B)(3)(a) “protect s
drafts of any interrogatory answer required under [MCR
2.302(B)(4)(a)(i)], regardless of the form in which the draft i s
recorded,” and “communications between the party’s attorne y
and any expert witness under [MCR 2.302(B)(4)], regardless of
the form of the communications, except to the extent that th e
communications:
(i) relate to compensation for the expert’s study o r
testimony;
(ii) identify facts or data that the party’s attorne y
provided and that the expert considered i n
forming the opinions to be expressed; or
(iii) identify assumptions that the party’s attorne y
provided and that the expert relied on in forming
the opinions to be expressed.” MCR 2.302(B)(4)(e)-
(f).
Unless manifest injustice would result, the court must requir e
that the party seeking discovery of an expert pay the expert a
reasonable fee for time spent in a deposition. MCR
2.302(B)(4)(c)(i). This does not include preparation time. Id. Th e
party seeking discovery may have to pay “a fair portion of th e
fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the [other] party i n
Page 4-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
obtaining facts and opinions from the expert.” MCR
2.302(B)(4)(c)(ii). MCR 2.302(B)(4) “does not require that th e
deposition testimony of the expert be used at trial before th e
trial court may award fees under the rule.” Carlsen Estate v
Southwestern Mich Emergency Servs, PC, 338 Mich App 678, 70 3
(2021) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“MCR 2.302(B)(4) applies to experts who are third parties t o
the litigation; such experts examine the facts from a distance,
offer opinions, and have no financial stake in the outcom e
other than receiving a court-approved witness fee.” Spine
Specialists of Mich, PC v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 317 Mic h
App 497, 503 (2016). Accordingly, “[a]s the sole owner of [th e
plaintiff medical facility] and the physician who treated [ a
patient] on [the plaintiff’s] behalf, [the owner-physician] wa s
obligated to provide deposition testimony” in the plaintiff’ s
action to recover payment for services rendered to the patien t
following a motor vehicle accident, and was therefor e
“ineligible [under MCR 2.302(B)(4)(c)(i)] to charge a fee for hi s
deposition”; “[w]hile a party (or an employee of a party, a s
here) with specialized knowledge may offer an expert opinio n
within his or her field, the court rules do not contemplat e
payment to a party offering an opinion on its own behalf. ”
Spine Specialists, 317 Mich App at 502, 503-504 (noting that th e
owner-physician would “serve as [the plaintiff’s] spokesperso n
at trial, and [had] a vested interest in the outcome of [the ]
case”). Moreover, “[r]equiring payment to a party for the righ t
to take the party’s deposition would unreasonably burden th e
process of trial preparation, constituting manifest injustice ”
within the meaning of MCR 2.302(B)(4)(c). Spine Specialists, 31 7
Mich App at 503, 505. See Section 4.1(E) for discussion of fee s
taxable as costs.
“MCR 2.302(B)(4) applies only to facts known or opinions held
by an expert that were acquired or developed in anticipation o f
litigation—not to any and all information possessed by a n
expert.” Micheli v Mich Auto Ins Placement Facility, 340 Mic h
App 360, 369 (2022) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“MCR 2.302(B)(4) was inapplicable to plaintiff’s request” that a
doctor produce records from a three-year period “showing [th e
doctor’s] earnings for performing medicolegal work and
showing the number of patient examinations [the doctor ]
performed,” because the records were “kept in the ordinar y
course of business,” and were not “acquired or developed i n
anticipation of litigation or trial.” Micheli, 340 Mich App at 371.

Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
2. Criminal Cases
Upon request, a party must provide all other parties with th e
names and addresses of any expert witnesses that may b e
8
called at trial. MCR 6.201(A)(1). Alternatively, the party may
provide the other party with the witness’s name and make th e
witness available for interview. Id. “[T]he witness list may be
amended without leave of the court no later than 28 day s
before trial[.]” Id.
Upon request, a party must provide all other parties with “th e
curriculum vitae of an expert the party may call at trial and
either a report by the expert or a written description of th e
substance of the proposed testimony of the expert, the expert’ s
opinion, and the underlying basis of that opinion[.]” MCR
6.201(A)(3). However, failure to do so does not necessarily
require the court to preclude the expert from testifying. Se e
People v Rose, 289 Mich App 499, 525-526 (2010). In Rose, th e
trial court permitted an expert to testify even though th e
prosecutor failed to comply with the court’s discovery order t o
supply the opposing party with the expert’s curriculum vita e
or summary of his proposed testimony. Id. The Court of
Appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision because the expert’ s
testimony was limited in nature (the expert did not commen t
on the substantive facts in the case), the defendant waited unti l
the day before trial to raise the issue (notice of the expert wa s
given months before trial), and no evidence of prejudice to th e
defendant existed. Id. at 526.
Committee Tip:
A court may choose from a number of remedies.
Explore the possibility of allowing a short delay,
reordering the presentation of the witnesses,
giving an opportunity for counsel to interview
the witness before the witness testifies, or other
measures short of preclusion.
8 MCR 6.201(A) is applicable to felonies and, in limited circumstances, to misdemeanors. See MC R
6.001(A); MCR 6.610(E)(1)-(2). “MCR 6.201(A) only applies in misdemeanor proceedings . . . if a defendant
elects to request discovery pursuant to MCR 6.201(A). If a defendant requests discovery pursuant to MCR
6.201(A) and the prosecuting attorney complies, then the defendant must also comply with MCR
6.201(A).” MCR 6.610(E)(2).

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
G. Factual Basis for Opinion
“An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the
expert has been made aware of or personally observed. The facts or
data must be in evidence — or, in the court’s discretion, be admitted
in evidence later.” MRE 703.
MRE 703 “permits an expert’s opinion only if that opinion is based
exclusively on evidence that has been introduced into evidence i n
some way other than through the expert’s hearsay testimony.” People
v Fackelman, 489 Mich 515, 534 (2011) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). In Fackelman, the testifying experts relied on a repor t
generated by a non-testifying expert who had observed and
diagnosed the defendant shortly after the incident giving rise to the
case. Id. at 518, 521-522. The report contained facts and data, i n
addition to opinion evidence (the defendant’s diagnosis), which wa s
deemed inadmissible under the federal and state constitutions, a s
well as MRE 703. Fackelman, 489 Mich at 535. The Michigan Suprem e
Court concluded that “because the diagnosis wa s
inadmissible, . . . the report should have been redacted before it wa s
admitted into evidence, and the jury should have been instructed
that the proper and limited purpose of the report was to allow the m
to consider the facts and data on which the testifying experts based
their opinions.” Id.
MRE 703 provides that the evidence upon which expert testimony is
based can be admitted either before or after the expert testifies.
Shivers v Covenant Healthcare Sys, 339 Mich App 369, 375 (2021). I n
Shivers, the trial court granted the defendant’s motion in limine t o
preclude a witness’s testimony because the defendant argued i t
would be based on the inadmissible hearsay statements of a doctor.
Id. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that the trial court’ s
decision was premature because the plaintiff stated that she would
call the doctor to testify at trial, so the facts and data upon which the
witness based her opinion would be in evidence. Id.
MRE 703 establishes that the type of evidence that must be admitted
as the basis for an expert’s opinion are those “facts or data that are
particular to that case.” People v Yost, 278 Mich App 341, 390 (2008).
In Yost, the defendant was accused of killing her daughter b y
administering a lethal dose of Imipramine, a medication used t o
control bedwetting and anxiety. Id. at 344-345. The trial cour t
precluded the defendant’s expert witness from testifying about the
pharmacological characteristics of Imipramine (its half-life, pos t
mortem redistribution, the volume of distribution, and the level of
Imipramine that would be considered lethal) because the testimony
was based on an outside source and constituted inadmissible
hearsay. Id. at 388-389. The Court of Appeals reversed this decisio n
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-27
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
and explained that some of the facts or data particular to the Yost
case included the child’s weight, the dosage of Imipramine
prescribed, and the actual level of Imipramine in the child’s blood.
However, the pharmacological characteristics of Imipramine were
“constants in every case involving Imipramine.” Id. at 390. Because
the pharmacological characteristics of Imipramine were no t
particular to the Yost case, “it was not necessary to have the data i n
evidence before [the expert] could utilize them in rendering a n
opinion.” Id. at 390.
Where “the facts and data underlying [an expert’s] testimony were
fundamentally presented in testimony, documents, and
photographs admitted during [a] five-day trial,” the trial court did
not err when it permitted the expert to rely on hearsay to formulate
a diagnosis where no hearsay exception applied. People v Alexander,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (holding that when “no hearsay
exception applied, an expert is allowed to recount and rely o n
hearsay if it was used as a basis to form an opinion”). In Alexander,
the prosecution’s expert witness “testified that prior to performing
her evaluations of [the minor child], she examined the minor child’ s
medical records, which included a number of photographs of [the
minor child’s] injuries and the results of [the minor child’s] x-ray
report, in addition to information provided by the forensi c
interviewer.” Id. at ___. The expert witness also interviewed a
codefendant and the defendant’s minor children. Id. at ___. “While
[the expert witness] opined that [the minor child’s] injurie s
indicated that the minor child was exposed to at least two distinc t
physical assaults and at least two psychological maltreatments,
warranting a diagnosis of ‘medical torture,’ she [explained that] her
diagnosis was a consequence of her review of the medical record s
admitted in evidence, which included photographs of the ligature
marks on [the minor child’s] extremities and an x-ray of the minor
child’s ankles.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the expert witness “wa s
permitted to advance testimony concerning the alleged abuse of [the
minor child] as her opinion was made on the basis of admitted
evidence detailing physical findings and [the minor child’s] medical
history, in addition to the minor child’s statements.” Id. at ___. “It i s
well-settled that an expert witness may rely on hearsay evidence
when the witness formulates an opinion.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted).
H. Cross-Examination
On cross-examination, it is proper to elicit the number of times a n
expert witness has testified in court, or has been involved i n
particular types of cases. Wilson v Stilwill, 411 Mich 587, 599-60 0
(1981). “A pattern of testifying as an expert witness for a particular
category of plaintiffs or defendants may suggest bias. However,
Page 4-28 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
such testimony is only minimally probative of bias and should be
carefully scrutinized by the trial court.” Id. at 601.
Repeated references to expert witnesses as “hired guns” may
require a new trial. See Kern v St. Luke’s Hosp Ass’n of Saginaw, 40 4
Mich 339, 354 (1978) (when defense counsel “continuously raised
the groundless charge, by direct attack and innuendo, that the
‘bought’ testimony of plaintiffs’ out-of-state expert witnesses wa s
collusive and untrue,” it was so prejudicial that it required a new
trial). However, contrast with Wilson, 411 Mich at 605 (an indirec t
statement implying an expert witness was a “professional witness”
did not require new trial where plaintiff’s counsel responded to the
statement in rebuttal argument and the jury was instructed tha t
statements in closing arguments are not evidence); Wolak v Walczak,
125 Mich App 271, 275 (1983) (where there was no “harrassment or
belittlement of plaintiffs’ expert,” the court’s allowance of a single
statement characterizing an expert witness as a “professional
witness” did not require a new trial). See also People v Unger, 278
Mich App 210, 236-237 (2008) (“[t]he prosecution was free to argue
that defense counsel had ‘bought’ [the expert’s] testimony by paying
him a substantial amount of money”; “counsel is always free t o
argue from the evidence presented at trial that an expert witnes s
had a financial motive to testify”).
“To the extent called to an expert witness’s attention on cross-
examination, a statement is admissible for impeachment purpose s
only if:
• the statement is contained in a published treatise,
periodical, or pamphlet;
• the publication is on a subject of history, medicine, or other
science or art; and
• the publication is established as a reliable authority by the
testimony or admission of the witness, by other exper t
testimony, or by judicial notice.” MRE 707.
I. Contested Diagnoses and Terminology
Medical expert testimony invades the province of the jury by citing
accepted medical terminology that may be misconstrued by
laypersons as imparting emotionally-charged or legally conclusory
connotations. People v McFarlane, 325 Mich App 507, 517-527 (2018).
In McFarlane, the Court of Appeals “determined that the trial cour t
plainly erred when it permitted the prosecution’s expert witness, a
child abuse pediatrician, to use the diagnostic terms “’abusive head
trauma’ and ‘definite pediatric child abuse,’ in her trial testimony,
considering the defendant was charged with first-degree child
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-29
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
abuse.” People v Alexander, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). See
McFarlane, 325 Mich App at 523-527. “Ultimately, the contested
diagnoses implicated a level of willfulness and culpability that wa s
solely within the purview of the jury to determine, as the
prosecution’s expert witness expressly connected said diagnoses t o
the defendant’s state of mind.” Alexander, ___ Mich App at ___
(noting that the McFarlane Court clarified that “a physician ma y
properly offer an opinion that, when the medical evidence i s
considered along with the child’s history, the child’s injuries were
inflicted rather than caused by accident or disease because a jury i s
unlikely to be able to assess the medical evidence”) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “However, the McFarlane exper t
witness exceeded those bounds by providing an opinion tha t
essentially implicated the defendant’s intent in perpetrating the
alleged acts of abuse.” Alexander, ___ Mich App at ___, citing
McFarlane, 325 Mich App at 523.
“Where it is possible to draw a medical diagnosis based on a
physical examination, as opposed to a complainant’s self-reporting,
an expert is fully permitted to testify that, in their opinion, a
particular injury was not accidentally self-inflicted.” People v
Alexander, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up). In Alexander,
the prosecution’s expert witness “testified that her education,
training, and experience provided her with knowledge concerning
how to evaluate children, how to perform medical exams, how t o
identify injuries, how to diagnose, how to teach, how to conduc t
research all related to child abuse and neglect.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks omitted). The expert “further testified that prior t o
performing her evaluations of [the minor child], she examined the
minor child’s medical records, which included a number of
photographs of [the minor child’s] injuries and the results of [the
minor child’s] x-ray report, in addition to information provided by
the forensic interviewer.” Id. at ___.” Unlike McFarlane, “[t]he
contested terminology did not have the potential to conflate th e
expert’s medical diagnosis with any legal conclusion concerning
defendant’s legal responsibility.” Id. at ___. The prosecution’s exper t
witness “did not suggest that defendant acted knowingly or
intentionally when she testified that the children were diagnosed
with medical torture or addressed any element of the crime
charged.” Id. at ___. “[T]he term ‘medical torture’ is a medical
diagnosis reserved for only severe cases in which the victim i s
subjected to at least two instances of physical harm and tw o
instances of psychological harm, but does not suggest any amoun t
of intentionality.” Id. at ____. “While [the expert witness] opined
that [the minor child’s] injuries indicated that the minor child wa s
exposed to at least two distinct physical assaults and at least tw o
psychological maltreatments, warranting a diagnosis of ‘medical
torture,’ she [explained that] her diagnosis was a consequence of her
Page 4-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
review of the medical records admitted in evidence, which included
photographs of the ligature marks on [the minor child’s] extremitie s
and an x-ray of the minor child’s ankles.” Id. at ___. “Thus, eve n
without the employment of terminology ‘medical torture,’ [the
expert witness] could have properly testified about the extent of [the
minor child’s] injuries, the nonaccidental nature of the minor child’ s
injuries, his repeated exposure to physical assault and psychological
harm, and the nature of [the minor child’s] statements during hi s
examination.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, “even if the trial court plainl y
erred by allowing [the expert witness] to use the label ‘medical
torture,’ it [was] unlikely that the error affected the outcome of the
trial considering the evidence presented.” Id. at ___ (noting that the
trial court properly instructed the jury that it could consider the
expert’s testimony as to why she reached her conclusions but not a s
evidence that the events actually happened).
J. Opinion on Ultimate Issue
“[T]he function of an expert witness is to supply expert testimony.
This testimony includes opinion evidence, when a proper
foundation is laid, and opinion evidence may embrace ultimate
issues of fact. However, the opinion of an expert may not extend t o
the creation of new legal definitions and standards and to legal
conclusions.” Carson Fischer Potts and Hyman v Hyman, 220 Mic h
App 116, 122 (1996). Further, an expert witness is not permitted t o
tell the jury how to decide the case. People v Drossart, 99 Mich Ap p
66, 79 (1980). “[A] witness is prohibited from opining on the issue of
a party’s negligence or nonnegligence, capacity or noncapacity t o
execute a will or deed, simple versus gross negligence, the criminal
responsibility of an accused, or [the accused’s] guilt or innocence.”
Id. at 79-80. “[W]here a jury is as capable as anyone else of reachin g
a conclusion on certain facts, it is error to permit a witness to give
his own opinion or interpretation of the facts because it invades the
province of the jury.” Id. at 80. “An expert witness also may not give
testimony regarding a question of law, because it is the exclusive
responsibility of the trial court to find and interpret the law.” Carso n
Fischer Potts and Hyman, 220 Mich App at 123.

K. Report
Upon request in a criminal case, a party must provide “either a
report by the expert or a written description of the substance of the
proposed testimony of the expert, the expert’s opinion, and the

underlying basis of that opinion[.]” MCR 6.201(A)(3). This i s

L. Court-Appointed Expert
1. Court-Appointed Expert to Assist Court
“On a party’s motion or on its own, the court may order th e
parties to show cause why expert witnesses should not b e
appointed and may ask the parties to submit nominations. ”
MRE 706(a). While the “court may appoint any expert that th e
parties agree on and any of its own choosing[, it] may onl y
appoint someone who consents to act.” Id. MRE 706 does no t
apply to a request for an appointed expert to consult with and
assist a litigant. In re Yarbrough Minors, 314 Mich App 111, 121 ,
121 n 7 (2016). “The court must inform the expert of th e
expert’s duties.” MRE 706(b). “The court may do so in writing
and have a copy filed with the clerk or may do so orally at a
conference in which the parties have an opportunity t o
participate.” Id. The expert must inform the parties of an y
findings made. MRE 706(b)(1). The expert may be deposed,
called to testify by the court or any party, and may be cross-
examined by any party, including the party that called th e
expert. MRE 706(b)(2)-MRE 706(b)(4).
2. Court-Appointed Expert Indigent Defendants in
Criminal Cases
When considering an indigent criminal defendant’s request fo r
expert assistance, trial courts must apply the due proces s
analysis set forth in Ake v Oklahoma, 470 US 68 (1985). People v
Kennedy, 502 Mich 206, 210, 228 (2018). “When an indigen t
defendant requests funds for an expert witness, they mus t
show something more than a mere possibility of assistanc e
from a requested expert.” People v Warner, ___ Mich ___, __ _
(2024) (cleaned up). “Specifically, a defendant must show th e
trial court that there exists a reasonable probability both that a n
expert would be of assistance to the defense and that denial o f
expert assistance would result in a fundamentally unfair trial. ”
Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Ake instruct s
that due process requires, for example, that when a defendant’ s
sanity will be a significant factor at trial, the State must assur e
10 MCR 6.201(A) is applicable to felonies and, in limited circumstances, to misdemeanors. See MCR
6.001(A); MCR 6.610(E)(1)-(2). “MCR 6.201(A) only applies in misdemeanor proceedings . . . if a defendant
elects to request discovery pursuant to MCR 6.201(A). If a defendant requests discovery pursuant to MCR
6.201(A) and the prosecuting attorney complies, then the defendant must also comply with MCR
6.201(A).” MCR 6.610(E)(2).

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will
conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation,
preparation, and presentation of the defense.” Id. at ___ (cleaned
up). “In addition, the defendant should inform the court why
the particular expert is necessary.” Id. (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “Though the defendant is not expected t o
provide the court with a detailed analysis of the assistance a n
appointed expert might provide, a defendant’s bare assertio n
that an expert would be beneficial cannot, without more,
entitle him or her to an expert.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
However, a “defendant is not required to show that he i s
unable to present his defense without expert assistance.” Id. a t
___.
Ake is the controlling law in this area, and analysis under MCL
775.15 (as frequently occurred previously) is improper because
“MCL 775.15, by its express terms, does not provide for th e
appointment of expert witnesses. It merely provides a mean s
for subpoenaing certain witnesses and for paying their cost o f
attending trial.” Kennedy, 502 Mich at 222. The Kennedy opinio n
overrules People v Jacobsen, 448 Mich 639 (1995) and People v
Tanner, 469 Mich 437 (2003), to the extent those cases did no t
apply Ake and held (or suggested) that MCL 775.15 governs a
request by an indigent defendant for the appointment of a n
expert at government expense. Kennedy, 502 Mich at 225.
“[F]undamental fairness entitles indigent defendants to a n
adequate opportunity to present their claims fairly within th e
adversary system[.] To implement this principle, [the United
States Supreme Court has] focused on identifying the basi c
tools of an adequate defense or appeal, and [has] required tha t
such tools be provided to those defendants who cannot afford
to pay for them.” Ake, 470 US at 77 (quotation marks and
citations omitted; emphasis added). Thus, the Kennedy analysi s
extends to “post judgment motions seeking an expert and
discovery to aid in [an] appeal.” People v Ulp, 504 Mich 964,
964-965 (2019) (the trial court erred in denying the defendant’ s
postjudgment motions when it concluded Kennedy applied
only if “‘defendant made a sufficient showing . . . that denial o f
expert assistance would result in a fundamentally unfai r
trial’”).
“[I]n a trial in which the veracity of a confession is central, it i s
fundamentally unfair when an indigent defendant is deprive d
of an adequate opportunity to present their claims fairly b y
being denied funding to support necessary expert assistanc e
on false confessions.” Warner, ___ Mich at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). In Warner, the defendant signed
an incriminating statement during a series of interrogations i n

Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
which law enforcement officers employed various technique s
to obtain a confession; the defendant was ultimately convicted
of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for sexually assaultin g
11
his stepdaughter. Id. at ___. Before his second trial, the
“defendant moved for funds to retain an expert witness in fals e
confessions.” Id. at ___ (“Because a large part of the
prosecution’s case was based on defendant’s confession,
defendant explained that he needed the expert in fals e
confessions to support his defense.”). “Defendant’s motio n
identified two potential experts [who] could testify about th e
attributes associated with false confessions and interviewe r
bias.” Id. at ___. “Specifically, [one expert] would testify abou t
police interrogation techniques and false confessions, whil e
[the other expert] would perform psychological testing o n
defendant and testify about the psychology of whether th e
attributes of a false confession are present.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks omitted).
The Michigan Supreme Court held that “there was a
reasonable probability that defendant’s proposed expert could
have assisted the jury in understanding whether the condition s
for a false confession were present and, if so, how thos e
conditions affected the interrogations.” Id. at ___. The Court i n
Warner noted that “without [defendant’s] expert, due proces s
was not served, because the veracity of defendant’s confessio n
was a significant factor at trial.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). The Warner Court reasoned that “[t]he
proposed expert would at least have identified circumstance s
and techniques tending to result in false confessions, which th e
jury could have found applicable to defendant’s confession. ”
Id. at ___. The Court observed that the defendant’s “confessio n
was the only corroborating evidence for [his stepdaughter’s ]
allegations and was central to the prosecution’s case.” Id. at ___
(stating that “the elements of a false confession are beyond th e
understanding of the average juror”) (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). Accordingly, “defendant showed a
reasonable probability both that an expert would be o f
assistance to the defense and that denial of expert assistanc e
would result in a fundamentally unfair trial.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted) (“The question is no t
whether the jury could have convicted defendant had his
confession been sufficiently impeached, but rather whether,
viewing the evidence presented at trial as a whole, there is a
sufficient probability that the trial would be rendere d
‘fundamentally unfair.’”). Therefore, the trial court abused it s
11Defendant’s first conviction was vacated on unrelated grounds. People v Warner, unpublished per curiam
opinion of the Court of Appeals, issued March 21, 2019 (Docket No. 340272).

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
discretion when it “denied an indigent defendant th e
opportunity to fund an expert witness whose testimony would
be integral to fundamental issues of the trial.” Id. at __ _
(remanding to trial court to determine whether defendant wa s
indigent when he filed his motion).
“[W]hen a defendant requests an expert to present a n
affirmative defense, a defendant must make the additional
showing of a substantial basis for the defense.” People v Propp,
508 Mich 374, 381 (2021). In Propp, the defendant was charged
with open murder and requested an expert to assist him i n
advancing the defense that the victim’s death was an accident.
Id. at 377. The Michigan Supreme Court held that the Michiga n
Court of Appeals erred by requiring the defendant to show a
substantial basis for the defense because the defense o f
accident was not an affirmative defense; rather, it negated th e
element of intent for the charge of first-degree premeditated
murder, which the prosecutor had the burden to prove. Id. a t
382.
On remand, the Court of Appeals held that “the trial court did
not commit any error entitling defendant to a new trial b y
denying his motion to appoint a defense expert on the subjec t
of erotic asphyxiation” because “no additional exper t
testimony was necessary to explain such a simple concept t o
the jury—i.e., that defendant was claiming that he did no t
intend to kill the victim and that he must have done s o
accidentally while restricting her airflow (at her request )
during a consensual sexual encounter.” People v Propp (On
12
Remand), 340 Mich App 652, 661 (2022). Accordingly, th e
Court of Appeals determined that “it is not reasonabl y
probable that the denial of this expert assistance resulted in a
fundamentally unfair trial.” Id. at 660.
A defendant’s constitutional right to present a defense was no t
violated when the trial court failed to appoint an expert wh o
would aid a legal defense of insanity where “the register o f
actions [did] not indicate that defendant ever filed a motion fo r
expert assistance.” People v Lafey, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024).
“Without such a motion directing the trial court’s attention t o
the matter, defendant necessarily failed to carry his initial
burden of showing the trial court that there exist[ed] a
reasonable probability that an expert [was] constitutionall y
required.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Second, defendant o n

erred to the extent it held that all of the victim’s statements regarding the defendant’s pattern of stalking,
threats, and domestic violence were categorically admissible under MRE 803(3).” People v Propp, ___ Mic h

appeal fail[ed] to submit an offer of proof indicating that a n
expert would have aided an insanity defense.” Id. at ___.Third,
defendant failed “to establish that he was indigent for th e
purposes of a court-appointed expert.” Id. at ___ (noting tha t
defendant represented in his Standard 4 brief that his mothe r
“‘offered to pay for this outside expert’”). “If defendant wa s
not indigent, he would not have been entitled to a court-
appointed expert and this issue would be moot.” Id. at __ _
(“Simply put, defendant has failed to carry his burden o f
establishing entitlement to relief.”).
See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criminal Proceedings
Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 9, for additional information
regarding the appointment of experts for indigent defendant s
in criminal cases. See also MIDC Standards 3 and 5.
3. Court-Appointed Expert in Parental Termination
Proceedings
In a parental termination proceeding, whether there is a
reasonable probability that an expert would assist the defens e
is not the correct standard for determining a respondent’ s
entitlement to expert assistance funding. In re Yarbroug h
Minors, 314 Mich App 111, 114 (2016). “[W]hen considering a
request for expert witness funding” in a parental terminatio n
proceeding, “the proper inquiry weighs the interests at stak e
under the due process framework established in Mathews v
Eldridge, [424 US 319, 335 (1976),]” which “examine[s] th e
private and governmental interests at stake, the extent t o
which the procedures otherwise available to [the parent ]
serve[] their interests, and the burden on the state of providin g
expert funding.” Yarbrough, 314 Mich App at 114, 134, 13 7
(“highlight[ing] the inherently fact-specific inquiry required b y
the Eldridge due process framework”). In Yarbrough, “the
private interests strongly favored funding for an exper t
witness or consultant” where “[t]he science swirling aroun d
cases involving ‘shaken baby syndrome’ and other forms o f
child abuse [was] ‘highly contested,’” and “the nature of th e
child welfare proceedings [did not] adequately safeguard[ ]
respondents’ interests, absent funding for an independen t
expert,” where “only one side possesse[d] the funds necessar y
to pay an expert witness, [and] the opposing side [wa s
required to] rely on cross-examination to attack the expert’ s
testimony.” Yarbrough, 314 Mich App at 135-136 (citatio n
omitted). Further, the burden of providing approximatel y
$2,500 as requested by the respondents did not “outweigh[] th e
interests of [the] indigent [respondents], who otherwise lacked
the financial resources to retain expert medical consultation. ”
Page 4-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.1
Id. at 137 (holding that the trial court abused its discretion b y
failing to conduct a due process analysis under Eldridge and b y
failing to authorize reasonable funding for an exper t
13
witness).
4. Improper Delegation of Duties
It is improper for the court to “delegate its functions of makin g
conclusions of law, reviewing motions, requiring th e
production of evidence, issuing subpoenas, conducting and
regulating miscellaneous proceedings, examining document s
and witnesses, and preparing final findings of fact” to a n
appointed expert witness. Carson Fischer Potts and Hyman, 22 0
Mich App 116, 121 (1996). In Carson Fischer Potts and Hyman,
the trial court appointed an expert to “‘make findings of fact,
conclusions of law and a final recommendation and proposed
judgment’” for the court. Id. at 118. The Michigan Court of
Appeals concluded it was error to “delegate specific judicia l
functions to an ‘expert witness.’ It is within the peculia r
province of the judiciary to adjudicate upon and protect th e
rights and interests of the citizens, and to construe and appl y
the laws.” Id. at 121.
M. Motion to Strike
“A party must move to strike an expert within a reasonable time
after learning the expert’s [sic: identity] and basic qualifications. The
failure to timely do so results in forfeiture of the issue.” Cox v Flint
Bd of Hosp Mgrs (On Remand), 243 Mich App 72, 80 (2000) (citatio n
14
omitted), rev’d on other grounds 467 Mich 1 (2002).
N. Disqualification Based on Conflict of Interest
“Cases granting disqualification are rare because courts are
generally reluctant to disqualify expert witnesses, especially those
who possess useful specialized knowledge.” Teutsch Estate v Van De
Ven, 336 Mich App 604, 609 (2021) (quotation marks, alteration, an d
citation omitted). In evaluating whether to disqualify an exper t
witness on the basis of conflict of interest where “side-switching” i s
not an issue, courts should consider “whether the attorney or clien t
acted reasonably in assuming that a confidential or fiduciary
relationship of some sort existed and, if so, whether the relationship

Institute’s Child Protective Proceedings Benchbook, Chapter 11.
14For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our

Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-37
Section 4.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
developed into a matter sufficiently substantial to make
disqualification or some other judicial remedy appropriate.” Id. at
609-610 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Stating eac h
proposition negatively, if any disclosures of privileged or
confidential material were undertaken without a reasonable
expectation that they would be so maintained . . . , or if, despite the
existence of a relationship conducive to such disclosures, n o
disclosures of any significance were made, it would see m
inappropriate for the court to dictate to the expert.” Id. at 610
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
Several factors may be considered in evaluating the reasonablenes s
of a party’s assumption of a fiduciary relationship, including: “(1)
whether the relationship was long standing and involved frequen t
contacts, (2) whether the expert was to be called as a witness in the
underlying case, (3) whether the parties entered into a formal
confidentiality agreement, (4) whether the expert was retained t o
assist in the litigation or paid a fee, (5) whether work product wa s
discussed or the party provided documents to the expert, and (6)
whether the expert derived any of his specific ideas from work done
under the direction of the retaining party.” Teutsch Estate, 336 Mich
App at 611. “As to the second prong, . . . [c]onfidential information
is information of particular significance or information which ca n
readily be identified as either attorney work product or within the
scope of the attorney-client privilege.” Id. at 612 (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). Courts should also consider public interes t
factors, “such as preventing conflicts of interest, maintaining the
integrity of the judicial process, maintaining accessibility to expert s
with specialized knowledge, . . . encouraging experts to pursu e
their professional calling, . . . [and] whether another expert i s
available and whether the opposing party will be unduly burdened
by having to retain a new expert.” Id. at 613 (quotation marks an d
citation omitted).
O. Rebutting Defendant’s Presentation of Expert Testimony
on Mental State
“When a defendant presents evidence through a psychological
expert who has examined [the defendant], the government likewise
is permitted to use the only effective means of challenging tha t
evidence: testimony from an expert who has also examined him.”
Kansas v Cheever, 571 US 87, 94 (2013). Specifically, “where a defens e
expert who has examined the defendant testifies that the defendan t
lacked the requisite mental state to commit a crime, the prosecutio n
may offer evidence from a court-ordered psychological examinatio n
for the limited purpose of rebutting the defendant’s evidence.” Id. a t
98 (finding the Fifth Amendment did not prohibit the governmen t
from introducing evidence from the defendant’s court-ordered
Page 4-38 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section
mental evaluation to rebut expert testimony that supported a
defense of voluntary intoxication).
“[O]nce [a defendant] places into evidence his own expert’ s
psychological report (that used information obtained fro m
defendant), the Fifth Amendment (or its state counterpart) canno t
then be used as a shield to prevent the prosecution from accessing
similar information from defendant for their own expert’s use[.]”
People v Black, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (Defendant “canno t
have his cake and eat it too[.]”) (quotation marks and citatio n
15
omitted). In a Miller hearing, “when a defendant intends o n
submitting an expert witness and report to the trial court tha t
addresses any relevant Miller factors, neither the Fifth Amendmen t
nor art 1, § 17 of the Michigan Constitution are violated when the
defendant is required by court order to submit to an examination by
a state witness.” Black, ___ Mich App at ___. “[B]ecause th e
prosecutor bears the burden of proof at a Miller hearing, and tha t
burden is to rebut a presumption that the particular juvenile
defendant is not deserving of life without parole, providing the
prosecution the ability to have its expert meet with defendant for
purposes of expert evaluation and testimony to rebut defendant’ s
evidence does not violate his right against self-incrimination.” Id. a t
___ (cleaned up). Indeed, “nothing in the amendment allows a
defendant to submit evidence relevant to his current mental statu s
while at the same time refusing the prosecution access to the same
information and opportunity[.]” Id. at ___.
“Thus, while recognizing that defendant retains his Fift h
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, it remains the case
that the privilege cannot be selectively asserted in an effort t o
control what narrative or information is available to a court and the
prosecutor.” Id. at __ (holding that “the Fifth Amendment is no t
violated (or the right is waived) by requiring defendant to cooperate
with a state expert hired to rebut the evidence defendant i s
submitting on the issue”). “Even as a general rule, in the context o f
testimony and cross-examination, a witness, in a single proceeding,
may not testify voluntarily about a subject and then invoke the
privilege against self-incrimination when questioned about the
details.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Allowing a witness when testifying to pick and choose wha t
aspects of a particular subject to discuss would call into question the
trustworthiness of the statements and limit the integrity of the
factual inquiry.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Any resultant distortion by allowing an individual to completely
control the narrative could make of the Fifth Amendment not only a
humane safeguard against judicially coerced self-disclosure but a

4.2 Criminal Cases Involving Abuse Charges
Medical expert testimony invades the province of the jury by citin g
accepted medical terminology that may be misconstrued by layperson s
as imparting emotionally-charged or legally conclusory connotations.
People v McFarlane, 325 Mich App 507, 517-527 (2018). In McFarlane, th e
Court of Appeals “determined that the trial court plainly erred when i t
permitted the prosecution’s expert witness, a child abuse pediatrician, t o
use the diagnostic terms “’abusive head trauma’ and ‘definite pediatri c
child abuse,’ in her trial testimony, considering the defendant wa s
charged with first-degree child abuse.” People v Alexander, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2024). See McFarlane, 325 Mich App at 523-527. “Ultimately, th e
contested diagnoses implicated a level of willfulness and culpability tha t
was solely within the purview of the jury to determine, as th e
prosecution’s expert witness expressly connected said diagnoses to th e
defendant’s state of mind.” Alexander, ___ Mich App at ___ (noting tha t
the McFarlane Court clarified that “a physician may properly offer a n
opinion that, when the medical evidence is considered along with th e
child’s history, the child’s injuries were inflicted rather than caused b y
accident or disease because a jury is unlikely to be able to assess th e
medical evidence”) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “However,
the McFarlane expert witness exceeded those bounds by providing an
opinion that essentially implicated the defendant’s intent in perpetratin g
the alleged acts of abuse.” Alexander, ___ Mich App at ___, citin g
McFarlane, 325 Mich App at 523.
“[A]ny use of the word ‘abuse’ in the context of a medical diagnosis,
irrespective of whether that is in fact an accepted medical diagnosis,
constitutes plain error in a criminal proceeding involving charges o f
abuse.” People v Ackley (On Remand), 336 Mich App 586, 591-592, 594
(2021). (“medical expert testimony invade[s] the province of the jury b y
referencing accepted medical terminology that might be misunderstood
by laypersons as conveying emotional or legally conclusor y
connotations”). The Ackley Court cautioned that “the bench and bar mus t
be mindful of any impermissible words used by experts, and expert s
should be cautioned that some words may be accepted medical
terminology but are unacceptable in a Michigan courtroom.” Id. at 593-
594. “[E]xperts are permitted to draw and testify regarding conclusion s
Page 4-40 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.2
that encompass a question to be decided by the jury, so long as the exper t
does not purport–or, importantly for this matter, even appear to purport–
to draw a legal conclusion.” Id. at 595. “Thus, where it is possible to draw
a medical diagnosis based on a physical examination, as opposed to a
complainant’s self-reporting, an expert is fully permitted to testify that, i n
their opinion, a particular injury was not accidentally self-inflicted,” bu t
“[t]he expert may not call that manner of injury ‘abuse,’ because, even i f
that is a term used in the medical community, it is also a legal conclusio n
and would be understood by laypersons to connote something differen t
from what another doctor might understand.” Id.
“Where it is possible to draw a medical diagnosis based on a physical
examination, as opposed to a complainant’s self-reporting, an expert i s
fully permitted to testify that, in their opinion, a particular injury was no t
accidentally self-inflicted.”Alexander, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up).
In Alexander, the prosecution’s expert witness “testified that he r
education, training, and experience provided her with knowledg e
concerning how to evaluate children, how to perform medical exams,
how to identify injuries, how to diagnose, how to teach, how to conduc t
research all related to child abuse and neglect.” Id. at ___ (quotation
marks omitted). The expert “further testified that prior to performing her
evaluations of [the minor child], she examined the minor child’s medical
records, which included a number of photographs of [the minor child’s ]
injuries and the results of [the minor child’s] x-ray report, in addition t o
information provided by the forensic interviewer.” Id. at ___. Unlik e
McFarlane, “[t]he contested terminology did not have the potential to
conflate the expert’s medical diagnosis with any legal conclusio n
concerning defendant’s legal responsibility.” Id. at ___.The prosecution’ s
expert witness “did not suggest that defendant acted knowingly o r
intentionally when she testified that the children were diagnosed wit h
medical torture or addressed any element of the crime charged.” Id. at
___. “[T]he term ‘medical torture’ is a medical diagnosis reserved fo r
only severe cases in which the victim is subjected to at least two instance s
of physical harm and two instances of psychological harm, but does no t
suggest any amount of intentionality.” Id. at ____. “While [the exper t
witness] opined that [the minor child’s] injuries indicated that the mino r
child was exposed to at least two distinct physical assaults and at leas t
two psychological maltreatments, warranting a diagnosis of ‘medical
torture,’ she [explained that] her diagnosis was a consequence of he r
review of the medical records admitted in evidence, which included
photographs of the ligature marks on [the minor child’s] extremities and
an x-ray of the minor child’s ankles.” Id. at ___ (holding that “th e
contested terminology did not have the potential to conflate the expert’ s
medical diagnosis with any legal conclusion concerning defendant’s legal
responsibility”).“Thus, even without the employment of terminology
‘medical torture,’ [the expert witness] could have properly testified abou t
the extent of [the minor child’s] injuries, the nonaccidental nature of th e
minor child’s injuries, his repeated exposure to physical assault and
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-41
Section 4.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
psychological harm, and the nature of [the minor child’s] statement s
during his examination.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, “even if the trial cour t
plainly erred by allowing [the expert witness] to use the label ‘medical
torture,’ it [was] unlikely that the error affected the outcome of the trial
considering the evidence presented.” Id. at ___ (noting that the trial cour t
properly instructed the jury that it could consider the expert’s testimon y
as to why she reached her conclusions but not as evidence that the events
actually happened).
“[D]epending on the particular facts at issue in a matter and the expert’ s
specific expertise, a biomechanical engineer may testify, if not making a
medical diagnosis, regarding the impact of the forces at play and a
resulting injury.” People v Hawkins, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023 )
(“declin[ing] to articulate any bright-line rule prohibiting or allowin g
biomechanical engineers from providing testimony related to medical
causation”). In Hawkins, a defendant charged with murder and chil d
abuse retained a biomechanical engineer “as an expert witness to counte r
the prosecution’s evidence that the [8-month-old] decedent’s injurie s
were caused by multiple blows or incidents of trauma.” Id. at ___. Th e
parties agreed that the biomechanical engineer “could testify regardin g
the general forces at play” and “how a typical person might be injured
therefrom.” Id. at ___. Defendant also made it clear that the expert would
“not offer a medical opinion or diagnosis evaluating the decedent’s caus e
of death[.]” Id. at ___. The proposed testimony—that the decedent’s
injuries “could have been caused from a single impact or blow”—wa s
within the expert’s area of expertise because it was “based on the expert’ s
biomechanical expertise and the forces at play[.]” Id. at ___. Accordingly,
the Court of Appeals determined that the trial court abused its discretio n
by precluding the biomechanical engineer’s testimony under MRE 702.
Hawkins, ___ Mich App at ___ (noting “[t]he facts that [the expert was]
not a medical doctor and lack[ed] specific medical training and educatio n
are weaknesses or gaps in his testimony to be explored on cross-
examination”).
“A court considering whether to admit expert testimony under MRE 702
acts as a gatekeeper and has a fundamental duty to ensure that th e
proffered expert testimony is both relevant and reliable.” People v Lemons,
___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “The jo b
of the courts is to . . . ensur[e] that expert testimony employs the sam e
level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in th e
relevant field.” Lemons, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). In Lemons, the “trial court stepped beyond its role as gatekeepe r
of relevant and reliable information” when it excluded the defendant’ s
biochemical engineer’s testimony because “biomechanical studies are no t
presently able to replicate the exact number and degree of injury to th e
brain that would occur as a result of Shaken Baby Syndrome [SBS]. ”
Lemons, ___ Mich at ___ (observing that defendant’s biomechanical
engineer testified that ”there [were] ‘good reasons,’ grounded i n

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.2
biomechanical science, to conclude that shaking is insufficient to produc e
the accelerations necessary to produce injuries typically associated wit h
SBS without also causing significant injuries to the neck”).
“Biomechanics is the study of forces acting on and generated within th e
body and of the effects of these forces on the tissues, fluids, or material s
used for diagnosis, treatment, or research purposes,” and “SBS is a
multidisciplinary diagnosis based on the theory that vigorously shakin g
an infant creates great rotational acceleration and deceleration forces tha t
result in a constellation of symptoms that may not manifest externally. ”
Id. at __ (cleaned up). ”[T]he SBS hypothesis is inherently grounded i n
biomechanical principles.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). However, “just as a biomechanical engineer may not testif y
about medical causation outside of their expertise, the medical
community is not the judge of the validity of biomechanical research, no r
is it the sole relevant expert community with respect to SBS.” Id. at __ _
(“find[ing] the position that biomechanics—the study of forces acting o n
and generated within the human body—is divorceable from a diagnosi s
of shaken baby syndrome to be untenable”).
“As it relates to reliability, the focus of the MRE 702 inquiry must b e
solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that the y
generate.” Lemons, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “That said, it is not enough that the expert’s opinion rests o n
data viewed as legitimate in the context of a particular area of expertise. ”
Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Instead, the proponen t
must also show that any opinion based on those data expresse s
conclusions reached through reliable principles and methodology.” Id. a t
___ (cleaned up). “The test of admissibility is not whether a particula r
scientific opinion has the best foundation, or even whether the opinion i s
supported by the best methodology or unassailable research.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “A court may conclude that ther e
is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinio n
proffered.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“When evaluating the reliability of a scientific theory or technique, court s
consider certain factors, including but not limited to whether the theor y
has been or can be tested, whether it has been published and peer-
reviewed, its level of general acceptance, and its rate of error if known. ”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “In the context of expert evidence, relevance i s
sometimes referred to as ‘fit’: The trial court must ensure the expert’ s
testimony is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case, so that it ‘fits’ th e
dispute and will assist the trier of fact.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “‘Fit’ is not always obvious, and scientific validity fo r
one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated
purposes.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-43
Section 4.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“In the realm of the biomechanical evidence underlying SBS, there ca n
never be a perfectly replicated model of a shaken infant for obvious ethical
reasons.” Id. at ___ (stating that “there will always be at least some ga p
between the data and the conclusions reached”). “This cannot and doe s
not prohibit a qualified expert from testifying, on the basis of reliabl e
principles and methodologies, about what can be extrapolated fro m
various imperfect modeling about how an infant’s body reacts t o
shaking.” Id. at ___. “Any limitations in the conclusions that can be
drawn from biomechanical studies as applied to the facts of this case g o
to its weight, not admissibility.” Id. at ___. “There is nothing inherentl y
problematic about presenting to a jury expert testimony i n
biomechanics.” Id. at ___.
The Lemons Court held that the defendant’s expert witness’s “testimony
satisfied the requirements of MRE 702” because “[h]e was a qualified
expert in the field of biomechanical engineering,” “[h]is testimon y
regarding the biomechanical mechanism of SBS would assist the trier o f
fact in ascertaining a fact at issue—whether [defendant’s infant daughter ]
died from injuries caused by abusive shaking,” and “[b]iomechanical
engineering is a legitimate field of scientific study and [defendant’ s
expert’s] testimony was based on sufficient facts or data and was th e
product of reliable principles and methods.” Lemons, ___ Mich at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted) (noting that “conclusions an d
methodology are not entirely distinct from one another”).
Furthermore, the expert’s “testimony was not ‘far removed’ or missing a
connecting link between data, methodology, and conclusion. Rather, i t
was based on studies specifically designed to test the effects of abusiv e
shaking on infants, utilized various models to test the hypotheses, an d
specifically concluded that shaking without serious injury to the nec k
could not produce symptoms associated with SBS.” Id. at ___. “[I]t would
be unreasonable to conclude that the subject of scientific testimony mus t
be ‘known’ to a certainty because arguably, there are no certainties i n
science.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted) (Therefore, th e
Lemons Court held that “although clearly not universally accepted,
[defendant’s expert’s] opinion [was] certainly objective, rational, and
based on sound and trustworthy scientific literature.” Id. at ___ (cleaned
up).”The opinion “‘fit’ the facts in dispute . . . and would assist the trie r
of fact in determining whether the prosecution could prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that [defendant’s daughter’s] cause of death was SBS. ”
Id. at ___ (citation omitted) (holding that “the trial court abused it s
discretion by misapplying MRE 702 and ordering that biomechanical
evidence was inadmissible”).

4.3 Characteristics of Specific Victim Groups—Expert
Testimony
A. Intimate Partner Violence—Battered Woman Syndrome/
16
Battered Partner Syndrome
“‘Intimate Partner Violence’ has replaced the prior term ‘Battered
Women’s Syndrome.’” People v Skippergosh, ___ Mich App ___, ___ n
9 (2024). “‘[B]attered woman’ refers to a woman who is repeatedl y
subjected to any forceful, physical or psychological behavior by a
man in order to coerce her to do something he wants her to d o
without any concern for her rights, and in order to be classified as a
battered woman, the couple must go through the battering cycle a t
least twice.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). “[E]xper t
testimony regarding intimate-partner violence may be
appropriate . . . to explain when a complainant endures prolonged
toleration of physical abuse and then attempts to hide or minimize
the effect of the abuse, delays reporting the abuse to authorities or
friends, or denies or recants the claim of abuse[.]” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
Expert testimony relating to the characteristics associated wit h
intimate partner violence is admissible when the witness is properly
qualified and the testimony is relevant and helpful to the jury’ s
evaluation of the complainant’s credibility. People v Christel, 44 9
Mich 578, 579-580 (1995). The expert’s testimony is admissible t o
help explain the complainant’s behavior, but the testimony is no t
admissible to express the expert’s opinion of whether the
complainant was a battered woman or to comment on the
complainant’s honesty. Id. at 580 (holding that battered woma n
syndrome was not relevant “because complainant [had] consistently
maintained that the relationship ended . . . and there [was] n o
evidence that complainant hid or minimized, delayed reporting, or
recanted the abuse”).
“Even proposed expert testimony that is offered by a qualified
expert and based on reliable scientific data and methods may be
properly excluded if it is not relevant to the facts of the case or i s
offered for a proposition that does not require the aid of exper t
interpretation.” Skippergosh, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up). I n
Skippergosh, the victim “satisfied the definition of ‘battered
woman.’” Id. at ___. Although the defendant argued that th e
16“Because abusive conduct and victimization are neither gender-specific nor exclusive to married couples,
the broader term ‘battered partner syndrome’ . . . is the most appropriate.” People v Spaulding, 332 Mic h
App 638, 648 n 2 (2020). The cases discussed in this subsection predate Spaulding, and thus, reference
battered woman syndrome.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-45
Section 4.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
prosecution’s intimate partner violence expert “was not familia r
with the facts of the case, such familiarity is not required.” Id. at ___.
“To the contrary, such expert testimony only is admissible to explai n
the generalities or characteristics of the syndrome.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted) (“Therefore, [the expert]
appropriately testified to generalities without opining on the facts of
the case, as is common in many criminal cases requiring behavioral
expert testimony.”).
B. Victims of Child Sexual Abuse
“[W]hen a defendant attacks the credibility of the victim, a qualified
expert may offer testimony to explain the typical behavior of
victims of child sex abuse.” People v Sattler-VanWagoner, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2024). “In child sex abuse cases, an expert may als o
testify regarding the typical symptoms of child sexual abuse i n
order to explain a victim’s specific behavior that might be
incorrectly construed by the jury as inconsistent with that of a n
abuse victim or to rebut a credibility attack.” Id. at ___.
“Commenting on the numerical odds or a statistical assessment of a
witness telling the truth or lying about sexual assault allegation s
amounts to vouching.” Id. at ___.
“‘[C]ourts should be particularly insistent in protecting innocen t
defendants in child sexual abuse cases’ given ‘the concerns of
suggestibility and the prejudicial effect an expert’s testimony may
have on a jury.’” People v Musser, 494 Mich 337, 362-363 (2013)
(holding that a detective who was not qualified as an expert witnes s
was still subject to the same limitations as an expert because he
“‘gave . . . the same aura of superior knowledge that accompanie s
expert witnesses in other trials’” and because, as a police officer,
jurors may have been inclined to place undue weight on hi s
testimony), quoting People v Peterson, 450 Mich 349, 371 (1995),
modified 450 Mich 1212 (1995). Accordingly, an expert witness’ s
testimony is limited. Peterson, 450 Mich at 352. The expert witnes s
may not (1) testify that the sexual abuse occurred, (2) vouch for the
veracity of the victim, or (3) testify to the defendant’s guilt. Id.
Despite these limitations, “(1) an expert may testify in the
prosecution’s case in chief [(rather than only in rebuttal)] regarding
typical and relevant symptoms of child sexual abuse for the sole
purpose of explaining a victim’s specific behavior that might be
incorrectly construed by the jury as inconsistent with that of a n
actual abuse victim, and (2) an expert may testify with regard to the
consistencies between the behavior of the particular victim and
other victims of child sexual abuse to rebut an attack on the victim’ s
credibility.” Peterson, 450 Mich at 352-353.
Page 4-46 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.3
“Unless a defendant raises the issue of the particular child victim’ s
postincident behavior or attacks the child’s credibility, an exper t
may not testify that the particular child victim’s behavior i s
consistent with that of a sexually abused child. Such testimony
would be improper because it comes too close to testifying that the
particular child is a victim of sexual abuse.” Peterson, 450 Mich a t
373-374.
Where the defense theory raised the issue of the complainant’ s
postincident behavior (attempting suicide), it was not an abuse of
discretion to admit expert testimony comparing the child-victim’ s
postincident behavior with that of sexually abused children. People v
Lukity, 460 Mich 484, 500-502 (1999). The Court stated:
“Under Peterson, raising the issue of a complainant’ s
post-incident behavior opens the door to exper t
testimony that the complainant’s behavior wa s
consistent with that of a sexual abuse victim.
Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretio n
in allowing [the expert] to testify.
“Moreover, defendant effectively cross-examined [th e
expert] and convincingly argued in closing that the fac t
that a behavior is ‘consistent’ with the behavior of a
sexual abuse victim is not dispositive evidence tha t
sexual abuse occurred. Specifically, [the defendant ]
argued that ‘almost any behavior is not inconsisten t
with being a victim of sexual assault.’” Lukity, 469 Mich
at 501-502.
In People v Smith, the case consolidated with Peterson, the Michiga n
Supreme Court found that the trial itself was “an almost perfec t
model for the limitations that must be set in allowing exper t
testimony into evidence in child sexual abuse cases.” Peterson, 45 0
Mich at 381. In that case, the victim delayed reporting the abuse for
several years, but the defendant did not ask the victim any
questions suggesting that the delay in reporting was inconsisten t
with the alleged abuse nor did the defendant attack the victim’ s
credibility. Id. at 358. The trial court allowed a single expert t o
clarify, during the prosecutor’s case-in-chief, that child sexual abuse
victims frequently delay reporting the abuse. Id. at 359-360. The
expert’s testimony helped to dispel common misperceptions held by
jurors regarding the reporting of child sexual abuse, rebutted a n
inference that the victim’s delay was inconsistent with the behavior
of a child sexual abuse victim, and did not improperly bolster the
victim’s credibility. Id. at 379-380.
“Michigan courts regularly admit expert testimony concerning
typical and relevant symptoms of abuse, such as delayed reporting
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-47
Section 4.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
and secrecy.” People v Muniz, 343 Mich App 437, 443 (2022). I n
Muniz, an expert witness “provided a general explanation of sexual-
assault victims’ behavior following an assault” and “gave testimony
regarding a wide range of many aspects of such behavior.” Id. a t
445. The Court of Appeals concluded that the expert’s “testimony
properly gave a general explanation of ‘the common postinciden t
behavior of children who are victims of sexual abuse’” under
Peterson. Muniz, 343 Mich App at 445. The Court rejected th e
defendant’s argument that an expert’s “testimony lacked reliability
because it appeared to be based on his training and experience
treating victims rather than academic studies.” Id. at 443. Th e
Michigan Supreme Court “long has recognized that there ha s
developed a body of knowledge and experience about the
symptomatology of child abuse victimization” “that serves only t o
define the broad range of possible physical, psychological, and
emotional reactions that a child victim could potentially
experience.” Id. at 443 (cleaned up). The “purpose of allowing
expert testimony in these kinds of cases is to give the jury a
framework of possible alternatives for the behaviors, and to provide
sufficient background information about each individual behavior
at issue which will help the jury to dispel any popular
misconception commonly associated with the demonstrated
reaction.” Id. at 444 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “[I] n
addition to his work in treating over 300 victims of abuse, [the
expert witness] testified regarding his training, continuing
education through conferences and training sessions, and research,
all sources of his knowledge.” Id. at 444 (noting that a witness ma y
be qualified “as an expert [under MRE 702] by knowledge, skill,
experience, training, or education”). The Court noted tha t
“[a]lthough defendant’s affiant may disagree with several of [the
expert’s] assertions, his affidavit does not establish that the totality
of [the expert’s] testimony lacked reliability or admissibility.”Id. a t
445. Accordingly, the Muniz Court held that the exper t
appropriately “defined the parameters of his knowledge base,
which were adequate to qualify him.” Id. at 445.
In People v Thorpe, 504 Mich 230, 235 (2019), the prosecutor
presented “testimony from an expert in the area of child sexual
abuse and disclosure about the rate of false reports of sexual abuse
by children to rebut testimony elicited on cross-examination tha t
children can lie and manipulate.” The expert witness “als o
identified only two specific scenarios in his experience whe n
children might lie, neither of which applie[d to the] case,” whic h
“for all intents and purposes” constituted improper vouching
because the testimony could lead to the reasonable conclusion tha t
“there was a 0% chance [the complainant] had lied about sexual
abuse.” Id. at 259. Accordingly, “expert witnesses may not testif y
that children overwhelmingly do not lie when reporting sexual
Page 4-48 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.3
abuse because such testimony improperly vouches for the
complainant’s veracity.” Id. at 235. “Because the trial turned on the
jury’s assessment of [the complainant’s] credibility, the improperly
admitted testimony wherein [the expert] vouched for [the
complainant’s] credibility likely affected the jury’s ultimate
decision.” Id. at 260.
In People v Harbison, the case consolidated with Thorpe, the Michiga n
Supreme Court considered “the admissibility of expert testimony
from an examining physician that ‘diagnosed’ the complainant wit h
‘probable pediatric sexual abuse’ despite not having made any
physical findings of sexual abuse to support that conclusion.”
Thorpe, 504 Mich at 235. The Court concluded that “examinin g
physicians cannot testify that a complainant has been sexually
assaulted or has been diagnosed with sexual abuse without physical
evidence that corroborates the complainant’s account of sexual
assault or abuse because such testimony vouches for the
complainant’s veracity and improperly interferes with the role of the
jury.” Id. “An examining physician’s opinion is objectionable when i t
is solely based ‘on what the victim . . . told’ the physician.” Id. a t
255, quoting People v Smith, 425 Mich 98, 109 (1986) (admission of
the physician’s testimony constituted plain error affecting the
defendant’s substantial rights requiring a new trial). “Suc h
testimony is not permissible because a jury [is] in just as good a
position to evaluate the victim’s testimony as the doctor.” Thorpe,
504 Mich at 255 (quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration i n
the original). See also People v Uribe, 508 Mich 898 (2021) (findin g
that the testimony of a doctor who “repeatedly testified to the
ultimate issue of the case–whether the complainant was sexually
abused–and this testimony lacked physical corroboration,” wa s
“impermissible because it vouche[d] for the complainant’ s
credibility and veracity and invade[d] the province of the jury t o
determine this issue”; a “curative instruction employed by the trial
court could not erase the prejudice the defendant suffered by way of
this testimony,” and “the trial court abused its discretion by denying
the defendant’s motion for a mistrial”).
“Harbison, . . . and the cases on which [it] relied, establish a bright-
line rule that an examining physician’s opinion that a complainan t
was sexually abused is admissible only if supported by physical
findings,” because “[i]n the absence of physical findings, i t
necessarily follows that the physician’s opinion is solely based o n
[their] assessment of the complainant’s statements.” People v Del Cid
(On Remand), 331 Mich App 532, 547 (2020). The Del Cid Cour t
concluded that a diagnosis of “’[p]ossible pediatric sexual abuse’ i s
not significantly different from ‘probable pediatric sexual abuse’ [a s
was at issue in Harbison] in terms of the physician’s endorsement of
the accusation. In both instances, the examining physician speaks t o
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-49
Section 4.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
the likelihood of abuse in the absence of any physical evidence and
couches it in terms of a medical diagnosis.” Del Cid (On Remand),
331 Mich App at 547. Furthermore, even if “possible sexual abuse”
was considered to be “significantly different from ‘probable sexual
abuse,’” it would be precluded under MRE 403 because
“[t]estimony that the ‘diagnosis’ is merely ‘possible’ has very little
probative value while, for the reasons discussed in Harbison, suc h
testimony is highly prejudicial.” Del Cid (On Remand), 331 Mich App
at 548, 550 (“a ‘diagnosis’ of sexual abuse absent physical findings i s
a term of art and has no probative value at trial”; admission of
expert testimony regarding “possible pediatric sexual abuse” absen t
corroborating physical evidence constituted error that “affected
defendant’s substantial rights”).
In Sattler-VanWagoner, an expert witness impermissibly vouched for
the victim’s “credibility by testifying that false reports were
‘statistically very rare in cases like this’ for two reasons.” Sattler-
VanWagoner, ___ Mich App at ___. “First, although [the expert] did
not provide a specific percentage value, her comment on the
statistical rarity of a false report was sufficiently similar to bring her
testimony within the scope of Thorpe’s prohibitions.” Id. at ___
(reasoning there was no “meaningful difference between saying tha t
the likelihood a complainant will lie is 2% to 4% and saying that it i s
‘statistically very rare’”). “Second, the addition of the phrase ‘i n
cases like this’ comes dangerously close to commenting directly o n
[the victim’s] truthfulness or veracity in this case.” Id. at ___ (“Tha t
phrase directly linked the statistical likelihood of a false report t o
the testimony in this case.”).
Expert testimony may be admissible regarding patterns of behavior
exhibited by adult sex offenders to desensitize child victims. People v
Ackerman, 257 Mich App 434, 442 (2003). In Ackerman, befor e
committing acts of sexual misconduct, the defendant repeatedly
allowed his pants to fall down, exposing his genitals, to several girl s
at a youth community center. Id. at 441. The Court stated that thi s
behavior “supported an inference that defendant’s actions were par t
of a system of desensitizing girls to sexual misconduct.” Id. In
addition, the Court affirmed the trial court’s decision to allow a n
expert to testify as to the common practices of child molesters,
which often includes desensitizing the victim. Id. at 443-444. The
Court stated:
“We believe that most of our citizen-jurors lack direc t
knowledge of or experience with the typical forms o f
conduct engaged in by adults who sexually abus e
children. Accordingly, the trial court reasonabl y
concluded that testimony about the typical patterns o f
Page 4-50 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.3
behavior exhibited by child sexual abuse offender s
would aid the jury.” Ackerman, 257 Mich App at 445.
C. Shaken Baby Syndrome (Abusive Head Trauma)
Abusive head trauma (also commonly known as shaken baby
syndrome) is “the ‘constellations of injuries that are caused by the
directed application of force to an infant or young child, resulting i n
physical injury to the head and/or its contents.’” People v McFarlane,
325 Mich App 507, 520 (2018), quoting The American Academy of
Pediatrics (2009). Within the medical community, there is a debate
about the reliability of a diagnosis “that a particular child’s injurie s
were the result of inflicted trauma.” McFarlane, 325 Mich App at 521.
However, “courts continue to allow experts to offer the diagnosis o n
the ground that it is accepted and reliable.” Id. In these cases, “ a
physician may properly offer an opinion that, when the medical
evidence is considered along with the child’s history, the child’ s
injuries were inflicted rather than caused by accident or disease
because a jury is unlikely to be able to assess the medical evidence.”
Id. at 522. “Expressing an opinion that the trauma was inflicted o r
not accidental does not impermissibly invade the province of the
jury because the expert is not expressing an opinion regarding the
defendant’s guilt or whether the defendant had a culpable state of
mind, which the expert may not do.” Id. at 523. “Instead, the exper t
is interpreting the medical evidence and offering the opinion tha t
the trauma was caused by human agency, and the jury is free t o
reject that opinion on the basis of the evidence adduced at trial,
including a contrary opinion by another expert.” Id.
“Notwithstanding the propriety of a diagnosis of inflicted
trauma, . . . in cases involving allegations of abuse, an expert goe s
too far when he or she diagnoses the injury as ‘abusive head
trauma’ or opines that the inflicted trauma amounted to child
abuse.” McFarlane, 325 Mich App at 523. “The ordinar y
understanding of the term ‘abuse’ – as opposed to neglect or
carelessness – implies a level of willfulness and moral culpability
that implicates the defendant’s intent or knowledge whe n
performing the act that caused the head trauma. An expert may no t
offer an opinion on the intent or criminal responsibility of the
accused.” Id. at 523-526 (citation omitted) (holding that it was plai n
error to allow the expert witness to use the phrase “abusive head
trauma” and to agree that the injuries amounted to “child abuse,”
but that the error did not effect the outcome of the trial given the
“totality of the evidence [to support a finding] that defendan t
became angry with [the victim], violently shook her out of
frustration, and caused the injuries at issue”).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-51
Section 4.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“[T]he diagnostic term ‘abusive head trauma’ . . . invade[s] th e
province of the jury when used in cases involving allegations of
abuse, even if it is medically possible to determine that a particular
injury was nonaccidentally inflicted and the term constitutes a
formal diagnosis recognized in the medical community. Therefore,
use of the term automatically constitutes plain error.” People v Ackley
(On Remand), 336 Mich App 586, 592 (2021). However, it is no t
improper under McFarlane “for any of the prosecution’s experts t o
testify that, in their opinion, [a victim] did not sustain [their] injurie s
by accident or self-directed misadventure. Rather, the experts [are]
prohibited from characterizing the nonaccidental way in whic h
those injuries were sustained as ‘abuse’ or ‘abusive.’” Ackley, 33 6
Mich App at 595. In Ackley, “the use of the term ‘abuse’ by some o f
the prosecution’s experts [did not make] any difference to the
outcome in light of the other overwhelming evidence of defendant’ s
guilt.” Id. at 603. “The overwhelming majority of the prosecution’s
expert witnesses provided concrete, permissible testimony to the
effect that [the victim] sustained drastic injuries that either could no t
have been accidental or self-inflicted, or were highly unlikely t o
have been accidental of self-inflicted. Not all of them used the word
‘abuse,’ or at least did not do so on direct examination.” Id. at 602 .
“The term ‘abusive head trauma’ was raised for the first time during
[the expert’s] testimony by the defense on cross-examination,” and
“although [the expert] used the word ‘trauma’ during direc t
examination, she did not use any variation on the word ‘abuse’ at all
during direct examination. To the extent there was any error
regarding the word ‘abuse’ during [the expert’s] testimony, any suc h
error was attributable to defendant and was not grounds for relief.”
Id. at 598 n 5.

involving Shaken Baby Syndrome, see Section 4.1(A)(3), People v
Hawkins, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023), and People v Lemons, __ _
Mich ___ (2024).
Committee Tip:
As can be seen with other areas of expertise,
issues arise not so much as to the qualifications
of the expert but rather as to the breadth of the
opinion rendered. Care should be taken not to
conflate the two.
Page 4-52 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.3
D. Medical Torture Diagnosis
“[T]he term ‘medical torture’ is a medical diagnosis reserved for
only severe cases in which the victim is subjected to at least tw o
instances of physical harm and two instances of psychological harm,
but does not suggest any amount of intentionality.” People v
Alexander, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). In Alexander, the
prosecution’s expert witness, “an expert in general pediatrics and
child abuse pediatrics, shared that she made a medical, not legal
diagnosis of ‘medical torture’ after having the opportunity t o
review the minor child’s medical records, conduct a physical
examination, and interview [the minor child].” Id. at ___. Notably,
the prosecution’s expert witness “did not suggest that defendan t
acted knowingly or intentionally when she testified that the
children were diagnosed with medical torture or addressed any
element of the crime charged.” Id. at ___. “While [the exper t
witness] opined that [the minor child’s] injuries indicated that the
minor child was exposed to at least two distinct physical assault s
and at least two psychological maltreatments, warranting a
diagnosis of ‘medical torture,’ she [explained that] her diagnosi s
was a consequence of her review of the medical records admitted i n
evidence, which included photographs of the ligature marks on [the
minor child’s] extremities and an x-ray of the minor child’s ankles.”
Id. at ___. “Thus, even without the employment of terminology
‘medical torture,’ [the expert witness] could have properly testified
about the extent of [the minor child’s] injuries, the nonaccidental
nature of the minor child’s injuries, his repeated exposure t o
physical assault and psychological harm, and the nature of [the
minor child’s] statements during his examination.” Id. at ___.
“Where it is possible to draw a medical diagnosis based on a
physical examination, as opposed to a complainant’s self-reporting,
an expert is fully permitted to testify that, in their opinion, a
particular injury was not accidentally self-inflicted.” Id. at ___
(cleaned up). Accordingly, “even if the trial court plainly erred by
allowing [the expert witness] to use the label ‘medical torture,’ i t
[was] unlikely that the error affected the outcome of the trial
considering the evidence presented.” Id. at ___ (noting that the trial
court properly instructed the jury that it could consider the expert’ s
testimony as to why she reached her conclusions but not a s
evidence that the events actually happened).

4.4 Medical Malpractice—Expert Testimony
A. Requirements
“In a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff bears the burden of
proving: (1) the applicable standard of care, (2) breach of tha t
standard of care by defendant, (3) injury, and (4) proximate
causation between the alleged breach and the injury.” Stokes v
Swofford, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). Generally, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice actio n
“must produce expert testimony to support their position as to the
standard of care in their case and that the standard was breached.”
Danhoff v Fahim, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024). “The proponent of exper t
testimony in a medical malpractice case must satisfy the court tha t
the expert is qualified under MRE 702, MCL 600.2955, and MCL
600.2169.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
MRE 702 “guides the admissibility of the testimony of medical
experts in medical malpractice litigation who aver in affidavits of
merit as to the applicable medical standard of care and whether tha t
standard of care was breached.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (noting
that “it is generally not sufficient to simply point to an expert’ s
experience and background to argue that the expert’s opinion i s
reliable and, therefore, admissible”). “‘A court considering whether
to admit expert testimony under MRE 702 acts as a gatekeeper and
has a fundamental duty to ensure that the proffered exper t
testimony is both relevant and reliable.’” People v Jones, ___ Mich
App ___, ___ (2025), quoting People v Kowalski, 492 Mich 106, 12 0
(2012). MRE 702 provides:
“A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,
skill, experience, training, or education may testify i n
the form of an opinion or otherwise if the proponen t
demonstrates to the court that it is more likely than no t
that:
(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other
specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact t o
understand the evidence or to determine a fact i n
issue;
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or
data;
17 This section includes information on expert testimony that is specific to medical malpractice cases. See
Section 4.1 for general information on expert testimony. See also the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Medical
Malpractice - Criteria for Admission of Expert Testimony Flowchart.
Page 4-54 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.4
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable
principles and methods; and
(d) the expert’s opinion reflects a reliable
application of the principles and methods to the
facts of the case.” MRE 702.
To effectuate its gatekeeper role, a court must focus its inquiry
“solely on principles and methodology, not the conclusions tha t
they generate.” Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharm, Inc, 509 US 579, 59 5
(1993). The Daubert test “requires the trial judge to make a
preliminary assessment of whether the proposed expert’s testimony
is scientifically valid and whether the reasoning and methodology
upon which the expert bases their testimony can be applied to the
facts in the case.”Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (citation omitted).
“Further guidance as to the reliability of medical expert testimony
comes from MCL 600.2955[, which] expresses that the keys t o
admissibility are relevance and reliability.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___.
MCL 600.2955 codifies the Daubert test “[i]n an action for the deat h
of a person or for injury to a person or property[.]”
“MCL 600.2955 presents a nonexhaustive list of seven factors that a
trial court shall consider when it determines whether an expert’ s
opinions are reliable.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___. Specifically, the
seven factors are:
“(a) Whether the opinion and its basis have bee n
subjected to scientific testing and replication.
(b) Whether the opinion and its basis have bee n
subjected to peer review publication.
(c) The existence and maintenance of generally accepted
standards governing the application and interpretatio n
of a methodology or technique and whether the opinio n
and its basis are consistent with those standards.
(d) The known or potential error rate of the opinion an d
its basis.
(e) The degree to which the opinion and its basis ar e
generally accepted within the relevant exper t
community. As used in this subdivision, “relevan t
expert community” means individuals who ar e
knowledgeable in the field of study and are gainfull y
employed applying that knowledge on the free market.
(f) Whether the basis for the opinion is reliable an d
whether experts in that field would rely on the sam e
basis to reach the type of opinion being proffered.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-55
Section 4.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(g) Whether the opinion or methodology is relied upo n
by experts outside of the context of litigation.” MCL
600.2955(1).
“Neither MRE 702 nor MCL 600.2955 requires a trial court to
exclude the testimony of a plaintiff’s expert on the basis of the
plaintiff’s failure to support their expert’s claims with published
literature.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___. “Expert testimony i s
inadmissible when it does not meet the reliability requirements of
MRE 702, MCL 600.2955, and MCL 600.2169—not because the
expert’s testimony was not or could not be supported by peer-
reviewed literature.”Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___.
Trial counsel was not ineffective when she withdrew a Daubert
motion to exclude the medical examiner’s testimony that all of th e
victim’s bruises were sustained at the same time. People v Jones, ___
Mich App ___, ___ (2025). In Jones, the trial court did not specifically
address the question of whether defendant established in the
Ginther hearing that [the medical examiner’s] findings as to the age
of the injuries was based on a scientifically unsound method, but i t
found that defendant’s challenges to [her] methods were no t
supported by the record.” Id. at ___. The expert testimony of th e
physician who wrote a report in support of excluding the medical
examiner’s testimony “did not require the trial court to continue the
Daubert hearing.” Id. at ___ (concluding that his “testimon y
established that examination of every bruise could be a better
method, but not necessarily that [the medical examiner’s] method
was unacceptable”) (The medical examiner “testified that there is n o
protocol from the National Association of Medical Examiner s
requiring microscopic examination of every bruise.”).
“Furthermore, [the expert’s] critique of [the medical examiner’s ]
methods addressed only a secondary aspect of [her] testimony.” Id.
at ___. The medical examiner “testified that the transection of the
superior mesenteric vein was caused by a powerful blow to the
abdomen within hours of [the victim’s] death.” Id. at ___. “She
testified that ordinary childhood accidents, such as [the victim]
experienced in the week before her death, could not have caused the
traumatic injuries.” Id. at ___. “Therefore, even if [the medical
examiner] had been precluded from testifying about the age of the
bruises, her testimony regarding the internal injuries would still
have placed the time of [the victim’s] injuries in the hours preceding
her loss of consciousness.” Id. at ___ (holding that defendant failed
“to establish that trial counsel’s withdrawal of the Daubert motio n
was an objectively unreasonable error or a reasonable probability of
a more favorable outcome if the motion had continued”).
“MCL 600.2912d(1) mandates that the plaintiff in a medical
malpractice action ‘file with the complaint an affidavit of meri t
Page 4-56 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.4
signed by a health professional who the plaintiff’s attorney
reasonably believes meets the requirements for an expert witnes s
under MCL 600.2169.’” Stokes v Swofford, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024).
MCL 600.2169 sets forth the qualifications necessary for an exper t
witness to testify regarding the standard of care in medical
malpractice cases. “The ‘matching’ required by MCL 600.2169(1) i s
limited to general board specialties and does not require precise
matching of subspecialties.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___ (“emphasiz[ing]
that a trial court must ensure that experts with matching specialtie s
under MCL 600.2169(1) meet other criteria set forth in MCL
600.2169(2) and that MCL 600.2169(3) provides trial courts with
broad discretion in assessing experts”).
“Admission of expert testimony . . . does not depend on an expert’ s
being exactly as knowledgeable as a defendant in a medical
malpractice action.” Albro v Drayer, 303 Mich App 758, 763 (2014 )
(holding that the defendant’s experts satisfied MCL 600.2169(1)).
There is “no rule, statute, or binding authority requiring identical
experience and expertise between a party and an expert[.]” Id. I n
Albro, the plaintiff argued that the defendant’s experts were
“unqualified to render an opinion regarding defendant’ s
compliance with the standard of care because they ha[d] little or no,
or at least no recent, personal experience actually performing the
specific surgical procedure defendant performed.” Id. at 761-762.
Although “none of defendant’s experts were as familiar with the
[specific] procedure as was defendant, . . . all of them were familiar
with the [specific] procedure.” Id. at 762-763. Accordingly, “[t]he tria l
court did not abuse its discretion by finding that defendant’s expert s
were, at a minimum, sufficiently knowledgeable, trained, or
educated to form an expert opinion under MRE 702 . . . [and] non e
of the considerations under MCL 600.2169(2) demand[ed] that th e
experts be excluded.” Albro, 303 Mich App at 763.
MCL 600.2169 “does not impermissibly infringe on [the Suprem e
Court’s] constitutional rule-making authority over ‘practice and
procedure.’” McDougall v Schanz, 461 Mich 15, 37 (1999).
“A party must move to strike an expert within a reasonable time
after learning the expert’s [sic: identity] and basic qualifications. The
failure to timely do so results in forfeiture of the issue.” Cox v Flint
Bd of Hosp Mgrs (On Remand), 243 Mich App 72, 80 (2000), rev’d o n

other grounds 467 Mich 1 (2002) (citation omitted).

Section 4.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
B. Standard of Care
1. Generally
“Generally, expert testimony is required in a malpractice cas e
in order to establish the applicable standard of care and t o
demonstrate that the professional breached that standard. ”
Elher v Misra, 499 Mich 11, 21 (2016) (quotation marks an d
citations omitted). “The proponent of the evidence has th e
burden of establishing its relevance and admissibility.” Id. a t
22. “The standard of care is controlled by how other physician s
in a field of medicine would act when providing the sam e
treatment.” Stokes v Swofford, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024). “Th e
standard of care for general practitioners is subject to th e
locality rule, which holds that the relevant standard of care i s
that which applies ‘in the community in which the defendan t
practices or in a similar community[.]’” Id. at ___ n 1, quotin g
MCL 600.2912a(1)(a). “On the other hand, physician specialist s
and experts are held to a fieldwide standard of care.” Stokes,
___ Mich at ___ n 1 (explaining that specialists are measured b y
a national standard because the public’s reliance “upon th e
skills of a specialist and the wealth and sources of hi s
knowledge are not limited to the geographic area in which h e
practices”) (cleaned up). Put simply, general practitioners ar e
held to a local or similar community standard of care;
specialists are held to a nationwide standard of care. Cudnik v
William Beaumont Hosp, 207 Mich App 378, 383 (1994).
Nurses are not engaged in the practice of medicine and are,
therefore, not held to the same standard of care as genera l
practitioners or specialists. Decker v Rochowiak, 287 Mich App
666, 686 (2010). “Rather, the common-law standard of car e
applies to malpractice actions against nurses. The applicabl e
standard of care is the skill and care ordinarily possessed an d
exercised by practitioners of the profession in the same o r
similar localities. The standard of care required of a nurse mus t
be established by expert testimony.” Id. (quotation marks ,
alteration, and citations omitted). In Decker, the defendant
appealed because the “plaintiff’s expert reviewed the case ‘i n
light of a “national” standard of care’” as opposed to a loca l
one. Id. at 685. The Court of Appeals concluded that, althoug h
the expert stated she was applying a national standard of car e
to her testimony, “the actual substance of [her] length y
testimony was that the procedures at issue [in Decker were] s o
commonplace that the same standard of care applied locally
and nationally. . . . Thus, plaintiff’s expert applied the prope r
standard of care, which happened to be the same locally a s
well as nationally.” Id. at 686-687.
Page 4-58 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.4
MCL 600.2169(1)(b) “states that the expert must have spent th e
majority of his or her time the year preceding the allege d
malpractice practicing or teaching the specialty the defendan t
physician was practicing at the time of the allege d
malpractice.” Kiefer v Markley, 283 Mich App 555, 559 (2009).
Accordingly, the Court concluded that the proposed exper t
physician must “spend greater than 50 percent of his or he r
professional time practicing the relevant specialty the yea r
before the alleged malpractice.” Id.
The requirement in MCL 600.2169(1)(b)(i) that the expert b e
engaged in “active clinical practice” does not “require that th e
professional physically interact with patients. Rather, the wor d
‘active’ must be understood to mean that, as part of his or he r
normal professional practice at the relevant time, th e
professional was involved—directly or indirectly—in the car e
of patients in a clinical setting.” Gay v Select Specialty Hosp, 295
Mich App 284, 297 (2012). Likewise, “[t]he Legislature’ s
statement [in MCL 600.2169(1)(b)(ii)] that the professional ma y
meet the time requirement by devoting the majority of his o r
her time to the instruction of students [does not mean] that th e
professional must actually spend a majority of his or her tim e
instructing students.” Gay, 295 Mich App at 300. “It i s
commonly understood that a person who teaches—and
especially with regard to persons who teach a profession—
must spend significant time preparing for class, maintainin g
familiarity with new and evolving professional techniques,
and participating in meetings designed to further th e
educational process.” Id.
“Neither MRE 702 nor MCL 600.2955 requires a trial court t o
exclude the testimony of a plaintiff’s expert on the basis of th e
plaintiff’s failure to support their expert’s claims wit h
published literature.” Danhoff v Fahim, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024)
(“Although published literature may be an important factor i n
determining reliability, it is not a dispositive factor . . . .”). I n
Danhoff, the plaintiff’s expert “opined that because a bowel
perforation like plaintiff experienced is so rare and so likely t o
have been caused by a medical instrument in an area it shoul d
not have been that it constitutes a breach of the standard o f
care.” Id. at ___. “The trial court determined that [plaintiff’ s
expert’s] opinion was unreliable almost exclusively because h e
did not cite supportive literature without considering whethe r
(1) [plaintiff’s expert] could have produced such supportiv e
literature, (2) defendant produced any literature or othe r
evidence to contradict [plaintiff’s expert’s] opinion, and (3 )
[plaintiff’s expert’s] opinion was otherwise sufficiently reliabl e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-59
Section 4.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
under the factors provided by statute and MRE 702.” Danhoff,
___ Mich at ___.
The Danhoff Court held that “scientific literature is not alway s
required to support an expert’s standard-of-care opinion, bu t
that scientific literature is one of the factors that a trial cour t
should consider when determining whether the opinion i s
reliable.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (stating that “peer-reviewed,
published literature is not always a necessary or sufficien t
method of meeting the requirements of MRE 702, thu s
establishing reliability”) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “[A]n expert in a medical malpractice lawsuit [ma y
be able to] reliably support their opinion on the standard o f
care [even] if the adverse event is so rare that published, peer-
reviewed medical literature on the subject may not exist.” Id. a t
___. “[E]ach case will present unique circumstances for a tria l
court to determine whether the expert’s opinion is reliable.” Id.
at ___. “In some cases, a lack of supportive literature may b e
fatal to a plaintiff’s expert’s reliability.” Id. at ___. “In others, a
plaintiff’s expert may demonstrate reliability withou t
supportive literature, especially where a complication is rar e
and there is a dearth of supportive literature available t o
support the opinion.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the guidepos t
for admissibility is reliability, and trial courts must conside r
MRE 702 as well as the statutory reliability factors presented in
MCL 600.2955 when determining if an expert is reliable”).
“Treating a lack of supportive medical literature as dispositiv e
that the expert’s opinions are unreliable and, therefore,
inadmissible, creates a conundrum.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___.
“If the failure to produce medical literature means that a
plaintiff’s otherwise reliable expert opinions are inadmissible,
patients who experience complications so rare that they are no t
studied by the academic community or discussed in peer-
reviewed publications would not be able to offer admissibl e
expert testimony when seeking legal recourse for thei r
injuries.” Id. at ___. “The avoidance of such a result is why
MCL 600.2955 has several factors and does not merely specif y
that reliability is a product of peer-reviewed medica l
literature.” Danhoff, ___ Mich at ___ (“It is also why we have
consistently noted that peer-reviewed medical literature is no t
always necessary or sufficient to meet reliabilit y
requirements.”) (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Ultimately, in Danhoff, the Michigan Supreme Court held tha t
“[t]he lower courts erred by concluding that [plaintiff’ s
expert’s] opinions were unreliable because they wer e
unsupported by medical literature.” Id. at ___ (“The trial cour t
abused its discretion by inadequately assessing [plaintiff’ s
Page 4-60 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.4
expert’s] reliability as a standard-of-care expert withou t
appropriately analyzing MRE 702 or the statutory reliability
factors of MCL 600.2955.”).
The number of medical professionals “who use any particula r
procedure is not determinative of the standard of care.” Albro v
Drayer, 303 Mich App 758, 765 (2014) (finding an expert’ s
testimony that a “third” of foot and ankle doctors use a
particular procedure inappropriate because it lacke d
foundation in the record and was not determinative of th e
standard of care).
Timing of establishing the applicable standard of care.
Although a trial court errs by waiting to establish th e
applicable standard of care until after the proofs have closed,
such an error does not always require reversal. Jilek v Stockson,
490 Mich 961, 961-962 (2011). In Jilek, the trial court allowed th e
parties to argue at trial which standard of care applied,
ultimately deciding the issue in the defendants’ favor after th e
close of proofs. Id. at 961. However, because the trial court ha d
been misled by the plaintiff’s own arguments, and it did no t
preclude the plaintiff from presenting standard-of-car e
testimony for both specialties, upholding the jury’s verdict i n
favor of the defendants was not “‘inconsistent with substantia l
justice,’ [under] MCR 2.613(A).” Jilek, 490 Mich at 962.
Nurse midwives. Obstetricians/gynecologists are not qualified
to testify regarding the standard of care applicable to nurs e
midwives because they do not practice in “the same healt h
profession” as a nurse midwife. McElhaney v Harper-Hutzel
Hosp, 269 Mich App 488, 496-497 (2006). The Court stated:
“Though it may appear reasonable that a physicia n
with substantial educational and professional
credentials should be able to testify about the
standard of care of a nurse who works in a closely
related field, we are constrained by the plai n
words of the statute [(MCL 600.2169(1)(b)] that the
expert witness must practice in the ‘same healt h
profession.’ Consequently, we conclude tha t
because nurse midwives are separately licensed
professionals who practice nursing with specialty
certification in the practice of nurse midwifery,
obstetricians/gynecologists may not testify abou t
their standard of practice or care.” McElhaney, 26 9
Mich App at 497.
Physician’s assistant. Where a party seeks to admit exper t
testimony regarding the appropriate standard of care for a
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-61
Section 4.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
physician assistant, MCL 600.2169(1)(b) applies because MCL
600.2169(1)(a) and MCL 600.2169(1)(c) apply only t o
physicians, and MCL 600.2169(1)(b) applies both to physician s
and other health professionals, which includes physicia n
assistants. Wolford v Duncan, 279 Mich App 631, 635-637 (2008) .
Similarly, MCL 600.2169(1)(b) applies to expert witnesse s
testifying as to the standard of care for nurses. Gay, 295 Mic h
App at 294.
2. Specialists
A specialist is “a physician whose practice is limited to a
particular branch of medicine or surgery, especially one who,
by virtue of advanced training, is certified by a specialty boar d
as being qualified to so limit his practice.” Stokes v Swofford, __ _
Mich ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted )
(noting that “a physician can be a specialist who is not board
certified—and that a specialist is somebody who ca n
potentially become board certified”).
MCL 600.2169(1) requires a proposed expert to meet certai n
criteria when a defendant is a specialist. The statute states, i n
relevant part:
“(1) In an action alleging medical malpractice, a
person shall not give expert testimony on the
appropriate standard of practice or care unless the
person is licensed as a health professional in thi s
state or another state and meets the following
criteria:
(a) If the party against whom or on whos e
behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist,
specializes at the time of the occurrence that i s
the basis for the action in the same specialt y
as the party against whom or on whose behal f
the testimony is offered. However, if the part y
against whom or on whose behalf th e
testimony is offered is a specialist who i s
board certified, the expert witness must be a
specialist who is board certified in tha t
specialty.
(b) Subject to subdivision (c), during the yea r
immediately preceding the date of th e
occurrence that is the basis for the claim o r
action, devoted a majority of his or he r
professional time to either or both of th e
following:
Page 4-62 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.4
(i) The active clinical practice of the sam e
health profession in which the party
against whom or on whose behalf the
testimony is offered is licensed and, if
that party is a specialist, the active
clinical practice of that specialty.
(ii) The instruction of students in a n
accredited health professional school or
accredited residency or clinical researc h
program in the same health professio n
in which the party against whom or o n
whose behalf the testimony is offered i s
licensed and, if that party is a specialist,
an accredited health professional school
or accredited residency or clinical
research program in the same specialty.”
“MCL 600.2169(1)(a) says that if the defendant physician is a
specialist, then the expert must practice or teach in the ‘sam e
specialty.’” Stokes v Swofford, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024).
“Similarly, the statute states that if the defendant physician ‘i s
a specialist who is board certified, the expert witness must be a
specialist who is board certified in that specialty.’” Id. at ___ ,
quoting MCL 600.2169(1)(a). “[T]he words ‘specialist’ and
‘specialties’ as used in MCL 600.2169(1) are defined as the
specialties recognized by the American Board of Medical
Specialties (ABMS), the American Osteopathic Associatio n
(AOA), the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS), o r
other similar nationally recognized umbrella-based physicia n
certifying entities.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___. “[T]he ‘matching’
requirement under MCL 600.2169 follows the listed genera l
board certifications, which are the baseline ‘specialties ’
recognized by such entities for certification purposes.” Stokes,
___ Mich at ___.
“The statute does not require matching of subspecialties.” Id. a t
___ (“A medical subspecialty is a concentrated area o f
knowledge and skills existing ‘within a specialty’ requirin g
additional training and education.”). “Nowhere in th e
language of MCL 600.2169 is there a reference t o
‘subspecialties.’” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___, overruling in par t
19
Woodard v Custer, 476 Mich 545 (2006). According to th e
Stokes Court, “Woodard incorrectly conflated the term s
‘specialty’ and ‘subspecialty’ in a manner that is inconsisten t
with the plain language of the statute, and it essentiall y
19 For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-63
Section 4.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
negated MCL 600.2169(2) and (3), which provide significan t
discretion to trial courts to exclude experts even when suc h
experts qualify under [MCL 600.2169(2)].” Stokes, ___ Mich a t
___.
Level of certification/matching of credentials. “Board
certified” is defined as a “certification from an official group o f
persons who direct or supervise the practice of medicine tha t
provides evidence of one’s medical qualifications.” Stokes, ___
Mich at ___ n 14 (citation omitted). However, a “‘boar d
certification’ that requires prerequisites set forth by a mor e
general umbrella certification applies in the same way to both a
‘specialty’ and ‘subspecialty.’” Id. (“recogniz[ing] that a
subspecialty is different from a specialty”). “While both ma y
require ‘board certifications’ from a professional organization,
a certification that requires as a prerequisite the possession o f
another more general board certification (a ‘specialty’) from an
umbrella-certifying entity before seeking further certification i s
a subspecialty for purposes of MCL 600.2169.” Stokes, ___ Mic h
at ___ n 14. “The “matching” required by MCL 600.2169(1) i s
limited to general board specialties and does not requir e
precise matching of subspecialties.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___.
Timing of board certification. “[A] proposed expert’s board-
certification qualification [under MCL 600.2169(1)(a)] is based
on the expert’s board-certification status at the time of th e
alleged malpractice rather than at the time of the testimony. ”
Rock v Crocker, 499 Mich 247, 251 (2016). “On the basis of th e
plain language of [MCL 600.2169] and contextual clues fro m
the surrounding provisions, . . . both the specialty and board-
certification requirements [of MCL 600.2169(1)(a)] apply at th e
time of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action. ”
Rock, 499 Mich at 261-262 (additionally noting, however, tha t
“[w]ith respect to the licensure requirement[ of MCL
600.2169(1)], the parties [did] not dispute that the expert mus t
be licensed at the time of the testimony”) (emphasis added).
Internal medicine. “Internal medicine is recognized as a
specialty” with “more than 20 subspecialties that often hav e
little to do with one another.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___. “For

subspecialists under the specialty of internal medicine.” Id. a t
___. “A pulmonologist is an internal medicine physician wh o
specializes in the respiratory system.” Id. at ___ n 17. “A
cardiologist is an internal medicine physician who specialize s
in the heart.” Id. at ___ n 18. “Concerns have been raised tha t
doing away with consideration of subspecialties for purpose s
of the matching requirement would mean that a pulmonologis t
would then be qualified to testify against a cardiologist sinc e

both share the same specialty.” Id. at ___. “However, thi s
argument ignores MCL 600.2169(2) and (3).” Stokes, ___ Mic h
at ___. “Even if expert specialties ‘match’ under MCL
600.2169(1), the trial court still has discretion on whether t o
accept the expert as qualified to provide testimony in a
particular case.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___.
Radiology specialties. “Neuroradiology is a subspecialty o f
diagnostic radiology; within both disciplines, a physician i s
trained in interpreting bodily images, althoug h
neuroradiologists specialize in interpreting images of th e
brain, spine, head, and neck.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___. In Stokes,
diagnostic radiology was “the one most relevan t
specialty . . . because it was the only specialty that defendan t
held and practiced.” Id. at ___. “Therefore, the proposed exper t
would need to be a specialist in diagnostic radiology, which h e
was.” Id. at ___. “[P]laintiff’s proposed expert . . . practices]
diagnostic radiology whenever he reads a neuroimaging scan. ”
Id. at ___. In other words, plaintiff’s expert “spen[t] 100% of hi s
time practicing the ‘one relevant specialty’—diagnosti c
radiology—and thus he satisfie[d] the requirements unde r
MCL 600.2169(1) to testify as an expert in the case against [the
defendant].” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___ (holding that plaintiff’ s
proposed expert “was qualified because his subspecialty o f
neuroradiology was subsumed within the broader specialty o f
diagnostic radiology”).
Osteopathic/allopathic physician. The fact that defendant-
doctor was a licensed osteopathic physician (D.O.) and th e
doctor who executed an affidavit of merit on plaintiff’s behal f
was a licensed allopathic physician (M.D.) was “not pertinen t
in analyzing MCL 600.2169(1)(b)(i) . . . because the specialty of
obstetrics-gynecology govern[ed] the standard of practice o f
care under MCL 600.2169(1)(a)” and plaintiff’s expert ha d
“devoted a majority of his professional time to the activ e
clinical practice of obstetrics-gynecology” “during the yea r
immediately preceding the alleged act of malpractice[.]” Creg o
v Edward W Sparrow Hosp Ass’n, 327 Mich App 525, 530 (2019).
“[T]he requirements of [MCL 600.2169(1)(a)] were satisfied
because both doctors [were] board-certified OB-GYNs,” and
MCL 600.2169(1)(b) “does not require re-evaluation of whethe r
there are matching credentials. Whether a defendant and a
plaintiff’s expert practiced in the ‘same health profession’ . . .
need only be resolved when a specialty, board-certified o r
otherwise, is not implicated[.]” Crego, 327 Mich App at 533,
535.
Nurses. Where the plaintiff’s proposed nursing expert, a
certified nurse practitioner, “did not spend the majority of he r
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-65
Section 4.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
professional time in the year preceding the alleged malpractic e
practicing or teaching the health profession of a nurse, a s
opposed to the health profession of a nurse practitioner, sh e
did not satisfy the statutory criteria [under MCL
600.2169(1)(b)] to testify concerning the standard of care
applicable to [the defendant], a registered nurse[, and th e
proposed expert witness’s] testimony was therefore properl y
excluded.” Cox v Hartman, 322 Mich App 292, 305 (2017)
(concluding that “[t]he health profession of a nurse and th e
health profession of a nurse practitioner are different, a s
reflected in the fact that the former is practiced pursuant to a
license while the latter is practiced pursuant to a registration o r
specialty certification”).
C. Trial Court Discretion in §600.2169(2) and
§600.2169(3)
“Even if expert specialties ‘match’ under MCL 600.2169(1), the tria l
court still has discretion on whether to accept the expert as qualified
to provide testimony in a particular case.” Stokes v Swofford, ___
Mich ___, ___ (2024) (holding “that a trial court must ensure tha t
experts with matching specialties under MCL 600.2169(1) mee t
other criteria set forth in MCL 600.2169(2) and that MCL 600.2169(3)
provides trial courts with broad discretion in assessing experts”).
“MCL 600.2169(2) mandates that the trial court evaluate all the
following factors:
‘(a) The educational and professional training of th e
expert witness.
(b) The area of specialization of the expert witness.
(c) The length of time the expert witness has bee n
engaged in theactive clinical practice or instruction o f
the health profession or the specialty.
(d) The relevancy of the expert witness’s testimony.’”
Stokes, ___ Mich at ___.
Additionally, “[MCL 600.2169(3)] does not limit the power of th e
trial court to disqualify an expert witness on grounds other than th e
qualifications set forth in [MCL 600.2169].” In Stokes, the Michiga n
Supreme Court “clarif[ied] the standard of care requirements for
expert medical witnesses under MCL 600.2169, as interpreted i n
20
Woodard v Custer.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___ (overruling Woodard “i n

with negative subsequent history, see our note.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.4
part because the test adopted by the Woodard Court regarding th e
evaluation of specialists in medical malpractice actions [was]
inconsistent with the statutory language in MCL 600.2169”).
“Specifically, Woodard incorrectly conflated the terms ‘specialty’ an d
‘subspecialty’ in a manner that [was] inconsistent with the plai n
language of the statute” and “essentially negated MCL 600.2169(2)
and (3), which provide significant discretion to trial courts t o
exclude experts even when such experts qualify under [MCL
600.2169(1)].” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___.
Internal medicine. “Internal medicine is recognized as a specialty ”
with “more than 20 subspecialties that often have little to do wit h
one another.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___. “For instance, a pulmonologis t
and a cardiologist are both subspecialists under the specialty of
internal medicine.” Id. at ___. “A pulmonologist is an internal
medicine physician who specializes in the respiratory system.” Id. at
___ n 17. “A cardiologist is an internal medicine physician wh o
specializes in the heart.” Id. at ___ n 18. “Concerns have been raised
that doing away with consideration of subspecialties for purposes of
the matching requirement would mean that a pulmonologist would
then be qualified to testify against a cardiologist since both share the
same specialty.” Id. at ___. “However, this argument ignores MCL
600.2169(2) and (3).” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___. Indeed, “the trial cour t
would easily exclude a pulmonologist’s testimony [under MCL
600.2169(2)] because the relevancy of that testimony would prov e
futile to ascertaining the cardiologist’s performance.” Id. at ___ .
“Moreover, a trial court could go further under MCL 600.2169(3), ”
which “allows disqualifications by the trial court for other reasons,
meaning an internist who exclusively treats medical condition s
associated with the lungs could be deemed unqualified to testify a s
an expert for an internist who exclusively treats medical condition s
associated with the heart if the alleged malpractice involved a n
alleged error that is specific to the heart.” Stokes, ___ Mich at ___.
D. Exception to Requirement of Expert Testimony
Generally, an expert must testify in a medical malpractice action.
However, “[a]n exception exists when the professional’s breach of
the standard or care is so obvious that it is within the commo n
knowledge and experience of an ordinary layperson.” Elher v Misra,
499 Mich 11, 21-22 (2016).
E. Hospital Regulations, Reports, and Peer Review Records
“[V]iolation of a regulation promulgated pursuant to statutory
authority is admissible in a medical malpractice action,” bu t
hospital policies do not establish the standard of care or its violation.
Gallagher v Detroit-Macomb Hosp Ass’n, 171 Mich App 766 (1988)
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-67
Section 4.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(“[i]n general, the standard required of physicians and nurses . . . i s
not established by internal, administrative rules”). However,
“internal rules and regulations are not categorically inadmissible a s
irrelevant.” Meyers v Rieck, 509 Mich 460, 482 (2022). “[W]hil e
hospital rules and regulations [cannot] establish the standard of
care, they ‘[can] be admissible as reflecting the community’ s
standard where they were adopted by the relevant medical staff and
where there is a causal relationship between the violation of the rule
and the injury.’” Id. at 478, quoting Gallagher, 171 Mich App at 767.
“[A] medical provider’s rules and regulations can be used a s
evidence to help determine the standard of care, but they cannot be
used as the standard itself without additional evidence.” Id. at 480.
“[C]ourts must be cautious in admitting this evidence” and “any
jury receiving such evidence must be instructed as to its proper
use.” Id. at 481. “[A] medical provider’s internal rules and
regulations . . . must meet general evidentiary standards, including
that the evidence be relevant . . . and its probative value must not be
outweighed by the concerns listed in MRE 403.” Meyers, 509 Mich a t
481. Put differently, “[i]f they meet the rules governing the
admission of evidence and if the jury is instructed as to their proper
use — i.e., that they are evidence of the standard of care and do no t
fix the standard itself — then they might be admitted.” Id. at 482.
A hospital incident report or peer review record may be
inadmissible under the peer review privilege set forth by MCL
333.20175(13) and MCL 333.21515. See also Gallagher, 171 Mich App
21
at 769-770. MCL 333.20175(13) and MCL 333.21515 “mak e
privileged all records, data, and knowledge collected for or by a
peer review committee in furtherance of its statutorily mandated
purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality and improving
[22]
patient care. This includes objective facts gathered
contemporaneously with an event contained in an otherwise
privileged incident report.” Krusac v Covenant Med Ctr, Inc, 497 Mich
251, 263 (2015). However, “the scope of the [peer review] privilege i s
not without limit.” Id. at 261. “[T]he privilege only applies t o
records, data, and knowledge that are collected for or by the
committee under [MCL 333.20175(13) and MCL 333.21515] ‘for the
purpose of reducing morbidity and mortality and improving the
care provided in the hospital for patients.’” Krusac, 497 Mich at 261-
23
262, quoting MCL 333.21513(d). “In determining whether any of
the information requested is protected by the statutory privilege,
21At the time Gallagher was decided, the peer-review privilege was located in MCL 333.20175(5); however ,
the statute was subsequently amended, and the peer review subsection of the statute is now MC L

22“MCL 333.21513(d) imposes a duty on hospitals to create peer review committees ‘for the purpose of
reducing morbidity and mortality and improving the care provided in the hospital for patients.’” Krusac v
Covenant Med Ctr, Inc, 497 Mich 251, 256 (2015), quoting MCL 333.21513(d).
Page 4-68 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.4
the trial court should bear in mind that mere submission of
information to a peer review committee does not satisfy the
[24]
collection requirement so as to bring the information within the
protection of the statute. Also, in deciding whether a particular
committee was assigned a review function so that information i t
collected is protected, the court may wish to consider the hospital’ s
bylaws and internal regulations, and whether the committee’ s
function is one of current patient care or retrospective review.”
Monty v Warren Hosp Corp, 422 Mich 138, 146-147 (1985) (citation s
omitted). Moreover, litigants “may still obtain relevant fact s
through eyewitness testimony, including from the author of a
privileged incident report, and from the patient’s medical record.”
Krusac, 497 Mich at 262.
“Nothing in the pertinent language of [MCL 333.20175(13)] suggest s
that the privilege does not extend to a freestanding surgical
outpatient facility exercising the same credentialing review functio n
under MCL 333.20813(c) that a hospital performs under MCL
333.21513(c).” Dorsey v Surgical Institute of Mich, LLC, 338 Mich App
25
199, 228 (2021). MCL 333.21515 references Article 17, “whic h
governs a wide variety of health facilities or agencies, including
freestanding surgical outpatient facilities. However, the specifi c
provision is set forth in Part 215 of Article 17, which addresse s
matters related to the narrower category of entities that constitute
hospitals.” Dorsey, 338 Mich App at 228. “[D]espite the placement of
MCL 333.21515 in Part 215 alongside other provisions applicable t o
hospitals, the Legislature’s reference to the review function s
described in Article 17, as opposed to Part 215, evidences its inten t
to extend the statutory privilege for peer-review materials to all
health facilities and agencies with review functions imposed by
Article 17.” Dorsey, 338 Mich App at 229 (concluding the peer review
privilege in MCL 333.21515 applied to defendant (a freestanding
surgical outpatient facility), that “[t]he plain language of [MCL
333.20175(13)] limited the use of [the credentialing file] to purpose s
provided in Article 17,” and that “the file was not subject t o
discovery and should not have been admitted at trial”).
23At the time Krusac was decided, the peer-review privilege was located in MCL 333.20175(8); however,
the statute was subsequently amended, and the peer review subsection of the statute is now MC L
333.20175(13). See 2023 PA 62.

F. Discovery
A defendant’s attorneys are entitled to communicate ex parte with a
plaintiff’s treating physician when the plaintiff has waived the
26
physician-patient privilege. Domako v Rowe, 438 Mich 347, 362
(1991) (privilege was waived in the Domako case “by lack of timely
assertion”). See also MCR 2.302(C). Pursuant to MCR 2.314(A)(1),
when the mental or physical condition of a party is in controversy,
medical information is generally subject to discovery. Davis v Do w
Corning Corp, 209 Mich App 287, 292-293 (1995). Accordingly, onc e
the patient allows discovery of medical information, there are n o
grounds for restricting access to the patient’s physician. Id. at 293.
G. Weight of Expert Testimony
“[A] jury [can] disregard a physician’s unrebutted testimony[.]”
Taylor Estate v Univ Physician Group, 329 Mich App 268, 282 (2019).
“[A] jury may disbelieve the most positive evidence even when i t
stands uncontradicted, and the judge cannot take from them their
right of judgment[.]” Strach v St John Hosp Corp, 160 Mich App 251 ,

285 Mich App 80, 89-90 (2009); Martin v Ledingham, 488 Mich 987,
987-988 (2010). “[A] jury is free to credit or discredit any testimony.”
Kelly v Builders Square, Inc, 465 Mich 29, 39 (2001). “That th e
physicians involved . . . are professional observers does not change
the rule that their eyewitness testimony may be disbelieved by a
jury.” Taylor Estate, 329 Mich App at 285.
4.5 Gang-Related Crimes–Expert Testimony
A. General Standards Regarding Relevancy and “Assisting
the Trier of Fact”
“As a threshold matter, applying MRE 402 and MRE 702 requires a
trial court to act as a gatekeeper of gang-related expert testimony
and determine whether that testimony is relevant and will assist the
trier of fact to understand the evidence.” People v Bynum, 496 Mic h
610, 625 (2014). “[F]act evidence to show that the crime at issue i s
gang-related provides a sufficient basis for a trial court to conclude
26 This informal approach to discovery is not contrary to the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA). Holman v Rasak, 486 Mich 429, 446 (2010). The Michigan Supreme Court
stated that “[a]n ex parte interview may be conducted and a covered entity may disclose protected healt h
information during the interview in a manner that is consistent with HIPAA, as long as ‘[t]he covered entit y
receives satisfactory assurance . . . that reasonable efforts have been made . . . to secure a qualifie d
protective order that meets the requirements of [45 CFR 164.512(e)(1)(v)].’” Holman, 486 Mich at 446,
quoting 45 CFR 164.512(e)(1)(ii)(B).
Page 4-70 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.5
that expert testimony regarding gangs is relevant and will be
helpful to the jury, although the significance of fact evidence and it s
relationship to gang violence can be gleaned from expert testimony.
Id. at 629.
“The introduction of evidence regarding a defendant’s gang
membership is relevant and can ‘assist the trier of fact to understand
the evidence’ when there is fact evidence that the crime at issue i s
gang-related.” Bynum, 496 Mich at 625-626, quoting MRE 702.
B. Permissible Testimony
This subsection discusses only permissible testimony; for a
discussion on limitations on gang-related expert testimony, see
Section 4.5(C).
1. Underlying Fact Evidence
“Ordinarily, expert testimony about gang membership is o f
little value to a fact-finder unless there is a connection betwee n
gang membership and the crime at issue.” People v Bynum, 49 6
Mich 610, 626 (2014). “Accordingly, the relevance of gang-
related expert testimony may be satisfied by fact evidence that,
at first glance, may not indicate gang motivations, but whe n
coupled with expert testimony, provides the gang-crim e
connection.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Sometimes . . . identifying whether a crime is gang-relate d
requires an expert to establish the significance of seemingl y
innocuous matters–such as clothing, symbolism, and tattoos–
as features of gang membership and gang involvement. ”
Bynum, 496 Mich at 626. “At other times, an expert’s testimon y
that the crime was committed in rival gang territory may b e
necessary to show why the defendant’s presence in that area, a
fact established by other evidence, was motivated by his gan g
affiliation.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Bynum, the Court held that “the location of the crimes [(o n
disputed gang territory)], when combined with evidence tha t
multiple gang members were involved in the crimes, provided
sufficient fact evidence to conclude that expert testimon y
regarding gangs, gang membership, and gang culture would
be relevant and helpful to the jury in this case.” Bynum, 49 6
Mich at 630.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-71
Section 4.5 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
2. Expert Testimony to Establish Motive
Establishing a gang member’s motive for committing a gang-
related crime is an appropriate purpose for which exper t
testimony may be admitted. People v Bynum, 496 Mich 610, 630
(2014). Accordingly, “a gang expert may testify that a gang, i n
general, protects its turf through violence as an explanation fo r
why a gang member might be willing to commit apparen t
random acts of violence against people the gang membe r
believes pose a threat to that turf.” Id.
C. Limitations on Expert Testimony
27
MRE 404(a)(1) “limits the extent to which a witness may opine
about a defendant’s gang membership.” People v Bynum, 496 Mic h
610, 627 (2014). “[A]n expert may not testify that, on a particular
occasion, a gang member acted in conformity with character trait s
commonly associated with gang members. Such testimony would
attempt to prove a defendant’s conduct simply because he or she is a
gang member.” Id. However, gang-related evidence could b e
admissible if it is used for a nonconformity purpose, such a s
proving motive, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. People v
Smith, 336 Mich App 79, 113 (2021); MRE 404(b) (noting “[i]n a
murder case, proof of motive is always relevant, even if not alway s
necessary”).
The expert in Bynum “veered into objectionable territory when he
opined that [the defendant] had acted in conformity with his gang
membership with regard to the specific crimes in question.” Bynum,
496 Mich at 630-631. Specifically, the expert’s testimony describing
the character traits associated with gang membership to interpret a
surveillance video improperly suggested the defendant’s guilt. Id. at
631. The expert testified that when he viewed the video, he saw the
gang members, including the defendant “all posted up at the store
with a purpose. When they went to that store that day, they didn’ t
know who they were going to beat up or shoot, but they went up
there waiting for someone to give them the chance. ‘Make us – give
me a reason to – to shoot [you], to fight you, to show how tough we
are, the Boardman Boys, on our turf.’” Id. (alteration in original).
The Court held that “[i]n contrast to his otherwise admissible
general testimony about aspects of gang culture, [the expert’s]
testimony interpreting the video evidence specifically connected
those character traits to [the defendant’s] conduct in a particular
circumstance. Such testimony impermissibly attempted to ‘prov[e]
27 MRE 404(a)(1) provides “[e]vidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible to prov e
that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait” unless one of th e
enumerated exceptions apply. See Section 2.3 for more information on MRE 404(a).
Page 4-72 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.6
action in conformity’ with character traits common to all gang
members on a particular occasion. As a result, this testimony
violated MRE 404(a).” Bynum, 496 Mich at 631.
Gang-related testimony is also subject to MRE 403, which require s
the trial court to determine whether the danger of unfair prejudice
to the defendant substantially outweighs the probative value of the
evidence. Bynum, 496 Mich at 635 n 43.
Committee Tip:
The distinction between acceptable and
improper gang expert testimony often becomes
muddled. Be on guard for its impermissible use
as conformity evidence under MRE 404(a).
4.6 Standardized Field Sobriety Tests–Expert Testimony
“A person who is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, o r
education, in the administration of standardized field sobriety tests,
including the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, shall be allowed t o
testify subject to showing of a proper foundation of qualifications. Thi s
section does not preclude the admissibility of a nonstandardized field
sobriety test if it complies with the Michigan rules of evidence.” MCL
257.625s. See Section 4.6(B)(4) for additional information about polic e
officer testimony regarding field sobriety tests.
4.7 Drug Recognition Evaluator or Expert Testimony
Drug Recognition Evaluator or Expert (DRE) testimony is no t
automatically admissible, and the trial court must still make a
determination whether a DRE officer is qualified to offer exper t
testimony. See People v Bowden, 344 Mich App 171, 175 n 2 (2022) (notin g
that even if a person’s “certification designates him to be a dru g
recognition ‘expert,’ that label has no bearing on whether he ma y
properly testify as an expert for purposes of MRE 702”). In Bowden, “th e
prosecution filed a motion in the district court requesting the court t o
‘declare [a deputy involved in the traffic stop with the defendant] a n
expert in the field of Drug Evaluation and Classification and be allowe d
to testify, and provide an expert opinion, as a [DRE].’” Id. at 177 (th e
defendant was charged with operating while intoxicated on the basis o f
marijuana use). However, “the prosecution did not present any evidenc e
in the district court to show that the DRE protocol had been validated a s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-73
Section 4.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
a reliable method for demonstrating a person’s level of impairment due t o
marijuana or the degree to which a person’s driving abilities could be
diminished by any given level of marijuana.” Id. at 189. Although th e
“studies on which the prosecution relied demonstrated the DRE
protocol’s level of accuracy with respect to determining whether a
particular type of substance was present in a person’s blood,” “neither o f
the submitted reports purported to even address the question of ho w
particular levels of marijuana impacted a person’s ability to drive o r
rendered a person ‘impaired.’” Id. at 189. Accordingly, the Court
concluded that “the determination under the DRE protocol that a perso n
is ‘impaired’ and unable to safely drive a car appears to be ultimatel y
based on the DRE officer’s subjective judgment, and there is no evidenc e
in this record that the ability of a person to make such a judgment based
on the application of the DRE protocol has been tested to demonstrate th e
accuracy and validity of reaching such a conclusion on a person’s level o f
impairment due to marijuana.” Id. at 189. The Bowden Court noted tha t
the “prosecution did not present any evidence that the DRE protocol ha s
been tested, or has a known error rate, with respect to the purpose for whic h
the prosecution intended to use the results of the protocol in this case—to provide
evidence of defendant’s level of impairment and impaired driving ability.” Id. at
190. The Court commented that there was simply no evidence “t o
support that the DRE protocol [could] reliably be used to detect th e
degree or level of intoxication caused by marijuana and determin e
whether that level of intoxication has made the person unable to safel y
drive a motor vehicle.” Id. at 191. Because the prosecution “failed t o
establish any valid connection between the use of the DRE protocol and a
conclusion regarding the degree to which a person’s driving ability wa s
diminished by the use of marijuana,” the Bowden Court held that “the
prosecution failed to meet its burden to establish the reliability, and thu s
the admissibility, of the proposed expert testimony.” Id. at 191.
4.8 Police Officer as Witness
A. Lay Opinion Testimony
As with any lay witness, a police officer may be able to give opinio n
testimony under MRE 701. “[A]ny witness is qualified to testify as
to his or her physical observations and opinions formed as a resul t
of these observations.” People v Grisham, 125 Mich App 280, 28 6
(1983).
1. Examples
a. Cell Phone Data
An investigating detective’s “opinion testimony that the
telephone records showed evidence of huma n
Page 4-74 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.8
trafficking” was admissible under MRE 701 because “the
detective’s testimony was rationally based on his personal
review of the records[.]” People v Thurmond, 348 Mich App
715, 733 (2023).
b. Identification on Surveillance Video
“[T]he trial court abused its discretion when it allowed [a
police officer testifying as a lay witness] to identify [the
defendant] in a surveillance video,” because thi s
“testimony invaded the province of the jury”; althoug h
the officer “could properly comment that, based on hi s
experience, the individual appeared to be concealing a
weapon,” the officer “should not have been allowed t o
identify [the defendant] as that individual” where
“[t]here was nothing about the images (i.e. poor quality of
the images, defendant wearing a disguise) tha t
necessitated [the officer’s] opinion.” People v Perkins, 31 4
Mich App 140, 160-162 (2016) (ultimately concluding tha t
“the error was harmless”), vacated in part on other
grounds by unpublished order of the Court of Appeals,
entered February 12, 2016 (Docket Nos. 323454, 323876,
28
and 325741).
Contrast with People v Fomby, 300 Mich App 46, 53 (2013),
where a police officer certified as a forensic vide o
technician was permitted to give opinion testimony under
MRE 701 linking “individuals depicted in [a] surveillanc e
video as being the same individuals depicted in . . . still
photographs” because his testimony was rationally based
on his perception of the evidence and because it wa s
helpful to the jury in evaluating the evidence to determine
a fact at issue in the case. The officer’s opinion testimony
“did not invade the province of the jury” because he “did
not identify defendant in the video or still images.”
Fomby, 300 Mich App at 53.
c. Seatbelt
A police officer was permitted to give opinion testimony
under MRE 701 that a plaintiff was not wearing a seat bel t
at the time of an automobile accident “because hi s
testimony was based on his perceptions at the scene of the
accident.” Chastain v Gen Motors Corp (On Remand), 25 4
Mich App 576, 588 (2002).

note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-75
Section 4.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
d. Cause of Accident
Two police officers’ opinion testimony as to the cause of
an accident was inadmissible where the officers did no t
see the accident and based their conclusions solely upo n
witness statements taken after the accident. Miller v
Hensley, 244 Mich App 528, 531 (2001) (“[b]ecause the
officers’ testimony that plaintiff was at fault for the
collision was not rationally based on their ow n
perceptions, the testimony was not admissible under
MRE 701”).
e. Damage Caused by Bullets
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by accepting
opinion testimony from police officers that a car had bee n
dented by bullets because “the officers’ testimony . . . wa s
[not] dependent upon scientific, technical or other
specialized knowledge[.]” People v Oliver, 170 Mich App
38, 50-51 (1988), modified in part on other grounds 43 3
Mich 862 (1989).
f. Visible Intoxication
Two police officers were permitted to give opinio n
testimony that the defendant was visibly intoxicated.
Heyler v Dixon, 160 Mich App 130, 148-149 (1987).
g. Concealment by Defendant
A police officer was permitted to give opinion testimony
that the defendant was trying to conceal himself. People v
Smith, 152 Mich App 756, 764 (1986) (the officer’ s
testimony “that when he first spotted the defendant and
his accomplice they were standing ‘up against the
house . . . trying to conceal themselves from the street or
any vehicular traffic’ . . . was clearly based on th e
witness’s perception and involved a crucial issue, whether
defendant was the victim of a crime or a culprit”).
2. Jury Instruction
In a criminal case, a party may request the court to issue a jur y
instruction pursuant to M Crim JI 5.11, which indicates that th e
police officer’s testimony is to be judged by the same standard s
used to evaluate the testimony of any other lay witness.
Page 4-76 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.8
B. Expert Testimony
1. Blood Stain Interpretation
A police detective may be permitted to provide exper t
testimony regarding blood stain interpretation. People v
Haywood, 209 Mich App 217, 224-225 (1995). In Haywood, th e
police officer “was clearly qualified by knowledge, experience,
and training to testify regarding the bloodstains found i n
defendant’s apartment. He had received over one hundre d
hours of training in bloodstain analysis and attended fiv e
different seminars. Further, he had utilized that training i n
approximately one hundred previous cases. Finally, [the polic e
officer] indicated that he was familiar with the literature on th e
subject and [taught] a course on bloodstain interpretation t o
other law enforcement officers.” Id. at 225.
2. Delayed Disclosure
“‘Delayed disclosure’ refers to sex abuse victims, includin g
children, not immediately informing others of the abuse tha t
transpired.” People v Dobek, 274 Mich App 58, 76 n 8 (2007). I n
Dobek, the Court of Appeals concluded that a detectiv e
possessed the requisite knowledge, training, experience, and
education concerning the sexual abuse of children to b e
considered an expert capable of testifying about delaye d
disclosure in sex abuse victims. Id. at 79.
3. Drug Dealing or Activity
Qualified police officers may testify as experts in controlled
substance cases. People v Murray, 234 Mich App 46, 53 (1999).
For an officer’s expert testimony to be admissible, “‘(1) th e
expert must be qualified; (2) the evidence must serve to giv e
the trier of fact a better understanding of the evidence or assis t
in determining a fact in issue; and (3) the evidence must b e
from a recognized discipline.’” Id., quoting People v Williams
(After Remand), 198 Mich App 537, 541 (1993).
Police expert testimony regarding drug profiles is admissible,
but only to the extent that the testimony does “not mov e
beyond an explanation of the typical characteristics of dru g
dealing[.]” Murray, 234 Mich App at 54. A limiting instruction
to the jury is appropriate. See id. at 60-61. M Crim JI 4.17
provides such an instruction on the use of drug profil e
evidence.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-77
Section 4.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“Drug profile evidence” is “an informal compilation o f
characteristics often displayed by those trafficking in drugs. ”
People v Hines, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). “[D]rug profile evidence is generall y
inadmissible as substantive evidence of guilt, but trial court s
may admit it to explain the significance of other evidence.” Id.
at ___. However, “there is often a very fine line between th e
probative use of profile evidence as background or modu s
operandi evidence and its prejudicial use as substantiv e
evidence.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Trial courts therefore mus t
make a case-by-case determination to allow drug profil e
testimony that aids the jury in intelligently understanding th e
evidentiary backdrop of the case, and the modus operandi o f
drug dealers, but stop short of enabling profile testimony tha t
purports to comment directly or substantively on a defendant’ s
guilt.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). The
following “four nonexhaustive factors” are relevant to thi s
analysis:
(1) “the drug-profile evidence must be offered as
background or modus operandi evidence, and no t
as substantive evidence of guilt, and the distinctio n
must be carefully maintained by the attorneys an d
the court.”
(2) “something more than drug profile evidenc e
must be admitted to prove a defendant’s guilt;
multiple pieces of profile do not add up to guil t
without something more.”
(3) “the trial court must make clear to the jury wha t
is and is not an appropriate use of the drug-profile
evidence by, e.g., instructing the jury that drug-
profile evidence is properly used only as
background or modus operandi evidence and
should not be used as substantive evidence of
guilt.”
(4) “the expert witness should not be permitted t o
express an opinion that, on the basis of the profile,
defendant is guilty, and should not expressl y
compare the defendant’s characteristics to the
profile in a way that implies that the defendant i s
guilty.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
In Hines, two police officers, who were “previously assigned t o
the drug task force, testified about common features and
methods of drug trafficking and drug use.” Id. at ___. “Both
Page 4-78 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.8
witnesses provided permissible drug profile testimony and
testimony that crossed the line into impermissible comment s
on [defendant’s] guilt.” Id. at ___ (“[B]oth came close t o
crossing the line into opining on [defendant’s] guilt or making
direct comparisons between [defendant’s] conduct and thei r
stated ‘drug profile’ conduct.”). One drug-profile evidenc e
expert “testified that the police did not find pipes, needles, or
items associated with drug use (as opposed to trafficking)
during the search of [defendant’s] residence”; the expert “als o
vaguely opined that the quantity of drugs [defendant] had wa s
not indicative of personal use.” Id. at ___ (“This likely crosse d
the line into opinion testimony because it directly linked
general characteristics to the evidence identified in this case.”).
The other expert “opined that the 31 bindles of fentanyl
recovered from [defendant] were indicative of packaging fo r
delivery because of the number.” Id. at ___ (“This wa s
inadmissible because it was essentially an opinion of
[defendant’s] guilt.”). “Likewise, his comment that a user
might purchase more than one bindle but ‘you’re very rarely
gonna comma across users with 30 packets, 31 packets’ was
impermissible.” Id. at ___ (“It linked common traits directly t o
the facts of this case.”). “Finally, [the expert] speculated on why
[defendant] might not have money with him suggesting tha t
he ‘recently re-upped.’” Id. at ___ (“This too wa s
impermissible.”). “It is difficult to say that the impermissible
drug profile evidence made a difference.” Id. at ___ (finding “i t
arguably made explicit connections a reasonable jury would
have already made”). “Considering the total body of
evidence,” the Hines Court concluded that defendant could not
establish “that but for the impermissible testimony, the trial
would have had a different result.” Id. at ___.
4. Field Sobriety Tests
A police officer may testify as an expert about the results o f
field sobriety tests if the “evidence indicate[s] that the office r
possess[es] knowledge, training, and experience regarding th e
field sobriety tests at issue.” People v Peebles, 216 Mich App 661,
667-668 (1996) (the officer was qualified to testify where “h e
had been a police officer for one year and seven months at th e
time of the stop . . . and he had received four or five hours o f
training on the field tests at issue and had received on-the-jo b
training regarding such tests”).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-79
Section 4.8 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
5. Firearms
A police officer who had fired sawed-off shotguns wa s
qualified as an expert to testify about their recoil
characteristics. People v Douglas, 65 Mich App 107, 117 (1975).
6. Operation of Motor Vehicles
An officer was qualified to testify as an expert about th e
defendant’s estimated speed at the time of an accident wher e
his training “consisted of four days in an unspecified school
and six months work with experienced officers.” People v
Ebejer, 66 Mich App 333, 340-343 (1976). Additionally, “the dat a
upon which [the officer’s] opinion was based was sufficient t o
support the admissibility of the testimony.” Id. at 342-343
(within an hour or so of the accident, the officer made variou s
measurements and examined skid marks, gouge marks,
scratches, and photographs he had taken at the scene).
A police officer may give an expert opinion whether a tractor-
trailer was properly loaded. Jenkins v Raleigh Trucking Servs, Inc,
187 Mich App 424, 429-430 (1991) (noting “defendants offere d
expert testimony to the contrary”).
7. Self-Defense
A testifying detective’s “expertise did not extend to offering a
profile of the ‘certain way’ in which those who kill in self-
defense act during interrogations,” and “the trial court’ s
decision to admit [the detective’s] expert testimony in [that ]
regard fell beyond the range of principled outcomes”; th e
detective’s participation in an unidentified number of previou s
cases in which individuals claimed to have acted in self-
defense did not “qualif[y] him to offer expert opinion s
regarding whether individuals act a ‘certain way’ after killin g
in self-defense as well as whether defendant’s behavior . . . wa s
consistent with that ‘certain way.’” People v Dixon-Bey, 321 Mic h
App 490, 505 (2017). The detective’s “expertise was in the are a
of interpreting evidence at homicide investigations, not i n
psychology or some other behavioral science,” and while a n
officer “need not necessarily be a psychologist to offer this typ e
of testimony, it is equally true that he does need to have th e
requisite knowledge, skill, experience, training, and educatio n
to be qualified as an expert in the area about which he i s
offering expert testimony[.]” Id. at 505, 509 (further concluding
that the error was not outcome determinative).

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.9
Committee Tip:
Care should be taken in evaluating the
admissibility of expert testimony fro m
traditional fields of expertise.
C. Testimony About Defendant’s Statement
MCL 763.8(2) provides that “[a] law enforcement official
interrogating an individual in custodial detention regarding th e
individual’s involvement in the commission of a major felony shal l
make a time-stamped, audiovisual recording of the entire
[29]
interrogation. A major felony recording shall include the law
enforcement official’s notification to the individual of the
[30]
individual’s Miranda rights.” MCL 763.8(2).
However, “[a]ny failure to record a statement as required under
[MCL 763.8] or to preserve a recorded statement does not preven t
any law enforcement official present during the taking of the
statement from testifying in court as to the circumstances and
content of the individual’s statement if the court determines that the
31
statement is otherwise admissible.” MCL 763.9.
4.9 Forensic Laboratory Reports and Certificates
MCR 6.202 concerns forensic laboratory reports and certificates, and
applies to criminal trials in district and circuit court. MCR 6.202(A).
A. Disclosure of Report
“Upon receipt of a forensic laboratory report and certificate, if
applicable, by the examining expert, the prosecutor shall serve a
copy of the laboratory report and certificate on the opposing party’ s
attorney or party, if not represented by an attorney, within 14 day s
29MCL 763.8 “applies if the law enforcement agency has audiovisual recording equipment that is
operational or accessible as provided in [MCL 763.11(3) or MCL 763.11(4)] or upon the expiration of th e
relevant time periods set forth in [MCL 763.11(3) or MCL 763.11(4)], whichever occurs first.” MCL 763.8(1).
30Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
31“[U]nless the individual objected to having the interrogation recorded and that objection was properly
documented under [MCL 763.8(3)], the jury shall be instructed that it is the law of this state to recor d
statements of an individual in custodial detention who is under interrogation for a major felony and that
the jury may consider the absence of a recording in evaluating the evidence relating to the individual’ s
statement.” MCL 763.9.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-81
Section 4.9 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
after receipt of the laboratory report and certificate.” MCR 6.202(B).
Additionally, the prosecutor must file with the court “proof of
service of the report and certificate, if applicable, on the opposing
party’s attorney or party, if not represented by an attorney[.]” MCR
6.202(B).
B. Notice
If a party intends to offer a forensic laboratory report as evidence a t
trial, the party’s attorney (or party, if not represented by a n
attorney), must provide the opposing party’s attorney (or party, if
not represented by an attorney), with written notice of that fact.
MCR 6.202(C)(1). If the prosecuting attorney intends to offer a
forensic laboratory report as evidence at trial, notice to defense
counsel (or the defendant, if not represented by counsel), must be
included with the report. Id. If a defendant intends to offer a
forensic laboratory report as evidence at trial, notice to the
prosecuting attorney must be provided within 14 days after
receiving the report. Id. “Except as provided in [MCR 6.202(C)(2)],
the report and certification, if applicable, is admissible in evidence
to the same effect as if the person who performed the analysis or
examination had personally testified.” MCR 6.202(C)(1).
C. Demand
After receiving a copy of the forensic laboratory report and
certificate (if applicable), the opposing party’s attorney (or party, if
not represented by an attorney), may file a written objection to the
use of the forensic laboratory report and certificate. MCR
6.202(C)(2). The written objection must be filed with the court wher e
the matter is pending, and must be served on the opposing party’ s
attorney (or party, if not represented by an attorney), within 14 day s
of receiving the notice. Id. If a written objection is filed, the forensi c
laboratory report and certificate are inadmissible under MCR
6.202(C)(1). If no objection is made to the use of the forensi c
laboratory report and certificate within 14 days of receipt of the
notice, the forensic laboratory report and certificate are admissible
in evidence as set out in MCR 6.202(C)(1). MCR 6.202(C)(2). Th e
court must extend the time period of filing a written objection for
good cause. MCR 6.202(C)(3). Compliance with MCR 6.202, such a s
extending the time period for filing a written objection for good
cause, also constitutes good cause for adjourning trial. MCR
6.202(C)(4).
Page 4-82 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.10
D. Certification
The analyst who conducted the analysis on the forensic sample and
signed the report must complete a certificate on which he or she
must state (1) that he or she is qualified by education, training, and
experience to perform the analysis; (2) the name and location of the
laboratory where the analysis was performed; (3) that performing
the analysis is part of his or her regular duties; and (4) that the test s
were performed under industry-approved procedures or standard s
and the report accurately reflects the analyst’s findings and opinion s
regarding the results of those tests or analysis. MCR 6.202(D).
Alternatively, a report submitted by an analyst employed by a
laboratory that is accredited by a national or international
accreditation entity that substantially meets the certificatio n
requirements set out in the court rule may provide proof of the
laboratory’s accreditation certificate in lieu of a separate certificate.
Id.
4.10 Fingerprints
“Fingerprints are a matter of identification, not incrimination.” People v
Cooper, 220 Mich App 368, 375 (1996). The fingerprints themselves are the
evidence, not the object on which they are found. People v Cullens, 5 5
Mich App 272, 274-275 (1974).
Provided they are properly authenticated under MRE 901, fingerprin t
cards bearing a defendant’s fingerprints collected during an investigatio n
at a time in which the defendant was not yet a suspect in the crime ma y
be admissible as a business record or a public record under MRE 803(6)
32
and MRE 803(8), respectively. People v Jambor (On Remand), 273 Mic h
App 477, 481-486 (2007).
Jury Instruction. M Crim JI 4.15 should only be given where the sole
evidence of identity comes from fingerprints. See M Crim JI 4.15 us e
notes.
32 See Section 5.3(B)(6) on the business record hearsay exception, and Section 5.3(B)(8) on the public record hearsa y

Section 4.11 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
4.11 DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) Identification Profiling
33
System Act (DNA Profiling Act)
A. Summary of Content of the Act
The DNA Profiling Act requires the department of state police t o
promulgate rules pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act t o
implement the DNA Profiling Act. MCL 28.173.
Under MCL 28.173, the department must promulgate rules t o
govern the following issues:
“(a) The method of collecting samples in a medically
approved manner by qualified persons and the type s
and number of samples to be collected by the following:
(i) The department of corrections from certai n
prisoners under . . . MCL 791.233d.
(ii) Law enforcement agencies as provided
under . . . MCL 750.520m, or certain juvenile s
under . . . MCL 712A.18k.
(iii) The department of [health and] huma n
services or a county juvenile agency, as applicable,
from certain juveniles under . . . MCL 803.307a,
or . . . MCL 803.225a. As used in this paragraph,
‘county juvenile agency’ means that term a s
defined in . . . MCL 45.622.
(b) Distributing DNA database collection kits an d
instructions for collecting samples.
(c) Storing and transmitting to the department th e
samples described in subdivision (a).
(d) The DNA identification or genetic marker profiling
of samples described in subdivision (a).
(e) The development, in cooperation with the federa l
bureau of investigation and other appropriate persons,
of a system of filing, cataloging, retrieving, an d
comparing DNA identification profiles and
computerizing this system.
(f) Protecting the privacy interests of individuals whos e
samples are analyzed under this act.”
33 MCL 28.171 et seq.
Page 4-84 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.11
The department of state police may promulgate rules to implemen t
the DNA Identification Profiling System Act in addition to rule s
addressing the issues outlined in MCL 28.173.
B. Who Must Provide a Sample
The Michigan Penal Code requires a person to provide samples for
chemical testing for DNA identification profiling or genetic marker s
if any of the following apply:
• The person is arrested for committing or attempting t o
commit a felony offense or an offense that would be a
felony if committed by an adult. MCL 750.520m(1)(a).
• The person is convicted of, or found responsible for, a
felony or attempted felony, or any of the following
misdemeanors or local ordinances substantially
corresponding to the misdemeanors:
• MCL 750.167(1)(c) (disorderly person—window
peeping);
• MCL 750.167(1)(f) (disorderly person—indecent/
obscene conduct in public);
• MCL 750.167(1)(i) (disorderly person—loitering in
house of ill fame or prostitution);
• MCL 750.335a(1) (indecent exposure);
• MCL 750.451(1) or MCL 750.450(2) (first and second
prostitution violations);
• MCL 750.454 (leasing a house for purposes of
prostitution). MCL 750.520m(1)(b)(i)-(iv).
C. Collecting a Sample of an Individual’s DNA
1. Collection and Forwarding of Samples
“The county sheriff or the investigating law enforcemen t
agency as ordered by the court shall provide for collecting th e
samples required to be provided under [MCL 28.176(1)] in a
medically approved manner by qualified persons usin g
supplies provided by the department and shall forward thos e
samples and any samples described in [MCL 28.176(1)] tha t
were already in the agency’s possession to the department afte r
the individual from whom the sample was taken has bee n
arraigned in the district court. However, the individual’s DN A
sample must not be forwarded to the department if th e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-85
Section 4.11 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
individual is not charged with committing or attempting t o
commit a felony offense or an offense that would be a felony i f
committed by an adult. If the individual’s DNA sample i s
forwarded to the department despite the individual not havin g
been charged as described in this subsection, the la w
enforcement agency shall notify the department to destroy tha t
sample. The collecting and forwarding of samples must b e
done in the manner required under [the DNA Profiling Act]. A
sample must be collected by the county sheriff or th e
investigating law enforcement agency after arrest but befor e
sentencing or disposition as ordered by the court and
promptly transmitted to the department of state police afte r
the individual is charged with committing or attempting t o
commit a felony offense or an offense that would be a felony i f
committed by an adult. [MCL 28.176(4)] does not preclude a
law enforcement agency or state agency from obtaining a
sample at or after sentencing or disposition.” MCL 28.176(4).
See also MCL 750.520m(3) and MCL 750.520m(4).
2. Required Notice
“At the time a DNA sample is taken form an individual unde r
[MCL 28.176], the individual must be notified in writing of al l
of the following:
(a) That, except as otherwise provided by law, the
individual’s DNA sample or DNA identificatio n
profile, or both, must be destroyed or expunged, as
appropriate, if the charge for which the sample
was obtained has been dismissed or resulted i n
acquittal, or no charge was filed within the
limitations period.
(b) That the individual’s DNA sample or DNA
identification profile, or both, will not be destroyed
or expunged, as appropriate, if the department
determines that the individual from whom the
sample is taken is otherwise obligated to submit a
sample or if it is evidence relating to another
individual that would otherwise be retained under
this section.
(c) That the burden is on the arresting law
enforcement agency and the prosecution to reques t
the destruction or expunction of a DNA sample or
DNA identification profile as required under
[MCL 28.176], not on the individual.” MCL
28.176(4)(a)-(c).
Page 4-86 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.11
D. Constitutional Issues
The United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality
of a state statute authorizing the collection and analysis of a n
arrestee’s DNA according to national Combined DNA Index Syste m
34
(CODIS) procedures “[a]s part of a routine booking procedure for
serious offenses[.]” Maryland v King, 569 US 435, 440-441 (2013).
“When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold
for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be
detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the
arrestee’s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a
legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the
Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 465-466. See the Michigan Judicial
Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 1, Chapter 11, for
discussion of Fourth Amendment search and seizure issues.
E. Individual’s Refusal to Provide Sample
If an individual who is required by law to provide a sample for
DNA identification profiling refuses or resists providing a sample,
he or she must be advised that the refusal or resistance is a
misdemeanor offense punishable by not more than one year of
imprisonment, or a maximum fine of $1,000, or both. MCL
28.173a(1).
“If at the time an individual who is required by law to provide
samples for DNA identification profiling is arrested for committing
or attempting to commit a felony offense or is convicted or foun d
responsible the investigating law enforcement agency or th e
department already has a sample from the individual that meets the
requirements of the rules promulgated under this act, the individual
is not required to provide another sample. However, if a n
individual’s DNA sample is inadequate for purposes of analysis, the
individual shall provide another DNA sample that is adequate for
35
analysis.” MCL 28.173a(2). See also MCL 28.176(3).
F. Cooperative Agencies and Individuals
“The department of state police shall work with the federal burea u
of investigation and other appropriate persons to develop the
capability of conducting DNA identification and genetic marker
34 The Michigan’s DNA Identification Profiling System Act, MCL 28.171 et seq., is part of CODIS, which link s
together existing state DNA databases. The CODIS unit manages the Combined DNA Index System and th e
National DNA System (NDIS). For detailed information about these databases, see the FBI’s Frequently
Asked Questions on CODIS. The link to this resource was created using Perma.cc and directs the reader to

profiling at department of state police crime laboratories. For thi s
purpose, the department shall acquire, adapt, or construct th e
appropriate facilities, acquire the necessary equipment and
supplies, evaluate and select analytic techniques and validate the
chosen techniques, and obtain training for department of state
police personnel.” MCL 28.174.
G. Permissible Use of DNA Information
According to MCL 28.175a(1)(a)-(c), the department’s use of th e
DNA profile information is limited to any or all of the following
purposes:
• Identification for law enforcement purposes.
• Assistance with the recovery or identification of missing
persons or human remains.
• If personal identifiers are removed, for academic, research,
statistical analysis, or protocol development purposes.
H. Impermissible Use of DNA Information
DNA samples provided under the DNA Profiling Act must not be
analyzed to identify any medical or genetic disorder. MCL
28.175a(2).
The DNA Profiling Act specifically prohibits several actions:
“(1) An individual shall not disseminate, receive, o r
otherwise use or attempt to use information in the DNA
identification profile record knowing that th e
dissemination, receipt, or use of that information is for a
purpose not authorized by law.
(2) An individual shall not willfully remove, destroy,
tamper with, or attempt to tamper with a DNA sample,
record, or other DNA information obtained or retaine d
under [the DNA Profiling Act] without lawful authority.
(3) An individual shall not, without proper authority,
obtain a DNA identification profile from the DNA
identification profiling system.
(4) An individual shall not, without proper authority,
test a DNA sample obtained under [the DNA Profilin g
Act].
(5) An individual shall not willfully fail to destroy a
DNA sample or profile that has been required o r
Page 4-88 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.11
ordered to be destroyed under [the DNA Profilin g
Act].” MCL 28.175(1)-(5).
Violation of MCL 28.175 is a misdemeanor punishable b y
imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine of not more tha n
$1,000, or both. MCL 28.175(7).
“Nothing in [MCL 28.175] shall be considered to prohibit the
collection of a DNA sample in the course of a criminal investigatio n
by a law enforcement agency.” MCL 28.175(6).
I. Permanent Retention of DNA Profile
“Except as otherwise provided in [MCL 28.176], the departmen t
shall permanently retain a DNA identification profile of an
individual obtained from a sample in the manner prescribed by the
department under [the DNA Profiling Act] if any of the following
apply:
(a) The individual is arrested for committing o r
attempting to commit a felony offense or an offense tha t
would be a felony offense if committed by an adult.
(b) The individual is convicted of or found responsibl e
for a felony or attempted felony, or any of the followin g
misdemeanors, or local ordinances that are substantiall y
corresponding to the following misdemeanors:
(i) A violation of [MCL 750.167(1)(c), MCL
750.167(1)(f), or MCL 750.167(1)(i)] . . . , disorderly
person by window peeping, engaging in indecen t
or obscene conduct in public, or loitering in a
house of ill fame or prostitution.
(ii) A violation of [MCL 750.335a(1)] . . . , indecen t
exposure.
(iii) A violation punishable under [MCL 750.451(1)
or MCL 750.451(2)] . . . ,first and secon d
prostitution violations.
(iv) A violation of . . . MCL 750.454, leasing a hous e
for purposes of prostitution.” MCL 28.176(1).
J. Disclosure Permitted
“The DNA identification profiles of DNA samples received under
[the DNA Profiling Act] must only be disclosed as follows:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-89
Section 4.11 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(a) To a criminal justice agency for law enforcemen t
identification purposes.
(b) In a judicial proceeding as authorized or required b y
a court.
(c) To a defendant in a criminal case if the DN A
identification profile is used in conjunction with a
charge against the defendant.
(d) For an academic, research, statistical analysis, o r
protocol developmental purpose only if personal
identifications are removed.” MCL 28.176(2).
K. DNA Sample Already Taken
“Notwithstanding [MCL 28.176(1)], if at the time the individual i s
arrested, convicted of, or found responsible for the violation the
investigating law enforcement agency or the department already
has a sample from the individual that meets the requirements o f
[the DNA Profiling Act], the individual is not required to provide
another sample or pay the assessment required under [MCL
36
28.176(5)].” MCL 28.176(3). See also MCL 28.173a(2) (containing
substantially similar language but also requiring an individual t o
provide a subsequent sample if his or her previous sample wa s
inadequate for analysis purposes); MCL 750.520m(2) (containin g
substantially similar language).
L. Disposal of DNA Sample or Profile
1. Individual’s Charge(s) Dismissed Before Trial
MCL 764.26a states:
“(1) If an individual is arrested for any crime and
the charge or charges are dismissed before trial,
both of the following apply:
(a) The arrest record shall be removed fro m
the internet criminal history access too l
(ICHAT).
36 MCL 28.176(5) states: “The court shall order each individual found responsible for or convicted of 1 o r
more of the crimes listed in [MCL 28.176(1)] to pay an assessment of $60.00. The assessment required
under [MCL 28.176(5)] is in addition to any fine, costs, or other assessments imposed by the court. [MC L
28.176(5)] does not apply to a juvenile, or a parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a juvenile, within th e
jurisdiction of the court under [MCL 712A.2].” See also MCL 750.520m(5).
Page 4-90 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.11
(b) If the prosecutor of the case agrees at an y
time after the case is dismissed, or if th e
prosecutor of the case or the judge of th e
court in which the case was filed does no t
object within 60 days from the date an orde r
of dismissal was entered for cases in whic h
the order of dismissal is entered after [Jun e
12, 2018], all of the following apply:
(i) The arrest record, all biometric data ,
and fingerprints shall be expunged or
destroyed, or both, as appropriate.
(ii) Any entry concerning the charg e
shall be removed from LEIN.
(iii) Unless a DNA sample or profile, o r
both, is allowed or required to be
retained by the department of state
police under . . . MCL 28.176, the DNA
sample or profile, or both, obtained fro m
the individual shall be expunged or
destroyed.
(2) The department of state police shall comply
with the requirements listed in [MCL 764.26a(1)]
upon receipt of an appropriate order of the distric t
court or the circuit court.”
“MCL 28.176(1) provides that law enforcement shall
permanently retain a DNA identification profile of a n
individual obtained from a sample if the individual is arrested
for committing or attempting to commit a felony offense. ”
People v Cole, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up) .
“However, MCL 28.176(4)(a) provides that the individual’ s
DNA sample or DNA identification profile, or both, must b e
destroyed or expunged, as appropriate, if the charge for whic h
the sample was obtained has been dismissed or resulted i n
acquittal, or no charge was filed within the limitations period. ”
Cole, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks omitted).
“Likewise, MCL 28.176(10)(b) provides that the state polic e
forensic laboratory shall dispose of a DNA sample or profile o r
both when the charge for which the sample was obtained ha s
been dismissed or has resulted in an acquittal or that no charg e
was filed within the applicable limitations period.” Cole, __ _
Mich App at ___ (quotation marks omitted).
In Cole, “[d]efendant’s DNA sample was obtained because he
was arrested and charged with the felony of second-degre e
home invasion[.]” Id. at ___. “Defendant pleaded no contest t o
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-91
Section 4.11 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
lesser offenses that do not trigger DNA collection under MCL
28.176, and the home invasion charge was dismissed.” Cole, __ _
Mich App at ___. “The trial court determined . . . that eve n
though the felony charge against defendant that gave rise t o
the police collecting defendant’s DNA profile and sample ha d
been dismissed, the dismissal did not warrant destruction o f
his DNA profile and sample because defendant pleaded guilt y
to lesser offenses in lieu of the felony.” Id. at ___. However, th e
Cole Court held that MCL 28.176 “plainly states that DNA mus t
be destroyed when the charge for which the sample wa s
obtained has been dismissed.” Cole, ___ Mich App at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “MCL 28.176(4)(a) and
MCL 28.176(10)(b) specify that the dismissal refers to the
charge for which the sample was obtained, not the action o r
claim.” Cole, ___ Mich App at ___. MCL 28.176 “does not in any
way qualify the term ‘the charge for which the sample wa s
obtained’ or the term ‘dismissed.’” Cole, ___ Mich App at ___.
Instead, MCL 28.176 “requires the DNA profile and sample t o
be destroyed when the charge for which the sample wa s
obtained has been dismissed.” Cole, ___ Mich App at __ _
(holding that “the destruction of defendant’s DNA profile and
sample [was] mandated” because the dismissal fell “squarely
within the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutor y
language”).
2. Individual’s Conviction Is Reversed (Court Order
Required)
MCL 28.176(9) states:
“If a sample was collected under [MCL 28.176(1)]
from an individual who does not have more than 1
conviction, and that conviction was reversed by an
appellate court, the sentencing court shall order
the disposal of the sample collected and DNA
identification profile record for that conviction i n
the manner provided in [MCL 28.176(12) and MCL
28.176(13)].”
3. Samples or Profiles No Longer Necessary or
Individual Was Acquitted
Except for the DNA identification profiles required to be
retained permanently, any other DNA identification profil e
must not be permanently retained but “must be retained onl y
as long as it is needed for a criminal investigation or crimina l
prosecution.” MCL 28.176(10). Except as provided by MCL
28.176(11), a DNA sample or DNA identification profile mus t
Page 4-92 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.11
be disposed of by the state police forensic laboratory unde r
either of the following circumstances:
“(a) The department receives a written request for
disposal from the investigating police agency or
prosecutor indicating that the sample or profile i s
no longer necessary for a criminal investigation or
criminal prosecution.
(b) The department receives a written request for
disposal and a certified copy of a final court order
establishing that the charge for which the sample
was obtained has been dismissed or has resulted i n
an acquittal or that no charge was filed within the
applicable limitations period.” MCL 28.176(10).
The disposal requirements in MCL 28.176(10) do not apply if:
• “[T]he individual from whom the sample [wa]s take n
has otherwise become obligated to submit a sample.”
MCL 28.176(11)(a).
• Evidence that would otherwise be retained would be
destroyed because the sample from the individual
contains information or data relating to another
individual. MCL 28.176(15). See MCL 28.176(11)(b).
M. Method and Timing of Disposal
According to MCL 28.176(12):
“The state police forensic laboratory shall dispose of a
sample and a DNA identification profile record in th e
following manner:
(a) Not more than 60 days after the department
37
receives notice under [MCL 28.176(10) ], the
laboratory shall dispose of the sample i n
[38]
compliance with . . . MCL 333.13811.
(b) The laboratory shall dispose of the sample and
the DNA identification profile record in the
presence of a witness.”
37MCL 28.176(10) sets forth the circumstances under which the state police forensic laboratory mus t
dispose of a DNA sample and/or a DNA identification profile.
38 Provisions of the Public Health Code governing the storage, decontamination, and disposal of medical
waste.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-93
Section 4.12 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
After disposing of the sample and/or profile, the laboratory mus t
“make and keep a written record of the disposal, signed by the
individual who witnessed the disposal.” MCL 28.176(13).
N. Errors in Disposal, Retention, or Collection
According to MCL 28.176(14):
“An identification, warrant, detention, probable cause t o
arrest, arrest, or conviction based upon a DNA match or
DNA information is not invalidated if it is late r
determined that 1 or more of the following error s
occurred in good faith:
(a) A DNA sample was erroneously obtained.
(b) A DNA identification profile was erroneously
retained.
(c) A DNA sample was not disposed of or there
was a delay in disposing of the sample.
(d) A DNA identification profile was not disposed
of or there was a delay in disposing of the profile.”
4.12 DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) Testing and
39
Admissibility
“Absent a showing of suppression of evidence, intentional misconduct,
or bad faith, the prosecutor and the police are not required to tes t
evidence to accord a defendant due process.” People v Coy, 258 Mich Ap p
1, 21 (2003). Therefore, defendant’s general “complaint that polic e
conducted no forensic testing of the evidence was a matter for the jury t o
consider in its evaluation of the weight and strength of the evidence, bu t
it [did] not render the evidence presented insufficient to support [th e
defendant’s] convictions.” People v Savage, 327 Mich App 604, 615 (2019).
A. DNA Molecule Defined
“The [DNA] molecule is a double helix, shaped like a twisted
ladder. Phosphate and deoxyribose sugar form the rails of the
ladder. Four chemical bases—Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine
(G), and Thymine (T)—lie next to each other on the sugar link s
along the sides of the ladder. Each A always bonds with a T on the

this benchbook. For a discussion of DNA testing in Michigan, see https://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,4643,7-

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.12
other side of the ladder, and each C always bonds with a G on the
other side of the ladder, so that the possible base pairs on the ladder
are A-T, T-A, C-G, and G-C. The base pairs are connected by a
hydrogen bond, such that the bonds form the rungs of the ladder.
There are approximately three billion base pairs in one DNA
molecule. Although no two human beings have the same sequence
of base pairs (except for identical twins), we share many sequence s
that create common characteristics such as arms, legs, fingers, and
toes. The sequences of variation from person to person are known a s
polymorphisms. They contain different alleles, which are alternate
forms of a gene capable of occupying a single location on a
chromosome. Polymorphisms are the key to DNA identificatio n
because they create the individual characteristics of everyone and
are detectable in laboratory testing.”People v Adams, 195 Mich App
267, 270 (1992), modified and remanded on other grounds 441 Mich
40
916 (1993).
B. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
41
Mitochondrial DNA testing is admissible without a Davis-Frye
hearing. People v Holtzer, 255 Mich App 478, 488 (2003). The Holtzer
Court explained the differences between mtDNA and nuclear DNA:
“There are two types of DNA, nuclear DNA (nDNA )
and mitochondrial DNA [(mtDNA)]. Every cell of th e
body, except for red blood cells, contains both types o f
DNA. Nuclear DNA is the more commonly know n
variety, and is found in the nucleus of the cell. One-hal f
of an individual’s nuclear DNA comes from each parent.
Each nDNA molecule consists of approximately thre e
billion base pairs of nucleotides. Although over ninety-
nine percent of nuclear DNA is the same for all people,
every person, except for identical twins, has uniqu e
differences in his nuclear DNA. It is this uniqueness tha t
gives rise to its usefulness in forensic work.
Mitochondrial DNA, on the other hand, is found i n
small organelles called mitochondria, which are foun d
in every cell floating in the protoplasm. An mtDN A
molecule is significantly smaller than an nDN A
molecule, containing only about sixteen thousand bas e
pairs. It also differs from nDNA in that mtDNA i s
inherited solely from the mother. Accordingly, it can b e

41 The Davis-Frye test was derived from People v Davis, 343 Mich 348 (1955), and Frye v United States, 5 4
App DC 46 (1923).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-95
Section 4.12 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
used to establish a maternal lineage. Another differenc e
between nDNA and mtDNA is that nDNA is arrange d
in a long, double helix ‘twisted ladder’ formation whil e
mtDNA has a circular formation, like a twisted rubbe r
band. Furthermore, while each cell has only on e
nucleus, it may have thousands of copies o f
mitochondria, and each mitochondria has between tw o
and ten copies of mtDNA. Thus, while nDNA i s
significantly larger in size, mtDNA is present i n
significantly greater numbers. Additionally, mtDNA i s
more likely than nDNA to survive in a dead cell. Thus,
it is easier to recover useable mtDNA than usabl e
nDNA.” Holtzer, 255 Mich App at 481-482.
C. Methods of Testing DNA
Any question about whether laboratory procedures were properly
followed in testing DNA evidence presents an issue of weight, no t
admissibility, and is a question to be determined by the jury. People
Holtzer, 255 Mich App 478, 490 (2003).
1. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms
(RFLP) Method
42
DNA identification testing does not require a Davis-Frye
hearing for its admissibility because “DNA identificatio n
testing is generally accepted in the scientific community a s
reliable.” People v Adams, 195 Mich App 267, 277 (1992),
modified and remanded on other grounds 441 Mich 916
43
(1993) (DNA testing was performed using the RFLP method
on dried semen found on the victim’s blue jeans). Because o f
the overall acceptance of DNA testing in other jurisdictions, a
trial court may take judicial notice of DNA identificatio n
testing’s reliability. Adams, 195 Mich App at 277. However, th e
prosecution must show that the laboratory performing th e
DNA testing followed the generally accepted laborator y
procedures before the DNA test results are admitted int o
evidence. Id.

testing has been already established as accepted on th e
scientific community”).
2. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Method
44
A Davis-Frye hearing is not necessary to show the general
acceptance of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) DNA testin g
methods within the scientific community. People v Coy, 25 8
Mich App 1, 9-12 (2003).
DNA identification evidence using the PCR method wa s
properly admitted at trial because the method met the Davis-
Frye standard for admission. People v Lee, 212 Mich App 228,
281-282 (1995). As with People v Adams, 195 Mich App 267, 27 7
(1992), modified and remanded on other grounds 441 Mich 91 6
45
(1993) , before the DNA identification evidence is admitted,
the prosecution must show that the laboratory conducting th e
DNA test employed generally accepted procedures. Lee, 21 2
Mich App at 283. See also People v McMillan, 213 Mich App 134,
136-137 (1995) (DNA evidence obtained using the PCR metho d
was properly admitted at trial).
3. STRmix Probabilistic Genotype Method
“STRmix probabilistic genotype testing” is “a more recen t
form of DNA testing and a relatively new method o f
evaluating complex mixtures.” People v Muhammad, 326 Mich
App 40, 47 (2018). It “is a generally accepted method” of DN A
testing. Id. at 56. In Muhammad, “the trial court did not abus e
its discretion in concluding that the DNA evidenc e
[interpreted by using STRmix probabilistic genotype testin g
performed on the shoe of a robbery suspect] was admissibl e
46
under MRE 702.” Muhammad, 326 Mich App at 57. “STRmix
uses well-established mathematical and scientific methods and
. . . the software has undergone various validation studies, ”
including “manual calculations, true and false donor tests, and
tests against other software”; “STRmix has also been validate d
by four forensic laboratories in the United States and is bein g
validated by other laboratories”; and “STRmix [has been ]
subjected to peer review and approved for casework by th e
New York Commission on Forensic Science.” Id.
44 The Davis-Frye test was derived from People v Davis, 343 Mich 348 (1955), and Frye v United States, 5 4

testimony.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-97
Section 4.12 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
D. Statistical Interpretation Evidence of DNA Results
“Statistical evidence of DNA is generally admissible”; “statistics are
an integral part of DNA evidence and are necessary to assist the
trier of fact.” People v Coy (Coy II), 258 Mich App 1, 11 (2003). “Th e
results of DNA identification testing would be a matter of
speculation without the statistical analysis[.]” People v Adams, 195
Mich App 267, 279 (1992), modified and remanded on other
47
grounds 441 Mich 916 (1993). See also People v Coy (Coy I), 24 3
Mich App 283, 294 (2000) (finding that the evidence of a potential
match between a subject’s DNA sample and DNA found o n
evidence is “inadmissible absent some accompanying interpretive
evidence regarding the likelihood of the potential match”). “The Co y
standard requires that when DNA evidence is introduced, it mus t
be accompanied by some qualitative or quantitative interpretation.
The descriptive phrase, ‘to a reasonable degree of scientifi c
certainty’ offers neither.” People v Urban, 504 Mich 950, 950-951, 951
n 1 (2019) (applying the Coy standard “[b]ecause neither party
argue[d that it] should be overruled” and declining to “addres s
whether it is the appropriate standard”) (citation omitted).
“DNA statistical analysis determines the frequency with which a
particular match occurs in a target population—how likely or
unlikely it is that an individual other than the defendant has the
same DNA bands as those found at the crime scene and in [a]
defendant’s blood.” People v Chandler, 211 Mich App 604, 608, 61 1
(1995) (admission of DNA statistical interpretation evidence doe s
not require a Davis-Frye hearing). See also People v Leonard, 224 Mic h
App 569, 591 (1997) (“statistical evidence need not be subjected to a
Davis-Frye test”; “any challenges to the statistical evidence ar e
relevant to the weight of the evidence and not to its admissibility”).
The admission of testimony that there was a “potential matc h
between defendant’s DNA and the DNA contained in the mixed
blood samples found on the knife blade and the doorknob” violated
MRE 702 and MRE 403 because no analytic or interpretive evidence
concerning the likelihood or significance of a DNA profile matc h
was admitted and without testimony explaining the statistical
significance of a potential match, the testimony about a potential
match did not assist the jury in determining whether the defendan t
contributed DNA to the mixed sample. Coy I, 243 Mich App at 301-
303.

E. Indigent Defendant’s Right to Appointment of DNA
Expert
A defendant may be entitled to a court-appointed DNA expert if the
defendant can make a particularized showing that there exists a
reasonable probability that an expert would be of assistance to the
defense and that denial of expert assistance would result in a
fundamentally unfair trial. See People v Kennedy, 502 Mich 206, 22 8
(2018). See Section 4.1(K)(2) for more information on appointing a n
expert for an indigent defendant.

4.13 Postconviction Request for DNA Testing
A defendant does not have a constitutional due process right t o
postconviction access to the State’s evidence for DNA testing. Dist
Attorney’s Office for the Third Judicial Dist v Osborne, 557 US 52, 55-56, 73-7 4
(2009).
A defendant serving a prison sentence for a felony, if convicted of tha t
felony at trial before January 8, 2001, may petition the circuit court t o
order two kinds of relief: (1) DNA testing of biological material that wa s
identified during the investigation that led to the defendant’s conviction,
and (2) a new trial based on the results of the DNA testing. MCL
770.16(1). “A petition under [MCL 770.16] shall be filed in the circui t
court for the county in which the defendant was sentenced and shall b e
assigned to the sentencing judge or his or her successor. The petition shall
be served on the prosecuting attorney of the county in which th e
defendant was sentenced.” MCL 770.16(2).
MCL 770.16(1) specifically bypasses the ordinary time limitation s
prescribed in MCL 770.2 for filing motions for a new trial. MCL 770.16(1)
begins: “Notwithstanding the limitations of [MCL 770.2] . . . .” MCL
770.2(1) states: “Except as provided in [MCL 770.16], in a case appealabl e
as of right to the court of appeals, a motion for a new trial shall be mad e
within 60 days after entry of judgment or within any further tim e
allowed by the trial court during the 60-day period.”
Under certain circumstances, a defendant convicted of a felony at trial on
or after January 8, 2001, may also petition the court to order DNA testin g
of biological material identified during the investigation leading to his o r
her conviction, and for a new trial based on the results of that DN A
testing. MCL 770.16(1). To petition the court for DNA testing under thes e
circumstances, the defendant must show all of the following:
48See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook, Vol. 3, for information on
postjudgment procedures.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-99
Section 4.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“(a) That DNA testing was done in the case or under this act.
(b) That the results of the testing were inconclusive.
(c) That testing with current DNA technology is likely t o
result in conclusive results.” MCL 770.16(1).
A petition filed under MCL 770.16 must satisfy the following
requirements:
“[The petition] shall allege that biological material wa s
collected and identified during the investigation of the
defendant’s case. If the defendant, after diligen t
investigation, is unable to discover the location of the
identified biological material or to determine whether the
biological material is no longer available, the defendant may
petition the court for a hearing to determine whether the
identified biological material is available. If the cour t
determines that identified biological material was collected
during the investigation, the court shall order appropriate
police agencies, hospitals, or the medical examiner to searc h
for the material and to report the results of the search to the
court.” MCL 770.16(3).
“MCL 770.16 envisions two main phases; the first phase involves th e
court assessing whether DNA testing should be ordered, and the second
phase entails, if DNA testing was ordered, whether a motion for new trial
should be granted.” People v Poole (On Remand), 311 Mich App 296, 311
(2015). It is improper for a court “to conflate the two phases ”
contemplated under MCL 770.16 and to “deny DNA testing on the basis
that [the] court concludes that it would deny a future motion for ne w
trial regardless of the results of any DNA testing.” Poole, 311 Mich App a t
311.
“MCL 770.16(1) does not limit requests for DNA testing to those cases i n
which the biological material itself [led] to the defendant’s conviction”;
rather, MCL 770.16(1) simply requires that the biological material wa s
identified during the investigation that led to the defendant’s conviction.
People v Hernandez-Orta, 480 Mich 1101 (2008) (emphasis added). The
Court reasoned:
“The defendant in this case has presented prima facie proo f
that ‘the evidence sought to be tested is material to the issue
49
of’ his identity as the perpetrator under [MCL 770.16(4)(a) ].
If the DNA from semen found in the victim’s body shortly
after the assault does not match the defendant’s DNA profile,
49Hernandez-Orta references MCL 770.16(3)(a); however, the statute has since been amended and th e
relevant section is MCL 770.16(4)(a). See 2008 PA 410, effective January 6, 2009.
Page 4-100 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.13
this evidence has a tendency to show that defendant is no t
the perpetrator—particularly if the DNA also does not matc h
that of the victim’s boyfriend, with whom the victi m
acknowledged having sexual relations two days before the
alleged offense.” Hernandez-Orta, 480 Mich at 1101.
The following subsections explain the requirements for a court to orde r
postconviction DNA testing and includes a discussion of the rights and
duties established under MCL 770.16.
A. Requirements for Ordering Postconviction DNA Testing
“[I]f a defendant satisfies the required factors with respect to the
question whether DNA testing should be ordered, ‘[t]he court shall
order DNA testing[.]’ MCL 770.16(4) (emphasis added).” People v
Poole (On Remand), 311 Mich App 296, 311 (2015) (alterations in
original).
To qualify for DNA testing under MCL 770.16(4), a defendant mus t
do all of the following:
“(a) Present[] prima facie proof that the evidence
sought to be tested is material to the issue of the
convicted person’s identity as the perpetrator of,
or accomplice to, the crime that resulted in the
conviction.
(b) Establish[] all the following by clear and
convincing evidence:
(i) A sample of identified biologica l
material described in [MCL 770.16(1)] is
available for DNA testing.
(ii) The identified biological material
described in [MCL 770.16(1)] was no t
previously subjected to DNA testing or ,
if previously tested, will be subject t o
DNA testing technology that was no t
available when the defendant wa s
convicted.
(iii) The identity of the defendant as the
perpetrator of the crime was at issue
during his or her trial.”
When deciding a petition for DNA testing under MCL 770.16, a
court must state its findings of fact on the record or must make
written findings of fact supporting its decision. MCL 770.16(5).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-101
Section 4.13 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
The meaning of the term material as used in MCL 770.16(4)(a)
“means that the ‘evidence sought to be tested’ must be of some
consequence to the issue of identity in the case. In other words, the
defendant must provide prima facie proof that there is some logical
relationship between the evidence sought to be tested and the issue
50
of identity.” People v Barrera, 278 Mich App 730, 737 (2008). “[T]he
materiality of . . . blood samples to the issue of identity [of a
perpetrator] is not affected or lessened by the fact that blood-type
evidence excluding [a] defendant as a donor was already presented
at [an earlier jury] trial; all of this scientific evidence is material or
relevant to defendant’s identity as the perpetrator.” Poole, 311 Mic h
App at 311. “DNA testing is justified [where] . . . there exists prima
facie proof that the blood samples, which will be subjected to DNA
testing, are material to defendant’s identity as the perpetrator, give n
that the DNA testing could point to another specific individual a s
the perpetrator.” Id. at 312-313.
B. If the Court Grants Petition for DNA Testing
“If the court grants a petition for DNA testing under this section, the
identified biological material and a biological sample obtained fro m
the defendant shall be subjected to DNA testing by a laboratory
approved by the court. If the court determines that the applicant i s
indigent, the cost of DNA testing ordered under this section shall be
borne by the state. The results of the DNA testing shall be provided
to the court and to the defendant and the prosecuting attorney.
Upon motion by either party, the court may order that copies of the
testing protocols, laboratory procedures, laboratory notes, and other
relevant records compiled by the testing laboratory be provided t o
the court and to all parties.” MCL 770.16(6).
C. Reviewing DNA Test Results and Motion for New Trial
1. Results Inconclusive or Show Defendant is Source
“If the results of the DNA testing are inconclusive or show tha t
the defendant is the source of the identified biological
material,” the court must deny the defendant’s motion for ne w
trial, and the defendant’s DNA profile must be “provided t o
the department of state police for inclusion under the DN A
identification profiling system act[.]” MCL 770.16(7)(a)-(b).
50Barrera references MCL 770.16(3)(a); however, the statute has since been amended and the relevant
section is MCL 770.16(4)(a). See 2008 PA 410, effective January 6, 2009.
Page 4-102 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.13
2. Results Show Defendant Not Source
“If the results of the DNA testing show that the defendant i s
not the source of the identified biological material, the cour t
shall appoint counsel pursuant to MCR 6.505(A) and hold a
hearing to determine by clear and convincing evidence all o f
the following:
(a) That only the perpetrator of the crime or crime s
for which the defendant was convicted could be
the source of the identified biological material.
(b) That the identified biological material wa s
collected, handled, and preserved by procedure s
that allow the court to find that the identified
biological material is not contaminated or is not s o
degraded that the DNA profile of the tested
sample of the identified biological material canno t
be determined to be identical to the DNA profile of
the sample initially collected during the
investigation described in [MCL 770.16(1)].
(c) That the defendant’s purported exclusion as the
source of the identified biological material,
balanced against the other evidence in the case, i s
sufficient to justify the grant of a new trial.” MCL
770.16(8).
D. Retesting Biological Material
“[N]o provision set forth in MCL 770.16 prohibits the issuance of an
order granting DNA testing of previously tested biological
material.” People v Poole, 497 Mich 1022 (2015), citing MCL
770.16(4)(b)(ii).
“Upon motion of the prosecutor, the court shall order retesting of
the identified biological material and shall stay the defendant’ s
motion for new trial pending the results of the DNA retesting.”
MCL 770.16(9).
E. Court Must Make Findings of Fact Regarding Decision to
Grant or Deny Motion for New Trial
“The court shall state its findings of fact on the record or make
written findings of fact supporting its decision to grant or deny the
defendant a new trial under [MCL 770.16]. Notwithstanding [MCL
51
770.3 ], an aggrieved party may appeal the court’s decision to gran t
or deny the petition for DNA testing and for new trial by
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-103
Section 4.14 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
application for leave granted by the court of appeals.” MCL
770.16(10).
F. Prosecutor Must Inform Victim of Defendant’s DNA
Petition
“If the name of the victim of the felony conviction described i n
[MCL 770.16(1)] is known, the prosecuting attorney shall giv e
written notice of a petition under this section to the victim. The
notice shall be by first-class mail to the victim’s last known address.
Upon the victim’s request, the prosecuting attorney shall give the
victim notice of the time and place of any hearing on the petitio n
and shall inform the victim of the court’s grant or denial of a new
trial to the defendant.” MCL 770.16(11).
G. Duty to Preserve Biological Material
“The investigating law enforcement agency shall preserve any
biological material identified during the investigation of a crime or
crimes for which any person may file a petition for DNA testing
under this section. The identified biological material shall be
preserved for the period of time that any person is incarcerated i n
connection with that case.” MCL 770.16(12).
52
4.14 Tracking/Cadaver Dog Evidence
A. Tracking Dog Evidence
1. Foundation
The prosecutor must lay a foundation before the court ma y
admit tracking dog evidence. See People v Norwood, 70 Mic h
App 53, 55 (1976). In laying the foundation, the prosecuto r
must establish that the following conditions are present:
“First, it is necessary to show that the handler i s
qualified to handle the dog. Second, it must be
shown that the dog was trained and accurate i n
tracking humans. Third, it is necessary to show
that the dog was placed on the trail where
circumstances indicate that the culprit was. Fourth,
it is necessary to show that the trail had no t

Institute’s Controlled Substances Benchbook, Chapter 8.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 4.14
become stale when the tracking occurred.”
Norwood, 70 Mich App at 55 (citations omitted).
2. Jury Instruction
When tracking dog evidence is used, the court must give M
Crim JI 4.14.
B. Cadaver Dog Evidence
“[C]adaver dog evidence is not significantly different from other
forms of tracking dog evidence.” People v Lane, 308 Mich App 38, 5 3
(2014). Thus, “the lack of scientific verification of the presence of a
specific scent is not a reason to exclude cadaver dog evidence in a
blanket fashion.” Id. at 54. Instead, trial courts must “consider the
reliability of the cadaver dog evidence in each case.” Id. “[C]adaver
[53] [54]
dog evidence is sufficiently reliable under Daubert and Gilbert
if the proponent of the evidence establishes the foundation that (1)
the handler was qualified to use the dog, (2) the dog was trained
and accurate in identifying human remains, (3) circumstantial
evidence corroborates the dog’s identification, and (4) the evidence
was not so stale or contaminated as to make it beyond the dog’ s
competency to identify it.” Lane, 308 Mich App at 54.

Section 5.1 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
5.1 Hearsay - Generally
Hearsay is “a statement that: (1) the declarant does not make whil e
testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidenc e
to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.” MRE 801(c).
An assertion is something capable of being true or false. See People v Jones
(On Rehearing After Remand), 228 Mich App 191, 204-205 (1998), modified
1
in part and remanded 458 Mich 862 (1998) (concluding that a command
is not an assertion because it is incapable of being true or false). Similarly,
an “implied” assertion does not actually qualify as an assertion, an d
therefore, cannot be hearsay. Jones, 228 Mich App at 225-226.
A statement that is offered in testimony to demonstrate the effect it had
on the defendant “is not offered for a hearsay purpose because its valu e
does not depend upon the truth of the statement.” People v Nelson, __ _
Mich ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In Nelson,
“the trial court erroneously interrupted defendant’s testimony [that he r
then-boyfriend threatened to kill her] and sustained the prosecution’ s
objection that such a statement was improper hearsay.” Id. at ___.
“Defendant did not seek to introduce [his] threat to establish the truth o f
the matter asserted.” Id. at ___. “Instead, defendant sought to introduc e
[his] threat to demonstrate the effect that the statement had on her.” Id. a t
___ (noting that “the parties and the Court of Appeals all agree[d] tha t
[the] threat was not inadmissible hearsay”).
“Under MRE 802, hearsay is not admissible unless it falls under one o f
the hearsay exceptions set forth in the Michigan Rules of Evidence. ”
People v Jones, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “Hearsay within hearsay is inadmissible unless eac h
independent hearsay statement fits within a hearsay exception.” In re
Boshell/Shelton, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “[T]he basic objection t o
hearsay testimony is that if a witness offers an assertion made by a
declarant who does not testify—and if the assertion is offered as evidenc e
of the truth of the matter asserted—the trier of fact is deprived of th e
opportunity to evaluate the demeanor, responsiveness, and credibility o f
the declarant, particularly because the declarant cannot be tested b y
cross-examination.” People v Sykes, 229 Mich App 254, 261-262 (1998).
Generally, “a photograph of someone is not a ‘statement’ for hearsa y
purposes,” although “nonverbal conduct can sometimes be considered a
‘statement’ for hearsay purposes when that conduct is intended by th e
person as an assertion[.]” People v Smith, 336 Mich App 79, 111-112 (2021)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). Where Facebook comment s

made by non-testifying third parties were coupled with photographs an d
“offered by the prosecutor to establish the truth of the matter asserted,
i.e., that defendant was called Brick Head[, and] [t]here was no exceptio n
to the hearsay rule applicable to the comments, . . . the trial court abused
its discretion by admitting the comments into evidence.” Id. (furthe r
finding that there was no evidence in the record to support a finding tha t
nonverbal handgun symbols in a photograph “were intended a s
statements offered for the truth of some matter asserted,” and admissio n
of the photograph did not violate the rule against hearsay).
“[T]he admission of evidence in violation of the hearsay rule does no t
result in automatic reversal.” Smith, 336 Mich App at 115-116 (holding
“that the erroneous admission of . . . exhibits was harmless,” “[g]iven the
cumulative nature of the hearsay evidence, as well as all of the othe r
evidence that placed defendant at the scene of the crime and provided
him with motive”).
Committee Tip:
In addressing a hearsay objection, the following
analysis may be helpful:
Is the proposed evidence a statement, as
•
defined in MRE 801(a)?
Was the statement made by someone other
•
than the witness while testifying?
Is the statement being offered to prove the
•
truth of the matter asserted?
If the proposed evidence is an out-of-court
•
statement, is it admissible because (1) it is being
offered for a nonhearsay purpose (i.e., not for
the truth of the matter asserted); (2) it is not
hearsay under MRE 801(d);2 or (3) it falls under
an exception contained in MRE 803, MRE 803A,
or MRE 804?3
2 See Section 5.2 for a discussion of MRE 801(d).
3 See Section 5.3(B) on MRE 803 hearsay exceptions, Section 5.3(C) on MRE 803A hearsay exceptions, and
Section 5.3(D) on MRE 804 hearsay exceptions. See also the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Hearsay
Flowchart.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-3
Section 5.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
5.2 Nonhearsay
Some out-of-court statements are not hearsay. MRE 801(d). Nonhearsay
statements include prior statements of a testifying witness and a n
opposing party’s statement. MRE 801(d)(1)-(2). These statements are still
subject to relevancy requirements. See MRE 402. The unavailability of a
witness is not relevant to whether testimony is admissible under MRE
801. People v Benson, 500 Mich 964, 964 (2017).
“Contractual documents with legal effect independent of the truth of an y
statements contained in the documents are admissible.” People v
Abcumby-Blair, 335 Mich App 210, 239 (2020).
A. Prior Statement of Testifying Witness
A prior statement of a testifying witness is not precluded as hearsay
solely because the declarant and the witness are the same person.
See MRE 801(c); MRE 801(d)(1). If the statement falls under one of
the categories listed in MRE 801(d)(1), it is considered nonhearsay.
MRE 801(d)(1) states that a statement is not hearsay when “[t]h e
declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about a prior
statement, and the statement:
(A) is inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony an d
was given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, o r
other proceeding or in a deposition;
(B) is consistent with the declarant’s testimony and i s
offered to rebut an express or implied charge that th e
declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recen t
improper influence or motive in so testifying; or
(C) identifies a person as someone the declaran t
perceived earlier.”

1. Prior Inconsistent Statements
For purposes of MRE 801(d)(1)(A), prior inconsisten t
statements are “not limited to diametrically opposed answers
but may be found in evasive answers, inability to recall,
silence, or changes of position.” See People v Chavies, 234 Mic h
App 274, 282 (1999) (quotation marks and citation omitted),
overruled in part on other grounds People v Williams, 475 Mic h
5
245, 254 (2006). “The word ‘inconsistent’ is defined as marke d
4 See Section 3.9(F) on impeaching a witness using prior inconsistent statements.

note.

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.2
by incompatibility of elements, not in agreement with eac h
other, and not consistent in standards of behavior.” People v
Green, 313 Mich App 526, 531 (2015) (quotation marks an d
citations omitted).
Where a prior inconsistent statement is used for impeachmen t
purposes, it “is not regarded as an exception to the hearsay
rule because it is not offered as substantive evidence to prov e
the truth of the statement, but only to prove that the witness i n
fact made the statement.” Merrow v Bofferding, 458 Mich 617,
631 (1998). See also People v Jenkins, 450 Mich 249, 256-257, 260-
261 (1995), where the Court concluded that a prior inconsisten t
statement of a testifying witness was hearsay that wa s
admissible solely for the purpose of impeaching the witnes s
(although admission of the statement was error due to othe r
issues that arose as a result of the statement’s admission).
Committee Tip:
What takes a prior inconsistent statement fro m
being admissible only for impeachment to being
substantively admissible is contained in MR E
801(d)(1)(A), i.e., the statement was made by
the declarant (witness) under oath subject to the
penalty of perjury, or in a deposition.

2. Prior Consistent Statements
The term “‘consistent’ . . . is defined as agreeing or accordant;
compatible; not self-contradictory, constantly adhering to th e
same principles, course, form, etc., and holding firml y
together; cohering.” People v Green, 313 Mich App 526, 53 2
(2015) (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Four elements must be established before admitting a prio r
consistent statement: “(1) the declarant must testify at trial an d
be subject to cross-examination; (2) there must be an express o r
implied charge of recent fabrication or improper influence o r
motive of the declarant’s testimony; (3) the proponent mus t
offer a prior consistent statement that is consistent with th e
declarant’s challenged in-court testimony; and (4) the prio r
consistent statement must be made prior to the time that th e
supposed motive to falsify arose.” People v Jones, 240 Mich App
6 See Section 3.9(F) on impeaching a witness using prior consistent statements.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-5
Section 5.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
704, 706-707 (2000) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Th e
motive mentioned in elements (2) and (4) must be the sam e
motive. Id. at 711. Consistent statements made after the motiv e
to fabricate arises constitute inadmissible hearsay. People v
McCray, 245 Mich App 631, 642 (2001).
Committee Tip:
The fourth element, the timing of the prior
consistent statement, is often at issue. See
People v Mahone, 294 Mich App 208, 212-21 4
(2011).
3. Prior Statement of Identification
MRE 801(d)(1)(C) requires the party seeking to introduce the
evidence to show only that the witness is present and availabl e
for cross-examination. People v Malone, 445 Mich 369, 37 7
(1994). “[S]tatements of identification are not limited b y
whether the out-of-court declaration is denied or affirmed a t
trial. . . . As long as the statement is one of identification ,
[MRE] 801(d)(1)(C) permits the substantive use of any prio r
statement of identification by a witness as nonhearsay,
provided the witness is available for cross-examination. ”
Malone, 445 Mich at 377. In addition, the declarant is irrelevant;
MRE 801(d)(1)(C) does not preclude out-of-court statement s
from a third party. Malone, 445 Mich at 377-378. In Malone, a
witness previously identified the defendant as the victim’ s
shooter, but denied making the identification while on th e
stand. Id. at 371-372. The trial court allowed an attorney and a
police officer, both of whom were present at the prio r
identification, to testify that the witness had made th e
identification. Id. at 374. The Michigan Supreme Cour t
concluded that this testimony was properly admitted a s
substantive evidence under MRE 801(d)(1)(C) because “th e
distinction between first- and third-party statements of prio r
identification does not limit substantive admissibility.” Malone,
445 Mich at 390.
Committee Tip:
Statements delineated as nonhearsay under
MRE 801(d)(1) must be accompanied by th e
Page 5-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.2
declarant/witness testifying who is subject to
cross-examination concerning the statements.
Without this threshold, these hearsay exclusions
are not employable for admission.
B. Opposing Party’s Statement
A statement is not hearsay if it is an opposing party’s statemen t
offered against an opposing party and:
“(A) was made by the party in an individual o r
representative capacity, except a statement made i n
connection with:
(i) a guilty plea to a misdemeanor motor-vehicle
violation; or
(ii) an admission of responsibility for a civil
infraction under a motor-vehicle law;
(B) is one the party manifested that it adopted o r
believed to be true;
(C) was made by a person whom the party authorize d
to make a statement on the subject;
(D) was made by the party’s agent or employee on a
matter within the scope of that relationship and while i t
existed; or
(E) was made by the party’s coconspirator during and i n
furtherance of the conspiracy, if there is independen t
proof of the conspiracy.” MRE 801(d)(2).
The Michigan Supreme Court explained the rationale for admitting
an opposing party’s statement:
“[T]he admissibility of [an opposing party’s] statemen t
springs from a sense of fundamental fairness capture d
in the phrase, ‘You said it; you’re stuck with it.’ Th e
hearsay rule operates to prevent a party from being
‘stuck’ with what others have said without a n
opportunity to challenge them directly before the trie r
of fact. However, there is no reason, given th e
adversarial nature of our system, to extend the rule’ s
protection to a party’s own statements.” Shields v Reddo,
432 Mich 761, 775 (1989).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-7
Section 5.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
1. A Party’s Adoption of Belief or Truth of Statement
Criminal cases. Under MRE 801(d)(2)(B), “[a]dmission of
evidence of a defendant’s silence as a tacit admission of guilt i s
prohibited, unless the defendant has shown his adoption of o r
belief in the truth of the accusation.” People v Greenwood, 20 9
Mich App 470, 473 (1995). In Greenwood, a detective testified
during defendant’s trial for larceny that the defendant wa s
invited to come to the police station to give a formal interview,
but never did. Id. at 472-473. In her closing argument, the
prosecutor relied on this testimony to establish the defendant’ s
guilt. Id. at 473. The Court of Appeals concluded that admitting
the testimony was improper, and, thus the prosecutor should
not have relied on it in her closing argument. Id. The Cour t
stated that “there is no evidence that defendant adopted o r
believed in the truth of the prosecutor’s accusation tha t
defendant remained silent and refused to come into the polic e
station ‘because he [committed the larceny].’” Id.
Medical malpractice cases. In medical malpractice cases, a n
affidavit of merit constitutes a party admission under MRE
801(d)(2)(B). Barnett v Hidalgo, 478 Mich 151, 160-161 (2007).
“[B]y filing the affidavit of merit with the court, plaintif f
manifests ‘an adoption or belief in its truth,’” as required b y
MRE 801(d)(2)(B). Barnett, 478 Mich at 161-162 (plaintiff hired
her own experts to prepare the affidavits, was fully aware o f
their statements in the affidavits, voluntarily submitted thos e
affidavits to support her complaint, and called those experts t o
testify at trial).
2. Statements by Authorized Persons
Criminal cases. It was proper for a trial court to admit a
defendant’s notice of alibi under MRE 801(d)(2)(C) to impeach
the defendant where it was filed by the defendant’s attorney,
“who was a person authorized by defendant to make a
statement concerning the subject.” People v Von Everett, 156
Mich App 615, 624-625 (1986).
Medical malpractice cases. In medical malpractice cases, a n
affidavit of merit constitutes a party admission under MRE
801(d)(2)(C). Barnett v Hidalgo, 478 Mich 151, 160 (2007). “An
independent expert who is not withdrawn before trial i s
essentially authorized by the plaintiff to make statement s
regarding the subjects listed by [MCL 600.2912d(1)(a)-(d)].
Therefore, consistent with the actual language of MRE
801(d)(2)(C), an affidavit of merit is ‘a statement by a perso n
Page 5-8 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.2
authorized by the party to make a statement concerning th e
subject . . . .’” Barnett, 478 Mich at 162.
3. Statements by Agents or Employees
A party should be held “responsible for their choice of a n
agent or employee, and consequently for words spoken and
actions taken by those they have chosen, during the period o f
time they choose to maintain the relationship.” Shields v Reddo,
432 Mich 761, 775 (1989). The Court noted that the statemen t
must be made while the relationship still exists; statement s
made after the relationship is terminated are not admissibl e
under MRE 801(d)(2)(D). Shields, 432 Mich at 775-776. In
Shields, the plaintiff urged the Court to admit into evidence the
deposition testimony of the defendant’s former employe e
7
under MCR 2.308(A)(1)(b) without making a showing of
unavailability. Shields, 432 Mich at 764. The Court stated tha t
“the deposition testimony of a person who was employed by a
party at the time of the occurrence out of which an actio n
arose, but who was no longer employed by the party when th e
deposition was taken, is not admissible in evidence without a
finding that the deponent is unavailable to testify at trial.” Id.
at 785.
4. Coconspirator Statements
In order for a statement to be admissible under MRE
801(d)(2)(E), the proponent of the evidence must establis h
three things:
(1) by a preponderance of the evidence and using
independent evidence, a conspiracy existed;
(2) the statement was made during the course of
the conspiracy; and
(3) the statement furthered the conspiracy. People v
Martin, 271 Mich App 280, 316-317 (2006).
“A conspiracy exists where two or more persons combine wit h
the intent to accomplish an illegal objective.” Martin, 271 Mic h
App at 317. In order to establish that a conspiracy existed, th e
proponent may offer circumstantial or indirect evidence; direc t
proof of the conspiracy is not required to satisfy the firs t
requirement. Id. In satisfying the second requirement, a
7 The Supreme Court amended MCR 2.308(A) at the end of this case “to eliminate the overlap an d
possibility of conflict between MCR 2.308(A) and the Rules of Evidence.” Shields, 432 Mich at 786.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-9
Section 5.2 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“conspiracy continues ‘until the common enterprise has bee n
fully completed, abandoned, or terminated.’” Id., quotin g
People v Bushard, 444 Mich 384, 394 (1993). Idle chatter will no t
show that a statement furthered a conspiracy under the third
requirement. Martin, 271 Mich App at 317. However,
“statements that prompt the listener, who need not be one o f
the conspirators, to respond in a way that promotes o r
facilitates the accomplishment of the illegal objective will
suffice.” Id.
In Martin, the defendant and his brother were charged wit h
crimes arising out of their participation in the operation of a n
adult entertainment establishment. Martin, 271 Mich App at
285. At trial, Angela Martin, the ex-wife of the defendant’ s
brother, testified about certain statements she heard her ex-
husband make, including his admission that sex acts wer e
occurring at the establishment and that he and the othe r
participants financially benefited from the illegal activities. Id.
at 316. Angela further testified that she overheard a telephon e
conversation between the defendant and her ex-husban d
regarding “the VIP cards necessary to access the downstair s
area where acts of prostitution occurred.” Id. at 318. The
defendant was convicted, and on appeal argued that Angela’ s
testimony regarding his brother’s statements was inadmissibl e
hearsay. Id. at 316.
The Court of Appeals noted that trial testimony given befor e
Angela’s testimony provided evidence sufficient to raise a n
inference that the defendant and his brother conspired to carr y
out the illegal objectives of maintaining the establishment as a
house of prostitution, accepting earnings of prostitutes, an d
engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. Martin, 271 Mich
App at 317-318. The Court further noted that because th e
conversation about the use of VIP cards clearly concerned th e
activities covered by the conspiracy, the statements were mad e
in furtherance of the conspiracy. Id. at 318-319. Statement s
made to Angela regarding the financial compensation her ex-
husband and the defendant earned from the establishmen t
were also made in furtherance of the conspiracy because th e
statements informed Angela of her collective stake in th e
success of the conspiracy and served to foster the trust and
cohesiveness necessary to keep Angela from interfering wit h
the continued activities of the conspiracy. Id. at 319. Because
the statements about which Angela testified satisfied th e
requirements in MRE 801(d)(2)(E), they were properly
admitted against the defendant at trial. Martin, 271 Mich Ap p
at 316-319.

Committee Tip:
As with MRE 803(d)(1), the MRE 803(d)(2)
exclusions have a threshold for one of the
described statements, i.e, they must be used
against the party making the statement. Also
note that although these statements are often
called statements by a party opponent, in only
MRE 801(d)(2)(A) is the speaker actually a party.
Rather the rule is designed to impose statement s
made by others on the party. See MR E
801(d)(2)(B)-(E).

5.3 Hearsay Exceptions
Hearsay evidence may be admissible if it comes within an establishe d
exception. See MRE 802. “Hearsay within hearsay is inadmissible unles s
each independent hearsay statement fits within a hearsay exception.” I n
re Boshell/Shelton, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). There are man y
exceptions to the hearsay rule. This section only discusses the mos t
common exceptions.
A. Confrontation Issues
Hearsay statements that are admissible pursuant to a hearsay
exception may still be inadmissible during trial if admission would
violate the defendant’s right to confrontation. US Const, Am VI;
Const 1963, art 1, § 20. See also Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36, 6 8
(2004) (holding that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of
testimonial statements of an unavailable witness unless the
9
defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination). “By it s
straightforward terms, the Confrontation Clause directs inquiry int o
two questions: (1) Does the person in controversy comprise a
‘witness against’ the accused under the Confrontation Clause; and
(2) if so, has the accused been afforded an opportunity to ‘confront’
that witness under the Confrontation Clause?” People v Fackelman,
489 Mich 515, 562 (2011). “[T]he rules of evidence do not trump the
Confrontation Clause.” Id. at 545. In Fackelman, the Michiga n
8 The provisions previously found in MRE 803(24) and MRE 804(b)(7) now appear in MRE 807. See AD M
File No. 2021-10, effective January 1, 2024. See Section 5.3(E). See also the Michigan Judicial Institute’s
Hearsay Flowchart.
9 For a thorough discussion of Crawford and its progeny, as well as discussion of the testimonial or
nontestimonial nature of a statement, see Section 3.5.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-11
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Supreme Court concluded that “the rules of evidence canno t
override the Sixth Amendment and cannot be used to admi t
evidence that would otherwise implicate the Sixth Amendment.” Id.
Accordingly, “a defendant’s constitutional right of confrontation
may be violated when a trial witness’s testimony introduces the
substance of an out-of-court, testimonial statement by a n
unavailable witness.” People v Washington, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024).
Specifically, “the Confrontation Clause is violated when a witness’ s
testimony at trial introduces an out-of-court statement of a n
unavailable witness if the witness’s testimony leads to a clear and
logical inference that the out-of-court declarant made a testimonial
statement.” Id. at ___ (“In such a situation, the defendant is not able
to cross-examine the veracity of the out-of-court statement, and the
defendant is thereby denied his constitutional right to confront th e
witness.”).
The Confrontation Clause is not violated by admission of every out-
of-court, testimonial statement. Washington, ___ Mich at ___, fn 8.
Indeed, “even if the statement is testimonial, ‘the Confrontatio n
Clause applies only to statements used as substantive evidence.’”
Washington, ___ Mich at ___, quoting Fackelman, 489 Mich at 528.
Crawford does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purpose s
other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted. People v
McPherson, 263 Mich App 124, 133 (2004). Thus, the admission of a n
unavailable witness’s former testimonial statement is not barred by
Crawford if the statement is admitted to impeach a witness.
McPherson, 263 Mich App at 133-135. See also People v Chambers, 27 7
Mich App 1, 11 (2007), where the trial court properly admitted a
police officer’s testimony regarding a confidential informant’s out-
of-court identification of the defendant because the testimony wa s
offered to explain how and why the defendant was arrested, not t o
prove the truth of the informant’s tip. But see People v Henry (After
Remand), 305 Mich App 127, 154 (2014), where the trial court’ s
admission of the detective’s testimony regarding the confidential
informant’s out of court statements was improper because the
detective’s testimony “was not limited to show why [the detective]
proceeded in a certain direction with his investigation,” and wa s
instead used to “establish or prove past events potentially relevan t
to later criminal prosecution[.]” Id. (quotations, alterations, and
citation omitted).
“Testifying officers may provide context for their investigation or
explain ‘background’ facts.” Washington, ___ Mich at ___, n 8
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Such out-of-cour t
statements are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted
therein, but instead for another purpose: to explain the officer’ s
actions. These statements often provide necessary context where a
Page 5-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
defendant challenges the adequacy of an investigation. But absent such
claims, there is a questionable need for presenting out-of-court statements
because the additional context is often unnecessary, and such statements
can be highly prejudicial. Statements exceeding the limited need t o
explain an officer’s actions can violate the Sixth Amendment—
where a nontestifying witness specifically links a defendant to the
crime, testimony becomes inadmissible hearsay.” Id. (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted).
Offering testimony to establish chain of custody is not an exception
to the Confrontation Clause. Id. at ___. Indeed, “it is up to the
prosecution to decide what steps in the chain of custody are s o
crucial as to require evidence; but what testimony is introduce d
must (if the defendant objects) be introduced live.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up). In Washington, the “[d]efendant drove across the
border from Michigan into Canada without paying the toll,” and a
Canadian customs agent “arrested defendant and brought him back
to the American side of the bridge” where an American custom s
agent “took custody of defendant and a bulletproof vest.” Id. at ___.
Subsequently, the “[d]efendant was charged with being a violen t
felon in possession of body armor.” Id. at ___. The American officer
testified that he and the Canadian officer met on the American side
of the bridge and, based on communications between them, th e
American officer took custody of defendant and took possession of
the body armor at the same time. Id. at ___. The American office r
“acknowledged that defendant was not wearing the vest when he
took defendant into custody and that he had no direct knowledge a s
to whether defendant ever possessed the vest.” Id. at ___.
“[R]egardless of whether the statement was offered merely t o
establish the chain of custody or to establish that defendan t
possessed the bulletproof vest as an element of the charged offense,
the statement would need to be offered for the truth of the matter
asserted, i.e., that defendant actually possessed the bulletproof
vest.” Id. at ___ (The Canadian officer’s “statement that defendan t
possessed the bulletproof vest was substantive proof that he wa s
guilty of being a violent felon in possession of body armor.”). “Th e
clear and logical inference from [the American officer’s] testimony i s
that during their ‘communications,’ [the Canadian officer] made an
out-of-court statement regarding his belief that defendant possessed
the body armor.” Id. at ___ (holding that the statement wa s
testimonial, that it was erroneously admitted, and that its admissio n
violated the defendant’s constitutional right of confrontation).
“Out-of-court statements that are related by the expert solely for the
purpose of explaining the assumptions on which that opinion rest s
are not offered for their truth and thus fall outside the scope of the
Confrontation Clause.” Williams v Illinois, 567 US 50, 58 (2012)
(plurality opinion) (opinion by Alito, J.). Thus, the Confrontatio n
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-13
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Clause was not implicated in the following colloquy between the
prosecutor and an expert witness from the police laboratory:
“‘Q Was there a computer match generated of the mal e
DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of [th e
victim] to a male DNA profile that had been identified as
having originated from [the defendant]?
“‘A Yes, there was.’” Williams, 567 US at 71-72.
The Williams Court concluded that the emphasized language did
not constitute a statement that was asserted “for the purpose of
proving the truth of the matter asserted–i.e., that the matching DNA
profile was ‘found in semen from the vaginal swabs.’ Rather, tha t
fact was a mere premise of the prosecutor’s question, and [the
expert witness] simply assumed that premise to be true when she
gave her answer indicating that there was a match between the tw o
DNA profiles. There is no reason to think that the trier of fact took
[the expert’s] answer as substantive evidence to establish where the
DNA profiles came from.” Williams, 567 US at 72. In addition,
assuming the laboratory report of the DNA profile had bee n
referenced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, the report did
not violate the defendant’s confrontation right because it was no t
prepared for the purpose of identifying the defendant as the
perpetrator, but only for the purpose of “catch[ing] a dangerou s
rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use agains t
[the defendant], who was neither in custody nor under suspicion a t
that time.” Id. at 84. No one at the laboratory could have known tha t
the profile it produced would inculpate anyone whose DNA profile
was in the law enforcement database: “Under these circumstances,
there was no ‘prospect of fabrication’ and no incentive to produce
anything other than a scientifically sound and reliable profile.” Id. a t
84-85, quoting Michigan v Bryant, 562 US 344, 361 (2011). For both of
these reasons, the United States Supreme Court concluded tha t
there was no Confrontation Clause violation. Williams, 567 US at 86.
Committee Tip:
As with many areas of evidence law, the purpose
for admission can drive the question of
admissibility under the Confrontation Clause.
The right of confrontation does not apply during a preliminary
examination. People v Olney, 327 Mich App 319, 331 (2019) (findin g
that in addition to misunderstanding the law, which alone required
reversal, “the circuit court abused its discretion when it granted
Page 5-14 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
defendant’s motion to quash on the basis that defendant’s right of
confrontation was violated” during his preliminary examinatio n
even though the testimony at the examination would have likely
violated the Confrontation Clause and been inadmissible at trial).
“[A] machine is not a witness in the constitutional sense
and . . . data automatically generated by a machine are accordingly
nontestimonial in nature.” People v Dinardo, 290 Mich App 280, 290-
291 (2010). “A printout of machine-generated information, a s
opposed to a printout of information entered into a machine by a
person, does not constitute hearsay because a machine is not a
person and therefore not a declarant capable of making a
statement.” Id. at 291. In Dinardo, the Court of Appeals approved th e
admissibility of an officer’s DI-177 report “[b]ecause the DataMaster
breath-test results, printed on the DataMaster ticket, were self-
explanatory data produced entirely by a machine and not the out-
of-court statements of a witness[.]” Id.

forfeiture by wrongdoing, and Section 3.5(F) for information on th e
“language conduit” rule.

B. Rule 803 Exceptions
Generally, MRE 803 does not require a declarant to be unavailable
before the evidence will be admitted. However, under Crawford v
11
Washington, 541 US 36 (2004), any testimonial hearsay that i s
offered at trial can only be admitted upon a showing that the
declarant is unavailable and was previously subject to cross-
examination.
1. Present Sense Impression
“A statement describing or explaining an event or condition
made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it” i s
“not excluded by the rule against hearsay, regardless of
whether the declarant is available as a witness[.]” MRE 803(1).
The Michigan Supreme Court requires three conditions to b e
satisfied before evidence may be admitted under the presen t
sense impression exception. People v Hendrickson, 459 Mich 229,
235-236 (1998). In Hendrickson, the Court stated:
10 This subsection addresses selected MRE 803 exceptions; it is not comprehensive. MRE 803 contains 23
hearsay exceptions. MRE 803(1)-(23). See also the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Hearsay Flowchart.
11 See Section 5.3(A) on admissibility under Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36 (2004).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-15
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“The admission of hearsay evidence as a presen t
sense impression requires satisfaction of three
conditions: (1) the statement must provide a n
explanation or description of the perceived event,
(2) the declarant must personally perceive the
event, and (3) the explanation or description mus t
be ‘substantially contemporaneous’ with the
event.” Hendrickson, 459 Mich at 236.
A slight lapse in time between the event and the descriptio n
may still satisfy the substantially contemporaneous requirement .
Hendrickson, 459 Mich at 236. In Hendrickson, the victim calle d
911 and explained that she had just been beaten by he r
husband. Id. at 232. The Court concluded that her phone call
satisfied the substantially contemporaneous requirement because
the victim’s statement “was that the beating had just take n
place” and “the defendant was in the process of leaving th e
house as the victim spoke.” Id. at 237. See also People v
Chelmicki, 305 Mich App 58, 63 (2014) (the victim’s polic e
statement was admissible as a present sense impression wher e
the “statement provided a description of the events that too k
place inside the apartment, . . . the victim perceived the even t
personally, . . . [and] the statement was made at a tim e
‘substantially contemporaneous’ with the event, as th e
evidence showed, at most, a lapse of 15 minutes between th e
time police entered the apartment and the time the victi m
wrote the statement”).
Corroboration (independent evidence of the event) is required.
Hendrickson, 459 Mich at 237-238, 238 n 4 (“strict corroboratio n
requiring a percipient witness, such as a neighbor or polic e
officer” is not required; corroboration “will suffice if it assure s
the reliability of the statement”). In Hendrickson, the
prosecution sought to introduce photographs of the victim’ s
injuries as independent evidence of the beating. Id. at 233. The
Court concluded that the photographs provided sufficien t
corroborating evidence of the event because the “photograph s
show[ed] the victim’s injuries [and] were taken near the tim e
the beating [was] alleged to have occurred. In addition, th e
injuries depicted in the photographs were consistent with th e
type of injuries sustained after a beating.” Id. at 239. “[T]h e
photographs provide credible independent evidence of th e
assault, permitting the admission of the victim’s statement as a
present sense impression.” Id.
Page 5-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
2. Excited Utterance
“A statement relating to a startling event or condition, mad e
while the declarant was under the stress of excitement that i t
caused” is “not excluded by the rule against hearsay,
regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness[.] ”
MRE 803(2).
“To come within the excited utterance exception to the hearsa y
rule, a statement must meet three criteria: (1) it must arise ou t
of a startling occasion; (2) it must be made before there ha s
been time to contrive and misrepresent; and (3) it must relat e
to the circumstances of the startling occasion.” People v
Skippergosh, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). In Skippergosh, the Court of Appeal s
concluded that “[t]he trial court did not abuse its discretion b y
admitting the hearsay testimony of [a witness] to prove a prio r
act of domestic violence under MCL 768.27b.” Skippergosh, __ _
Mich App at ___. “First, the statements unquestionably aros e
out of a startling condition, namely, an assault.” Id. at ___.
“Second, there [was] evidence that the statements were made
before there was time to contrive and misrepresent.” Id. at __ _
(noting that “testimony indicated that [the victim] was activel y
bleeding when she made the statements” and “appeared to b e
‘scared’ at the time”). “Third, and finally, the statements made
by [the witness] related to the circumstances of the startlin g
occasion, as they noted the perpetrator of the assault.” Id. at
___. “Thus, all three elements of the excited-utterance
exception were satisfied, and the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion by ruling that MRE 803(2) allowed admission of [th e
victim’s] hearsay statements.” Skippergosh, ___ Mich App a t
___.
“[I]t is the lack of capacity to fabricate, not the lack of time t o
fabricate, that is the focus of the excited utterance rule. Th e
question is not strictly one of time, but of the possibility fo r
conscious reflection.” People v Smith, 456 Mich 543, 551 (1998).
Although the time between the event and the statement is a n
important factor to consider, it is not dispositive, and the cour t
should determine if there is a good reason for a delay. Id. Som e
plausible reasons include shock, unconsciousness, or pain. Id.
at 551-552. “Unlike MRE 803(1), the present sense impressio n
exception, which requires that the ‘statement describing o r
explaining an event or condition [be] made while the declaran t
was perceiving the event or condition, or immediatel y
thereafter,’ there is no express time limit for excited
utterances.” Smith, 456 Mich at 551 (alteration in original). I n
Smith, the victim was sexually assaulted and made a statemen t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-17
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
about the assault ten hours after it occurred. Id. at 548-549. The
Court concluded that the statement was admissible as a n
excited utterance because the victim’s uncharacteristic action s
during the time between the event and the statemen t
“describe[d] a continuing level of stress arising from th e
assault that precluded any possibility of fabrication.” Id. at 552-
553.
Admission of an excited utterance under MRE 803(2) “does no t
require that a startling event or condition be established solel y
with evidence independent of an out-of-court statement befor e
the out-of-court statement may be admitted. Rather, MRE
1101(b)(1) and MRE 104(a) instruct that when a trial cour t
makes a determination under MRE 803(2) about the existence
of a startling event or condition, the court may consider th e
out-of-court statement itself in concluding whether th e
startling event or condition has been established.” People v
Barrett, 480 Mich 125, 139 (2008).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting several
statements made by the complainant as excited utterances.
People v Green, 313 Mich App 526, 536 (2015). First, the tw o
incidents of sexual contact between the defendant and th e
complainant constituted startling events despite the fact tha t
“neither physical coercion nor violence was alleged in eithe r
occurrence” because “both occurred in the context o f
defendant’s investigating [the complainant] for child abus e
and neglect,” and testimony established that the complainan t
was “very upset and crying during both conversations.” Id.
The first statements “were made within a few minutes o f
defendant’s leaving the apartment, so there was no time t o
contrive and misrepresent his actions,” and the second
statements “were made within hours of defendant leaving th e
apartment, so there was little time to contrive and misrepresen t
his actions.” Id. at 536-537. Finally, the statements “were clearl y
related to the circumstances surrounding defendant’s actions,
which were the startling events.” Id. at 536.
3. Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical
Condition
“A statement of the declarant’s then-existing state of mind or
emotional, sensory, or physical condition (such as intent, plan,
motive, design, mental feeling, pain, or bodily health), but no t
including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fac t
remembered or believed unless it relates to the validity or
terms of declarant’s will” is “not excluded by the rule agains t
Page 5-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a
witness[.]” MRE 803(3).
a. State of Mind
Before a statement may be admitted under MRE 803(3),
the court must conclude that the declarant’s state of mind
is relevant to the case. Int’l Union UAW v Dorsey (O n
Remand), 273 Mich App 26, 36 (2006). For example, a
“victim’s state of mind is usually only relevant i n
homicide cases when self-defense, suicide, or accidental
death are raised as defenses to the crime.” People v Smelley,
285 Mich App 314, 325 (2009), vacated in part on other
12
grounds 485 Mich 1019 (2010). In Smelley, the Cour t
concluded that the trial court abused its discretion i n
admitting statements that purported to show the victim’ s
state of mind before he was killed because the victim’ s
“state of mind was not a significant issue in this case and
did not relate to any element of the crime charged or any
asserted defense.” Smelley, 285 Mich App at 325 (th e
defendant did not assert self-defense, suicide, or
accidental death as a defense, but contended he was no t
the person who murdered the victim).
Where the declarant states that he or she is afraid, the
statement may be admissible to show the declarant’s state
of mind. In re Utrera, 281 Mich App 1, 18-19 (2008). In
Utrera, the respondent appealed the trial court’s order
terminating her parental rights and argued that hearsay
testimony was improperly admitted. Id. at 14. The
Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’ s
decision to admit statements the child declarant made t o
her therapist and to a guardianship investigator
regarding the fear the child felt towards her mother
because these hearsay statements were relevant and
pertained to the declarant’s then-existing mental or
emotional condition. Id. at 18-19.
b. Physical Condition
A declarant’s statement that he or she is in pain from an
accident may be admissible under MRE 803(3). Duke v
American Olean Tile Co, 155 Mich App 555, 571 (1986).
However, statements that describe the circumstances of
the accident are not admissible under this rule. Id.
12For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-19
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Similarly, statements about the declarant’s symptoms may
be admissible, but for purposes of MRE 803(3), it i s
irrelevant where the trauma occurred. Cooley v Ford Moto r
Co, 175 Mich App 199, 203-204 (1988).
4. Statements Made for Purposes of Medical Treatment
or Diagnosis
“MRE 803(4) provides an exception to admit statements made
for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.” People v Jones,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). A statement that “is made for—
and is reasonably necessary to—medical treatment o r
diagnosis in connection treatment” and “describes medica l
history, past or present symptoms or sensations, thei r
inception, or their general cause” is “not excluded by the rul e
against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is
available as a witness[.]” MRE 803(4).
“In order to be admitted under MRE 803(4), a statement mus t
be made for purposes of medical treatment or diagnosis i n
connection with treatment, and must describe medical history,
past or present symptoms, pain or sensations, or the inceptio n
or general character of the cause or external source of th e
injury. Traditionally, further supporting rationale for MRE
803(4) is the existence of (1) the self-interested motivation to
speak the truth to treating physicians in order to receive prope r
medical care, and (2) the reasonable necessity of the statemen t
to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient.” People v Meeboer
(After Remand), 439 Mich 310, 322 (1992). “‘Particularly in case s
of sexual assault, in which the injuries might be latent . . . a
victim’s complete history and a recitation of the totality of th e
circumstances of the assault are properly considered to b e
statements made for medical treatment.’” People v Johnson, 31 5
Mich App 163, 193 (2016), quoting People v Mahone, 294 Mich
App 208, 215 (2011). But see People v Shaw, 315 Mich App 668,
675 (2016) (holding that the victim’s statements to a
pediatrician regarding alleged sexual abuse were no t
admissible under MRE 803(4) where the pediatrician’s
examination “did not occur until seven years after the las t
alleged instance of abuse, thereby minimizing the likelihood
that the complainant required treatment,” and “th e
complainant did not seek out [the pediatrician] fo r
gynecological services[; r]ather, she was specifically referred t o
[the pediatrician] by the police in conjunction with the polic e
investigation into the allegations of abuse by defendant”).
Generally, statements of identification are not admissibl e
under MRE 803(4) because “the identity of an assailant canno t
Page 5-20 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
be fairly characterized as the ‘general cause’ of an injury.” People
v LaLone, 432 Mich 103, 111-113 (1989). In LaLone, the statemen t
of identification was not admissible because it was no t
necessary to the declarant’s medical diagnosis or treatment, and
the statement was not sufficiently reliable because it was mad e
to a psychologist, not a physician. Id. at 113-114. However, “ a
child’s identification of an abuser can be relevant to obtainin g
medical treatment because the physician ‘can assess and trea t
any pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease, make referral s
for other treatment, including counseling, and structure th e
examination to the exact type of trauma the child recentl y
experienced.’” Jones, ___ Mich App at ___, quoting People v
Duenaz, 306 Mich App 85, 96 (2014) (“Although Duenaz
involved sexual abuse, the assessment of the safety of th e
child’s home is also relevant to nonsexual physical
abuse . . . [.]”). “The doctor can also assess whether the chil d
will be returning to an abusive home.” Id. at ___ (quotation
marks and citation omitted). “Generally, identification of th e
assailant can be as important to the health of the child a s
treatment of the physical injuries that are apparent to th e
physician.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Meeboer, the Michigan Supreme Court “held that when a
child’s hearsay statement is offered under the medical-
treatment exception, the trial court should conduct an inquir y
into trustworthiness that takes into consideration the totality o f
circumstances surrounding the declaration of the child’s out-
of-court statement.” Jones, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up).
“‘While the inquiry into the trustworthiness of the declarant’ s
statement is just one prong of the analysis under MRE 803(4), i t
is very important that the understanding to tell the truth to th e
physician be established.’” Jones, ___ Mich App at ___, quotin g
Meeboer, 439 Mich at 324. “‘Factors related to trustworthines s
guarantees surrounding the actual making of the statemen t
include:
(1) the age and maturity of the declarant, (2) the
manner in which the statements are elicited
(leading questions may undermine the
trustworthiness of a statement), (3) the manner i n
which the statements are phrased (childlike
terminology may be evidence of genuineness), (4)
use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar
age, (5) who initiated the examinatio n
(prosecutorial initiation may indicate that the
examination was not intended for purposes of
medical diagnosis and treatment), (6) the timing of
the examination in relation to the assault (the child
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-21
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
is still suffering pain and distress), (7) the timing of
the examination in relation to the trial (involving
the purpose of the examination), (8) the type of
examination (statements made in the course of
treatment for psychological disorders may not be
as reliable), (9) the relation of the declarant to the
person identified (evidence that the child did no t
mistake the identity), and (10) the existence of or
lack of motive to fabricate.’” [Jones, ___ Mich App
at ___, quoting Meeboer, 439 Mich at 324-325
(citations omitted).]
In Jones, the trial court concluded that a three-year-old victim’ s
statement to an emergency room nurse that defendant hit he r
was “sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted under MRE
803(4) despite her young age.” Jones, ___ Mich App at __ _
(“Although [the child’s] age at the time of the statement weigh s
against the trustworthiness of the disclosure, the remainder o f
the limited evidence presented weighs in favor o f
trustworthiness.”). Applying the Meeboer factors, the trial cour t
observed:
“Here, there [was] no evidence that [the child’s]
mother asked a leading question to prompt the
disclosure; the terminology of the disclosure [was]
simple and consistent with language that a three-
year old would use to make a voluntary, truthful
disclosure; there was no prosecutorial involvemen t
at the time the disclosure was made; at the time of
the statement, [the child] had recently been
admitted to the emergency department [and] wa s
being treated for lethargy and a facial bruise tha t
was causing pain; there is no evidence that [th e
child] could have mistaken defendant, her ‘daddy ’
as someone else; and there [was] no evidenc e
suggesting that [the child] had any motivation t o
fabricate the allegation.” [Jones, ___ Mich App a t
___ (fifth alteration in original).]
The Jones Court found the trial court’s analysis and applicatio n
of the Meeboer factors “partially unsatisfactory because the
court did not consider whether [the victim] understood th e
importance of speaking truthfully to the care provider.” Jones,
___ Mich App at ___. “The trial court also did not refer to [th e
child’s mother’s] testimony that [the emergency room nurse]
asked [the child] the question multiple times until [the child]
named defendant.” Id. at ___. “Under these circumstances ,
there [was] a close question regarding whether the trial cour t
properly found that the statement was admissible under MRE
Page 5-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
803(4).” Jones, ___ Mich App at ___. “However, the trial court’ s
decision regarding a close evidentiary question generally doe s
not constitute an abuse of discretion.” Id. at ___ (concludin g
that “even if the statement was erroneously admitted ,
defendant fail[ed] to establish a miscarriage of justice
warranting reversal”).
5. Recorded Recollection
A record that “is on a matter the witness once knew about bu t
now cannot recall well enough to testify fully and accurately, ”
“was made or adopted by the witness when the matter wa s
fresh in the witness’s memory,” and “accurately reflects th e
witness’s knowledge” is “not excluded by the rule agains t
hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a
witness[.]” MRE 803(5). “If admitted, the record may be read
into evidence but may be received as an exhibit only if offere d
by an adverse party.” Id.
In order to admit evidence pursuant to MRE 803(5), th e
following foundational requirements must be met:
“‘(1) The document must pertain to matters abou t
which the declarant once had knowledge;
(2) The declarant must now have an insufficien t
recollection as to such matters; [and]
(3) The document must be shown to have bee n
made by the declarant or, if made by one other
than the declarant, to have been examined by the
declarant and shown to accurately reflect the
declarant’s knowledge when the matters were
fresh in his memory.’” People v Daniels, 192 Mich
App 658, 667-668 (1992), quoting People v J D
Williams (After Remand), 117 Mich App 505, 508-509
(1982).
See also People v Dinardo, 290 Mich App 280, 288 (2010), wher e
the Court of Appeals concluded that a DI-177 breath-tes t
report is a hearsay document that may be admitted as a
recorded recollection under MRE 803(5) if it satisfies the
requirements in Daniels, 192 Mich App at 667-668. In Dinardo,
the defendant was arrested for drunk driving and was tested
for alcohol using a DataMaster machine. Dinardo, 290 Mic h
App at 283. The officer testified that he wrote the results of th e
alcohol test on a DI-177 report at the time of the test, that he n o
longer recalled the specific results of the test, and that he did
13
not have a copy of the original DataMaster ticket. Id. at 283-
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-23
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
284. The Court concluded that “the DI-177 report plainl y
satisfies all three requirements for admissibility [under MRE
803(5)]. [The officer] saw the DataMaster ticket and therefore
had personal knowledge of the breath-test results at the tim e
he recorded them onto the DI-177 report. Furthermore, [th e
officer] indicated that he no longer [had] any independen t
recollection of the specific results printed on the DataMaste r
ticket. Lastly, it is undisputed that [the officer] personall y
prepared the DI-177 report.” Dinardo, 290 Mich App at 293.
Therefore, the officer was permitted to read the contents of th e
report into evidence at trial. Id. at 294.
“MRE 803(5) does not require a showing that the witness wa s
totally unable to recall the memorandum’s contents, but onl y
that the witness ‘now has insufficient recollection to enabl e
him to testify fully and accurately.’” People v Missias, 106 Mic h
App 549, 554 (1981).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting th e
victim’s statement, written down for police shortly after the y
responded to an incident of domestic violence, when, at trial,
the victim “recalled certain events after reading [her writte n
statement], but otherwise testified that the statement did no t
refresh her recollection.” People v Chelmicki, 305 Mich App 58,
62 (2014). The statement was admissible under MRE 803(5)
because the statement “pertained to a matter about which th e
declarant had sufficient personal knowledge, sh e
demonstrated an inability to sufficiently recall those matters a t
trial, and the police statement was made by the victim whil e
the matter was still fresh in her memory.” Chelmicki, 305 Mic h
App at 64.
“Where it appears likely that the contents of a deposition wil l
be read to the jury, the court should encourage the parties t o
prepare concise, written summaries of the depositions fo r
reading at trial in lieu of the full deposition. Where a summar y
is prepared, the opposing party shall have the opportunity t o
object to its contents. Copies of the summaries should b e
provided to the jurors before they are read.” MCR 2.513(F).
13 “A Datamaster ticket apparently states the blood alcohol percentage for each sample, the time when the
testing procedure began (including the observation period before the test), and the exact time when eac h
sample was taken and analyzed.” Dinardo, 290 Mich App at 283 n1.
Page 5-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
Committee Tip:
Recorded recollection, sometimes called past
recollection recorded, is one of just a few
evidence rules that prescribe a limited format of
admissibility. The document may be read to the
jury by the proponent but not physically
introduced. Introducing the document is left to
the opposing party.
6. Records of Regularly Conducted Activity
“A record of an act, transaction, occurrence, event, condition,
opinion, or diagnosis” is “not excluded by the rule agains t
hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a
witness” if:
“(A) the record was made at or near the time by—
or from information transmitted by—someon e
with knowledge;
(B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly
conducted activity of a business, organization,
occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;
(C) making the record was a regular practice of
that activity;
(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony
of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by
a certification that complies with a rule prescribed
by the Supreme Court or with a statute permittin g
certification; and
(E) the opponent does not show that the source of
information or the method or circumstances of
preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.”
MRE 803(6).
“The rules of evidence allow the admission of hearsa y
evidence compiled through regularly conducted activity unde r
MRE 803(6)—the business-records exception to the hearsay
rule.” People v Dingee, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). Th e
Michigan Supreme Court summarized the business record s
hearsay exception as follows:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-25
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“In order to ensure the same high degree of
accuracy and reliability upon which the
traditional, but narrowly construed busines s
records exception was founded, the current rule s
also recognize that trustworthiness is the principal
justification giving rise to the exception.
Thus, . . . MRE 803(6) provide[s] tha t
trustworthiness is presumed, subject to rebuttal,
when the party offering the evidence establishe s
the requisite foundation. Even though proffered
evidence may meet the literal requirements of the
rule, however, the presumption of trustworthines s
is rebutted where the source of information or the
method or circumstances of preparation indicate
lack of trustworthiness.” Solomon v Shuell, 435 Mic h
104, 125-126 (1990) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
If a party makes a timely objection, the court must determin e
whether the proffered evidence lacks trustworthiness, and if s o
lacking, refuse to admit the evidence under MRE 803(6).
Solomon, 435 Mich at 126. “[T]rustworthiness is . . . an expres s
condition of admissibility.” Id. at 128. In Solomon (a wrongful
death action), the defendant-police officers offered four polic e
reports into evidence detailing a shooting that resulted in th e
death of the decedent. Id. at 108. The Michigan Supreme Cour t
held that the circumstances under which the reports wer e
generated clearly indicated a lack of trustworthiness becaus e
the defendants had an obvious motive to misrepresent the fact s
(they were under investigation for the death). Id. at 126-127.
“MRE 803(6) gives the trial court discretion to conside r
whether any particular circumstances undercut the indicia o f
trustworthiness that is generally presumed to apply t o
business records.” People v Fontenot, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2022).
“[N]owhere in MRE 803(6) is there any limitation on th e
meaning of ‘trustworthiness’ or specification of how or why a
record might lack trustworthiness.” Fontenot, ___ Mich at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “[T]rustworthiness is,
under MRE 803(6) an express condition of admissibility.”
Fontenont, ___ Mich at ___ (cleaned up). “The lack of a direc t
employer-employee relationship, without more, does no t
indicate a lack of trustworthiness.” Id. at ___ (holding that the
trial court “erred by determining that the MRE 803(6)
exception did not apply because the DataMaster technicia n
was employed by a contractor rather than directly by the stat e
of Michigan” and remanding so “the trial court may consider
further arguments on the issue of trustworthiness”).
Page 5-26 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
“The hearsay exception in MRE 803(6) is based on the inheren t
trustworthiness of business records. That trustworthiness i s
undermined when the records are prepared in anticipation o f
litigation.” People v McDaniel, 469 Mich 409, 414 (2003 )
(concluding that a police laboratory report that had been use d
at trial to identify a seized substance was inadmissible hearsa y
under MRE 803(6) due to the source of the information, or the
methods or circumstances of preparation of the report, whic h
indicated a lack of trustworthiness). However, fingerprin t
cards may be admissible under MRE 803(6) as long as they are
not prepared in anticipation of litigation. People v Jambor (On
Remand), 273 Mich App 477, 483-484 (2007). In Jambor, the
Court concluded that fingerprint cards were admissible unde r
MRE 803(6) because an adversarial relationship did not exis t
between the defendant and law enforcement at the time th e
fingerprint cards were prepared. Jambor, 273 Mich App at 483-
484. “[T]he fingerprint cards were prepared during the norma l
course of investigating a crime scene.” Id. at 483.
Pursuant to MRE 805 (hearsay within hearsay), the proponen t
of the evidence must “establish an appropriate foundation fo r
each independent hearsay statement to fall within a hearsa y
exception[.]” Solomon, 435 Mich at 129.
Generally, “to lay a proper foundation for the admission o f
business records using the testimony of a qualified witness, th e
party seeking their admission must present a witness wit h
knowledge of the business involved and its regular practices. ”
People v Englebrecht, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up).
Notably, “these foundational requirements do not require th e
party seeking admission to produce the author of the record s
or even a person who can interpret the content of the records. ”
Id. at ___. “Instead, the qualified witness need only show tha t
the records were made in the ordinary course of business and
were made at or near the times of the transactions.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up). In Englebrecht, the witness “was not intimatel y
familiar with the business end of running the [adult foster care,
but] he was able to identify what the records were, why they
were kept, and when they were created.” Id. at ___. “He als o
verified that [his wife, who ran the adult foster care,] created
the records and that it was her handwriting on them.” Id. a t
___. “Thus, the prosecution presented sufficient evidence t o
show that the records were trustworthy, were made in th e
ordinary course of business and were made at or near the time s
of the transactions.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). Accordingly, “the
prosecution laid a sufficient foundation for admitting th e
business records under MRE 803(6).” Englebrecht, ___ Mich
App at ___.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-27
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“Ordinarily, for a record to be admissible under [the business-
records exception to the hearsay rule], the record must b e
authenticated by a custodian of the records.” Dingee, ___ Mic h
App at ___. “Under MRE 902, extrinsic evidence of authenticity
as a condition precedent to admissibility is not required wit h
respect to certain types of documents.” Dingee, ___ Mich Ap p
at ___ (cleaned up). In Dingee, the defendant asserted “that th e
prosecutor had to strictly comply with the notice provision s
stated under MRE 902(11) before the trial court could admit th e
[Facebook] records.” Dingee, ___ Mich App at ___. “The
prosecutor listed the Facebook records as evidence that sh e
intended to admit in her notice of the evidence, but she did no t
specifically state that she intended to admit the evidence usin g
MRE 902(11).” Dingee, ___ Mich App at ___. “Because th e
prosecutor did not send a formal written notice, [defendant ]
maintain[ed] that the trial court could not admit the record s
under MRE 803(6).” Dingee, ___ Mich App at ___. “Althoug h
the prosecutor did not provide a separate, formal notice to th e
defense in which she related that she intended to admit th e
Facebook records as self-authenticating documents unde r
MRE 902(11), she nevertheless met the minimum requirement s
of that rule with her disclosure because she both identified
certified records and social media posts as evidence that sh e
intended to admit, and the context provided by th e
preliminary examination made it amply clear that th e
Facebook records were the social media posts that wer e
certified.” Dingee, ___ Mich App at ___. “Accordingly, the tria l
court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed th e
prosecutor to admit the Facebook records as self-
authenticating records under MRE 902(11).” Dingee, ___ Mic h
App at ___.
Committee Tip:
Note that in the first five hearsay exceptions
under MRE 803, trustworthiness is implicit and i s
the governing principle. In MRE 803(6),
trustworthiness is expressly mentioned and the
lack thereof can violate use of the exception. See
also MRE 803(7).
Page 5-28 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
7. Absence of Record
“Evidence that a matter is not included in a record describe d
in” MRE 803(6) is “not excluded by the rule against hearsay,
regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness” if:
“(A) the evidence is admitted to prove that the
matter did not occur or exist;
(B) a record was regularly kept for a matter of tha t
kind; and
(C) the opponent does not show that the possible
source of the information or other circumstance s
indicate a lack of trustworthiness.” MRE 803(7).
MRE 803(7) permits admission of evidence that there were n o
recorded reports of an allegation of sexual assault becaus e
such evidence is “of a kind of which a memorandum, report,
record, or data compilation [is] regularly made and preserved,
. . . [and] evidence that no report was ever made wa s
admissible to prove the nonoccurence or nonexistence of th e
matter[.]” People v Marshall, 497 Mich 1023, 1023 (2015) (firs t
alteration in original) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
8. Public Records
“A record or statement of a public office” is “not excluded b y
the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant i s
available as a witness” if it sets out:
“(A) the office’s activities; or
(B) a matter observed while under a legal duty t o
report, but not including:
(i) in a criminal case, a matter observed b y
law-enforcement personnel; and
(ii) information to which the limitations i n
14
MCL 257.624 apply.” MRE 803(8).
“[T]he principle justification for excepting public records fro m
the hearsay rule is trustworthiness, which is generally ensured
when records are prepared under circumstances providing a n
official duty to observe and report.”Solomon v Shuell, 435 Mich
104, 131 (1990). Where documents are prepared in anticipatio n
14 A motor vehicle accident report required by Chapter 6 of the Michigan Vehicle Code “shall not be
available for use in a court action[.]” MCL 257.624(1).

of litigation or the preparer or source of information has a
motive to misrepresent the information, they are no t
admissible under MRE 803(8) because they lac k
trustworthiness. Solomon, 435 Mich at 131-132. Pursuant t o
MRE 805 (hearsay within hearsay), the proponent of th e
evidence must “establish an appropriate foundation for eac h
independent hearsay statement to fall within a hearsa y
exception[.]” Solomon, 435 Mich at 129.
In Solomon (a wrongful death action), the defendant-police
officers offered four police reports into evidence detailing a
shooting that resulted in the death of the decedent. Solomon,
435 Mich at 108. The Michigan Supreme Court held that th e
circumstances under which the reports were generated clearl y
indicated a lack of trustworthiness because the defendants had
an obvious motive to misrepresent the facts (they were unde r
investigation for the death). Id. at 132-133.
Police reports may be admissible under MRE 803(8), as long a s
they are not prepared in a setting that is adversarial to th e
defendant. People v McDaniel, 469 Mich 409, 413 (2003). In
McDaniel (a drug case), a police laboratory report was
inadmissible under MRE 803(8) because it was adversarial ;
“[i]t was destined to establish the identity of the substance—a n
element of the crime for which defendant was charged[.] ”
McDaniel, 469 Mich at 413.
Under certain circumstances, public records may be self-
authenticating. See MRE 902(1)-(4).
9. Judgment of a Previous Conviction
“Evidence of a final judgment of conviction” is “not excluded
by the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant
is available as a witness” if:
“(A) the judgment was entered after a trial or
guilty plea, but not a nolo contendere plea unles s
[15]
allowed by MRE 410;
(B) the conviction was for a crime punishable by
death or by imprisonment for more than a year;
(C) the evidence is admitted to prove any fac t
essential to the judgment; and
15See Section 2.10 for discussion of MRE 410 and plea discussions.
Page 5-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
(D) when offered by the prosecutor in a criminal
case for a purpose other than impeachment, the
judgment was against the defendant.” MRE
803(22).
“The pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affec t
admissibility.” Id.
16
C. Rule 803A Exception: Child’s Statement About Sexual
17
Act
18
In criminal and delinquency proceedings only, MRE 803A(a), a
child’s “statement describing an incident that included a sexual ac t
performed with or on the declarant by the defendant or an
accomplice is admissible to the extent that it corroborates testimony
given by the declarant during the same proceeding if:
(1) the declarant was under the age of ten when th e
statement was made;
(2) the statement is shown to have been spontaneou s
and without indication of manufacture;
(3) either the declarant made the statement immediatel y
after the incident or any delay is excusable as havin g
been caused by fear or other equally effectiv e
circumstance;
(4) the statement is introduced through the testimony o f
someone other than the declarant; and
(5) the proponent of the statement makes known to th e
adverse party the intent to offer it and its particular s
sufficiently before the trial or hearing to provide th e
adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to mee t
it.” MRE 803A(b).
“If the declarant made more than one corroborative statement abou t
the incident, only the first is admissible under [MRE 803A].” Id.
16 See Section 3.6 on child witnesses.
17 See Section 5.3(A) on admissibility under Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36, 68 (2004). See also the
Michigan Judicial Institute’s Hearsay Flowchart.
18 See also MCR 3.972(C), which applies to child protective proceedings and contains a rule similar to MR E
803A; In re Boshell/Shelton, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (“Though MCR 3.972(C)(2) provides an
exception for the admission at trial of a child’s hearsay statements about abuse, the trial court never hel d
the requisite hearing to determine whether the circumstances surrounding [the child’s] forensic intervie w
had adequate indicia of trustworthiness, such that her statements could be admitted under MC R
3.972(C)(2).”).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-31
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Committee Tip:
Notice that this is one of the few rules of
evidence requiring advance notice for its use as a
hearsay exception. Moreover, the rule has
multiple necessary “elements,” the absence of
which will relegate the request for admission
unsatisfied.
Spontaneity. Generally, in order for a statement to b e
spontaneous under MRE 803A, “the declarant-victim [must ]
initiate the subject of sexual abuse.” People v Gursky, 486 Mic h
596, 613 (2010). Statements subject to analysis under MRE 803A
fall into three groups: (1) purely impulsive statements (thos e
that “come out of nowhere” or “out of the blue”); (2) no n
sequitur statements (those made as a result of prompt, plan, o r
questioning, but “are in some manner atypical, unexpected, o r
do not logically follow from the prompt”); and (3) statement s
made in answer to open-ended and nonleading questions bu t
“include answers or information outside the scope of th e
questions” (these are the most likely to be nonspontaneous and
require extra scrutiny). Gursky, 486 Mich at 610-612. To fin d
spontaneity in statements falling into the third category o f
possible spontaneous statements, “the child must broach th e
subject of sexual abuse, and any questioning or prompts fro m
adults must be nonleading and open-ended[.]” Id. at 614.
The Michigan Supreme Court emphasized that this holdin g
does not automatically preclude a statement’s admissibilit y
under MRE 803A simply because the statement was made as a
result of adult questioning. Gursky, 486 Mich at 614. “When
questioning is involved, trial courts must look specifically a t
the questions posed in order to determine whether th e
questioning shaped, prompted, suggested, or otherwis e
implied the answers.” Id. at 615. In Gursky, the facts of the cas e
showed that (1) the victim did not initiate the subject of sexua l
abuse; (2) the victim “did not come forth with her statement s
on her own initiative, and thus that the statements were no t
necessarily products of her creation”; and (3) the adul t
questioning the victim “specifically suggested defendant’ s
name to [the victim.]” Id. at 616-617. Therefore, the Cour t
concluded that the victim’s statements were not spontaneou s
and, thus, inadmissible under MRE 803A. Gursky, 486 Mich a t
617.
Page 5-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
The Gursky Court went on to stress that spontaneity is not th e
only factor a court must look at in order to determine th e
admissibility of a statement pursuant to MRE 803A; even after
finding that a statement is spontaneous, the trial court “mus t
nevertheless also conduct the separate analyses necessary t o
determine whether the statement meets the other independen t
requirements of MRE 803A.” Gursky, 486 Mich at 615-616.
Multiple corroborative statements. “MRE 803A . . . permit s
only the first corroborative statement as to each incident tha t
included a sexual act performed with or on the declarant b y
the defendant. Though the [rule] does not define the ter m
incident, it is commonly understood to mean an occurrence o r
event, or a distinct piece of action, as in a story.” People v
Douglas, 496 Mich 557, 575 (2014) (quotation marks and citation
omitted). Consequently, a child-victim’s disclosure to a forensi c
interviewer of a sexual act that is inadmissible under MRE
803A because it was not the child’s first corroborativ e
statement “does not become admissible under MRE 803A
simply because her first disclosure of [a separate] inciden t
followed shortly after it.” Douglas, 496 Mich at 576, 582-58 3
(also holding that the evidence was inadmissible under th e
19
residual hearsay exception (MRE 807), and ultimatel y
concluding that the evidentiary errors required reversal and a
new trial).
However, a statement that is inadmissible under MRE 803A
because it is a subsequent corroborative statement, is no t
precluded from being admitted via another hearsay exception.
People v Katt, 468 Mich 272, 294-297 (2003) (holding the
statement was admissible under the residual hearsa y
exception).
20
D. Rule 804 Exceptions
Hearsay exceptions that apply only when the declarant i s
unavailable are set forth in MRE 804(b). A declarant is no t
unavailable as a witness “if the statement’s proponent procured or
wrongfully caused the declarant’s unavailability as a witness i n
order to prevent the declarant from attending or testifying.” MRE
804(a). The plain language of MRE 804(a) “mandates that the cour t
19The provisions previously found in MRE 803(24) now appear in MRE 807. See ADM File No. 2021-10,
effective January 1, 2024. See Section 5.3(E) for information on the residual exception to the hearsay rule.
20 See Section 5.3(A) on admissibility under Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36, 68 (2004). See also th e
Michigan Judicial Institute’s Hearsay Flowchart. The following sub-subsections discuss selected exceptions
to the rules against hearsay when the declarant is unavailable as a witness; see MRE 804(b)(1)-(6) for a
complete list of these exceptions.

consider whether the conduct of the proponent of the statement wa s
for the purpose of causing the declarant to be unavailable.” People v
Lopez, 501 Mich 1044, 1044 (2018) (although the trial court “foun d
that the witness was unavailable because he felt threatened by the
prosecutor,” it “did not consider whether the prosecutor intended t o
cause the declarant to refuse to testify when engaging in tha t
conduct”).
“The trial court did not abuse its discretion by declaring [two child-
witnesses] to be unavailable” where the witnesses’ father refused t o
allow them to testify after they were threatened. People v Garay, 320
Mich App 29, 36-37 (2017), rev’d and vacated in part on other
21
grounds 506 Mich 936 (2020). Although this situation “is no t
expressly addressed under MRE 804(a), . . . it is of the sam e
character as other situations outlined in the rule.” Garay, 320 Mich
App at 36. The testimony about the dangerous character of the
witnesses’ neighborhood, a Facebook threat against one of the
witnesses, and the fact that the father’s refusal to allow them t o
testify was out of fear for their safety showed “that the reason for
the refusal to testify was self-preservation.” Id. at 37. “While the
better practice would have been to make a record of their
unavailability by examining each [witness] as to any threat s
received and the factors that influenced their refusal to testify, the
trial court’s decision to declare [the witnesses] unavailable wa s
within the range of reasonable and principled outcomes.” Id.
A witness who abruptly leaves the courthouse before testifying may
be unavailable for purposes of MRE 804(a)(2). People v Adams, 233
Mich App 652, 658-659 (1999). See also People v Wood, 307 Mich Ap p
485, 517-518 (2014), vacated in part on other grounds 498 Mich 91 4
22
(2015), where the trial court properly found that the witness wa s
unavailable based on “‘then existing physical . . . illness o r
infirmity’” because the witness was under a “doctor’s order
confining her to ‘bed rest as a result of complications associated
with her pregnancy’”; People v Garland, 286 Mich App 1, 7 (2009),
where the trial court properly found that the victim was unavailable
as defined in MRE 804(a)(4), where “the victim was experiencing a
high-risk pregnancy, that she lived in Virginia, and that she wa s
unable to fly or travel to Michigan to testify[.]”
“The language of MRE 804(a)(4) includes within its list of
individuals who are unavailable those witnesses who are mentally
infirm at the time they are called to give testimony.” People v

Duncan, 494 Mich 713, 730 (2013). “[W]hen a child attempts to testify
but, because of her youth, is unable to do so because she lacks the
mental ability to overcome her distress, the child has a ‘then existing
. . . mental . . . infirmity’ within the meaning of MRE 804(a)(4) and
is therefore unavailable as a witness.” Duncan, 494 Mich at 717. I n
Duncan, 494 Mich at 730, the four-year-old criminal sexual conduc t
victim “was unable to testify because she could not overcome her
significant emotional distress, a result of the unique limitations of
her youth and, therefore, she was mentally infirm at the time of her
trial testimony.” “As could be expected from a young child,
especially in the context of alleged criminal sexual conduct, [the
child-victim] simply did not have the mental maturity to overcome
her debilitating emotions while on the stand.” Id. at 728.
Accordingly, the lower courts erred by concluding that the child-
victim was not unavailable under MRE 804(a)(4). Duncan, 494 Mic h
at 729-730.
Committee Tip:
Unavailability under MRE 804(a) is a prerequisite
to use of the hearsay exception under MR E
804(b). Observe, however, that absence and
unavailability are not necessarily to be equated.
Only in MRE 804(a)(5) is absence required.
1. Former Testimony
Former testimony that “was given as a witness at a trial or
hearing whether given during the current proceeding or a
different one” and “is now offered against a party who had—
or, in a civil case, whose predecessor in interest had—an
opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct, o r
cross, or redirect examination” is “not excluded by the rule
against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable as a witness[.]”
MRE 804(b)(1)(A)-(B).
Former testimony must meet two requirements to b e
admissible under MRE 804(b)(1): (1) the proffered testimon y
must have been made at “another hearing,” and (2) the part y
against whom the testimony is offered must have had a n
opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony.
People v Farquharson, 274 Mich App 268, 272, 275 (2007). I n
Farquharson, the Court concluded that an investigative
subpoena hearing is similar to a grand jury proceeding an d
thus, constitutes “another hearing” under MRE 804(b)(1).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-35
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
Farquharson, 274 Mich App at 272-275. “Whether a party had a
similar motive to develop the testimony depends on th e
similarity of the issues for which the testimony is presented a t
each proceeding.” Id. at 275. The Court adopted a
nonexhaustive list of factors that courts should use i n
determining whether a similar motive exists under MRE
804(b)(1):
“(1) whether the party opposing the testimony
‘had at a prior proceeding an interest of
substantially similar intensity to prove (or
disprove) the same side of a substantially similar
issue’;
(2) the nature of the two proceedings—both wha t
is at stake and the applicable burdens of proof; and
(3) whether the party opposing the testimony i n
fact undertook to cross-examine the witness (bot h
the employed and the available but forgone
opportunities).” Farquharson, 274 Mich App at 278.
The “defendant had ‘an opportunity and similar motive t o
develop the testimony’ at [his] preliminary examination ”
where (1) the testimony was presented at the preliminar y
examination for the same reason it was presented at the tria l
(to show the defendant conspired to shoot at certain gan g
members and that he shot a particular person), (2) th e
defendant had the same motive to cross-examine the witnesse s
at both proceedings (to show that their testimony lacke d
credibility or was not accurate), and (3) the defendant actuall y
did cross-examine the witnesses with regard to their credibilit y
at the preliminary examination. People v Garay, 320 Mich Ap p
29, 37-38 (2017), rev’d and vacated in part on other grounds 506
23
Mich 936 (2020).
A trial court does not violate MRE 804(b)(1) by “allowing th e
reading of [a witness’s] preliminary examination testimony a t
trial” where the witness is properly deemed unavailable at tria l
and where “[the] defendant enjoyed a prior, simila r
opportunity to cross-examine [the witness.]” People v Wood, 307
Mich App 485, 516 (2014), vacated in part on other grounds 49 8
24
Mich 914 (2015). See also Garay, 320 Mich App at 39 (holding
the trial court properly admitted the preliminary examinatio n
testimony of the witnesses under MRE 804(b)(1) and that th e
admission of the preliminary examination testimony did no t

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
violate the defendant’s right of confrontation where th e
witnesses were unavailable for trial and the defendant cross-
examined them at the preliminary examination).
2. Deposition Testimony
“A witness’s testimony given in a lawful deposition during th e
same or another proceeding, if the party against whom th e
testimony is now offered had—or in a civil case, a predecessor
in interest had—an opportunity and similar motive to develop
the testimony by direct, or cross, or redirect examination” i s
“not excluded by the rule against hearsay if the declarant i s
unavailable as a witness[.]” MRE 804(b)(2).
For MRE 804(b)(2) only, “‘unavailability of a witness’ als o
includes situations in which:
(A) the witness is more than 100 miles from the
place of trial or hearing, or is out of the United
States, unless it appears that the witness's absence
was procured by the party offering the deposition;
or
(B) on motion and notice, exceptional
circumstances make it desirable—in the interests of
justice and with due regard to the importance of
presenting witnesses’ testimony orally in ope n
court—to allow the deposition to be used.” Id.
3. Dying Declaration
“In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil case, a statemen t
that the declarant, while believing the declarant’s death to b e
imminent, made about its cause or circumstances” is “no t
excluded by the rule against hearsay if the declarant i s
unavailable as a witness[.]” MRE 804(b)(3). MRE 804(b)(3)
permits the admissibility of statements made by a declarant a t
a time when the declarant believed his or her death wa s
imminent. The rule does not require that the declarant actuall y
die in order for the statements to be admissible; the declaran t
needs only to have believed that his or her death wa s
imminent. People v Orr, 275 Mich App 587, 594-596 (2007).
24The Court found that the reading of the preliminary examination testimony at trial did not violate the
Confrontation Clause for the same reasons. Wood, 307 Mich App at 516, vacated in part on other grounds
498 Mich 914 (2015). For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative
subsequent history, see our note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-37
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“A declarant’s age alone does not preclude the admission of a
dying declaration.” People v Stamper, 480 Mich 1, 5 (2007). In
Stamper, the declarant was a four-year-old child who stated
that he was dead and identified the defendant as the perso n
who inflicted his fatal injuries. Id. at 3. The Court affirmed
admission of the child’s statement, rejecting the defendant’ s
argument that a four-year-old could not be aware o f
impending death. Id. at 5.
Committee Tip:
The rule does not demand the declarant to say
anything in particular, e.g., “I know I am dying, ”
to establish the belief of imminent death.
Surrounding circumstances can supply the
relevant context.
4. Statement Against Proprietary or Penal Interest
When a declarant is unavailable as a witness, the rule agains t
hearsay will not exclude “[a] statement that:
(A) a reasonable person in the declarant’s positio n
would have made only if the person believed it t o
be true because, when made, it was so contrary t o
the declarant’s proprietary or pecuniary interest o r
had so great a tendency to invalidate the
declarant’s claim against someone else or to expos e
the declarant to civil or criminal liability; and
(B) must be supported by corroborating
circumstances that clearly indicate it s
trustworthiness, if it tends to expose the declaran t
to criminal liability.” MRE 804(b)(4).
a. Proprietary Interest
A declarant’s statement that he shared ownership of a
strip of land with the plaintiffs was admissible as a
statement against proprietary interest. Sackett v Atyeo, 21 7
Mich App 676, 684 (1996). In Sackett, the defendant s
purchased a home owned by the declarant and his wife
who had always maintained a shared driveway with their
neighbors, the plaintiffs. Id. at 677-679. Based on a surve y
conducted before the defendants bought the property tha t
Page 5-38 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
said they owned the entire driveway, the defendant s
erected a fence along their property line, whic h
encompassed the driveway. Id. at 679-680. The plaintiff s
filed an action to quiet title to half of the driveway and
based their suit on the theory of acquiescence. Id. at 680.
The plaintiff-husband testified that the former owner
(who had subsequently died) told him that no matter
what the survey indicated, the plaintiffs owned half of the
driveway. Id. at 678, 684. The Court concluded that th e
25
statement was admissible under MRE 804(b)(4) because
the declarant’s “statement was contrary to his proprietary
interest in his property because the statement was a
statement against his ownership interest in a portion of
his property. A reasonable person would not make such a
statement unless he believed it to be true.” Sackett, 21 7
Mich App at 684.
Statements made against a declarant’s proprietary interes t
are not required to be supported by corroborating
evidence. Davidson v Bugbee, 227 Mich App 264, 267
(1997). The Court stated:
26
“By enacting [MRE 804(b)(4) ], the Supreme
Court specifically provided that statement s
against criminal interests that are offered t o
exculpate the accused must be supported b y
corroborating evidence. The Court did no t
apply any such restriction on the admission o f
statements against proprietary interests in a
civil case, regardless of the circumstance s
under which the statement was made. ”
Davidson, 227 Mich App at 267 (emphasis
added).
b. Penal Interest
Providing a hearsay exception for statements agains t
penal interests is premised “on the assumption tha t
people do not generally make statements abou t
themselves that are damaging unless they are true.”
People v Washington, 468 Mich 667, 671 (2003). Where th e
27
statement is testimonial, the Confrontation Clause i s
25The provisions previously found in MRE 804(b)(3) now appear in MRE 804(b)(4). See ADM File No. 2021-

3.5(D)(2).

implicated. Crawford v Washington, 541 US 36 (2004).
However, the admissibility of a nontestimonial statement i s
28
governed solely by MRE 804(b)(4) because it does no t
implicate the Confrontation Clause. People v Taylor, 48 2
Mich 368, 374 (2008).
“Whether to admit or exclude a statement against a
29
witness’s penal interest offered under [MRE 804(b)(4) ] i s
determined by considering ‘(1) whether the declarant wa s
unavailable, (2) whether the statement was against penal
interest, (3) whether a reasonable person in the declarant’ s
position would have believed the statement to be true,
and (4) whether corroborating circumstances clearly
indicated the trustworthiness of the statement.’” People v
Steanhouse, 313 Mich App 1, 23 (2015), aff’d in part and
30
rev’d in part on other grounds 500 Mich 453 (2017),
quoting People v Barrera, 451 Mich 261, 268 (1996). Tria l
courts must consider the relationship between MRE
31
804(b)(4) and a defendant’s constitutional due process
right to present exculpatory evidence when exercising
32
discretion to admit evidence under MRE 804(b)(4).
Steanhouse, 313 Mich App at 23.
“A statement against a declarant’s penal interest is ‘no t
limited to direct confessions,’ ‘need not by itself prove the
declarant guilty,’ and ‘need not have been incriminating
on its face, as long as it was self-incriminating whe n
viewed in context.’” Steanhouse, 313 Mich App at 23,
quoting Barrera, 451 Mich at 270-271.
A statement that one intends to commit a crime i s
33
inadmissible under MRE 804(b)(4). People v Brownridge,
225 Mich App 291, 303-304 (1997), rev’d in part on other
34
grounds 459 Mich 456 (1999). In Brownridge, the
statements were made before the alleged offense wa s
committed, and thus, were not against the declarant’ s

penal interest. Brownridge, 225 Mich App at 304. “The
declaration must be against one’s pecuniary interest at the
time the statement is made or it fails to qualify as an
exception to the hearsay rule.” Id. (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
The trial court properly concluded that the declarant’ s
statement to the police that he was present during the
crime was not a statement against penal interest where
the declarant made the admission after a detective
informed him that the defendant blamed him for
planning and committing the crime and the detective
claimed to know the declarant was present at the scene.
Steanhouse, 313 Mich App at 23. Further, the declarant’ s
admission to being present at the scene of the crime wa s
in the context of “an extensive explanation of the way i n
which defendant planned and executed the [crime.]” Id.
(emphasis added). The Court concluded that in context,
the declarant’s statement did not subject him to liability t o
the extent that a reasonable person would not have made
the statement unless believing it to be true; rather, i t
appeared the statement was made “in order to emphasize
that he was merely present during the offense and had n o
role in its commission.” Id. at 24. Moreover, the Court
noted that “the mere fact that the declarant invoked hi s
Fifth Amendment right not to testify does not make the
statement against penal interest.” Id. (quotation mark s
and citation omitted).
Inculpatory statements. “[W]here . . . the declarant’s
inculpation of an accomplice is made in the context of a
narrative of events, at the declarant’s initiative withou t
any prompting or inquiry, that as a whole is clearly
against the declarant’s penal interest and as such i s
reliable, the whole statement—including portions tha t
inculpate another—is admissible as substantive evidence
36
at trial pursuant to [MRE 804(b)(4) ].” People v Poole, 444
Mich 151, 161 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds
37
by Taylor, 482 Mich 368.
35 On remand, the Court of Appeals found that admitting the statement was harmless error because it was
admissible as a statement of the declarant’s then existing state of mental, emotional, or physical conditio n
under MRE 803(4). People v Brownridge (On Remand), 237 Mich App 210, 216-217 (1999). Note that the
provisions previously found in MRE 804(b)(3) now appear in MRE 804(b)(4). See ADM File No. 2021-10,

Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
In Taylor, the declarant made two nontestimonia l
statements during two separate telephone calls: the firs t
statement implicated himself, the defendant, and another
individual named King; the second statement only
implicated King. Taylor, 482 Mich at 379-380. The Taylor
Court concluded that the two statements were admissible
as statements against penal interest because they were “a
pattern of impugning communications volunteered
spontaneously and without reservation to a friend, no t
delivered to police, and without any apparent secondary
motivation other than the desire to maintain the benefit s
of the relationship’s confidence and trust—and according
to the record, to brag”; this constituted a narrative of events
38
as required by Poole and [MRE 804(b)(4)]. Taylor, 48 2
Mich at 380 (quotation marks and citation omitted).
The declarant’s inculpatory statement was inadmissible
because “there were no corroborating circumstance s
clearly indicating the trustworthiness of the statement”
and the “statement was not crucial to defendant’s theory
of defense because it clearly implicated defendant in the
39
[crime].” Steanhouse, 313 Mich App at 24. Specifically,
the totality of the circumstances did not demonstrate tha t
the statement was trustworthy because the statement wa s
not spontaneous and was only provided to the police
after the detective reiterated that the defendan t
implicated the declarant in the crime and that the
detective knew the declarant was present; the statemen t
was inconsistent with statements previously made by the
declarant and the statement was made four months after
the crime while the declarant was in custody for a
separate offense. Id. at 26-27.
Exculpatory statements. If a statement “tends to expose
the declarant to criminal liability,” it “must be supported
by corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate it s
trustworthiness.” MRE 804(b)(4)(B). The court has
discretion whether to admit an exculpatory statemen t
40
under MRE 804(b)(4), and “[i]n exercising its discretion,
the trial court must conscientiously consider the
38The provisions previously found in MRE 804(b)(3) now appear in MRE 804(b)(4). See ADM File No. 2021-
10, effective January 1, 2024.
39The Court initially concluded that the declarant’s statement was not against his penal interest; however,
it also analyzed the admissibility of the statement construing it as being against the declarant’s pena l
interest in light of earlier inconsistent statements made to the police by the declarant. Steanhouse, 313
Mich App at 24.
40“The provisions previously found in MRE 804(b)(3) now appear in MRE 804(b)(4). See ADM File No. 2021-

41
relationship between [MRE 804(b)(4) ] and a defendant’s
constitutional due process right to present exculpatory
42
evidence.” Barrera, 451 Mich at 269. According to th e
Michigan Supreme Court:
“[T]he defendant’s constitutional right t o
present exculpatory evidence in his defens e
and the rationale and purpose underlyin g
43
[MRE 804(b)(4) ] of ensuring the admissio n
of reliable evidence must reach a balance. W e
believe they may be viewed as having a n
inverse relationship: the more crucial th e
statement is to the defendant’s theory o f
defense, the less corroboration a court ma y
constitutionally require for its admission. I n
contrast, the more remote or tangential a
statement is to the defense theory, the mor e
likely other factors can be interjected to weig h
against admission of the statement.” Barrera,
451 Mich at 279-280 (citations omitted).
In order to determine whether the declarant’s exculpatory
statement was actually against his or her penal interest,
“the statement [must] be probative of an element of a
crime in a trial against the declarant, and . . . a reasonable
person in the declarant’s position would have realized the
statement’s incriminating element.” Barrera, 451 Mich a t
272. In Barrera, the declarant stated that he was no t
promised anything in return for his statement and wa s
44
advised of his Miranda rights before giving the
statement. Id. at 280-281. The Court concluded that any
reasonable person in the declarant’s position “would have
realized that any admissions by him could implicate hi m
in a crime.” Id. at 281.
In order to determine if the statement was sufficiently
corroborated by other evidence, the Barrera Cour t
adopted the totality of the circumstances test enumerated
in Poole, 444 Mich at 165. The Poole Court stated:
41Id.
42“However, whether a statement was against a declarant’s penal interest is a question of law” reviewed

Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-43
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
“The presence of the following factors woul d
favor admission of such a statement: whethe r
the statement was (1) voluntarily given, (2 )
made contemporaneously with the event s
referenced, (3) made to family, friends,
colleagues, or confederates—that is, t o
someone to whom the declarant would likel y
speak the truth, and (4) uttere d
spontaneously at the initiation of th e
declarant and without prompting or inquir y
by the listener.
On the other hand, the presence of th e
following factors would favor a finding o f
inadmissibility: whether the statement (1 )
was made to law enforcement officers or a t
the prompting or inquiry of the listener, (2 )
minimizes the role or responsibility of th e
declarant or shifts blame to the accomplice,
(3) was made to avenge the declarant or t o
curry favor, and (4) whether the declarant ha d
a motive to lie or distort the truth.” Poole, 44 4
45
Mich at 165.
The Barrera Court further indicated that an additional
three-factor inquiry must be made when a statement i s
made to the authorities while the declarant is in custody.
Barrera, 451 Mich at 276.
“[F]irst consider the relationship between th e
confessing party and the exculpated part y
and whether it was likely that the confesso r
was fabricating his story for the benefit of a
friend. Thus, if the two involved parties d o
not have a close relationship, one importan t
corroborating circumstance exists. The secon d
factor is whether the confessor made a
voluntary statement after being advised of hi s
46
Miranda rights. The third is whether there i s
any evidence that the statement was made i n
order to curry favor with authorities.” Barrera,
451 Mich at 275 (quotation marks, alterations,
and citations omitted).
45 Taylor, 482 Mich at 368, overruled Poole to the extent that Poole applied these factors to its
confrontation analysis because Crawford, 541 US at 36, had been decided and had become the new
standard in confrontation issue analysis. However, it does not appear that the Michigan Supreme Court
intended to overrule the use of these factors in analyzing issues other than confrontation.
46 Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).
Page 5-44 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
In Barrera, the Michigan Supreme Court found that th e
statement in question was critical to the defendant’ s
defense theory, and “his constitutional right to presen t
[the exculpatory evidence] limited the threshold of
corroborating circumstances that the court could require
of [the declarant’s] statement.” Barrera, 451 Mich at 289.
Additionally, the Court found that applying the three-
factor analysis for custodial statements “further
corroborated the trustworthiness of [the declarant’s]
statement.” Id. Specifically, the declarant did not have a
close relationship with the defendant, the declarant made
a voluntary statement after being given his Miranda
rights, and there was no evidence that he gave the
statement to curry favor with the authorities. Id. at 289-
290.
Cautionary instruction. Where the statement agains t
interest involves accomplice testimony, the trial court ha s
47
discretion whether to give a cautionary instruction o n
accomplice testimony. People v Young, 472 Mich 130, 13 5
(2005). The court may give the instruction no matter wh o
calls the witness. People v Heikkinen, 250 Mich App 322,
331 (2002). In Heikkinen (an aggravated assault case), th e
defendant’s son testified that the defendant acted in self-
defense. Id. at 324. The trial court instructed the jury
under M Crim JI 5.5 (witness is a disputed accomplice)
and M Crim JI 5.6 (accomplice testimony). Heikkinen, 25 0
Mich App at 325-326. The Court concluded that these
instructions may be warranted in cases where the
defendant offers potential exculpatory accomplice
testimony; the instructions are not limited to inculpatory
accomplice testimony. Id. at 327-337. The instruction s
were appropriate in Heikkinen because, under the facts o f
the case, the son’s testimony was “inevitably suspect[.] ”
Id. at 337-338.
A cautionary instruction should not be given regarding
accomplice testimony when the testimony is from a
codefendant in a joint trial, and the codefendant would be
prejudiced by the instruction. See People v Reed, 453 Mic h
685, 687 (1996). In Reed, the codefendant in a joint trial
took the stand in his own defense; the defendant’ s
attorney failed to request a cautionary instruction o n
accomplice testimony, and the trial court did not issue a n
instruction sua sponte. Id. at 686-690. The Michigan
Supreme Court concluded that giving such an instructio n
47 See M Crim JI 5.6.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-45
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
would have constituted an error requiring reversal
because it would have asked the jury to view the
codefendant’s testimony suspiciously, thereby prejudicing
his defense. Id. at 693-694.
5. Statement By Declarant Made Unavailable By
Opponent
“A statement offered against a party that wrongfully caused—
or encouraged—the declarant’s unavailability as a witness, and
did so intending that result” is “not excluded by the rul e
against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable as a witness[.]”
MRE 804(b)(6).
“MRE 804(b)(6) is ‘a codification of the common-law equitable
doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing,’ and ‘[u]nder th e
doctrine, a defendant forfeits his or her constitutional right o f
confrontation if a witness’s absence results from wrongdoin g
procured by the defendant[.]’” People v McDade, 301 Mich App
343, 354 (2013), quoting People v Jones, 270 Mich App 208, 21 2
(2006) (citations omitted; alterations in original). “[E]videnc e
offered under the forfeiture exception will very regularly b e
testimonial and subject to Sixth Amendment scrutiny. A s
forfeiture by wrongdoing is the only recognized exception t o
the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of the right to cross-examin e
adverse witnesses, the constitutional question will often g o
hand-in-hand with the evidentiary question[.]” People v Burns,
494 Mich 104, 113-114 (2013).
“To admit evidence under MRE 804(b)(6), the prosecutio n
must show by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) th e
defendant engaged in or encouraged wrongdoing; (2) th e
wrongdoing was intended to procure the declarant’ s
unavailability; and (3) the wrongdoing did procure th e
unavailability.” People v Allen, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). In Allen, “defendan t
told [a romantic partner] during a phone conversation that sh e
did not have to appear in court to testify even if she wa s
subpoenaed.” Id. at ___. Specifically, “in response to [her]
mentioning . . . that because she [had] not received a subpoena,
she was not going to attend the preliminary examination,
defendant said, ‘Even if they did [serve her with a subpoena] ,
do not go.’” Id. at ___. “And while it is true that [she] was neve r
served with a subpoena to appear at trial, defendant’s inten t
was patently clear that he did not want [her] to appear at trial,
which she did not.” Id. at ___. Because “it [was not] clearly
erroneous for the trial court to conclude that defendant’ s
statement to [his romantic partner] caused her to b e
Page 5-46 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
unavailable for trial,” various out-of-court statements sh e
made were properly admitted under MRE 804(b)(6) and rea d
into the record at trial. Id. at ___ (rejecting the defendant’s
argument that his right to confrontation was violated whe n
“[the trial court] admitted the evidence under the forfeiture-
by-wrongdoing rule”; “this forfeiture-by-wrongdoing rule als o
acts as an exception to a defendant’s right of confrontation”).
Id. at ___.
“MRE 804(b)(6) incorporates a specific intent requirement. For
the rule to apply, a defendant must have engaged in o r
encouraged wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure
the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.” Burns, 494
Mich at 113 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasi s
added). See also McDade, 301 Mich App at 354-355 (holdin g
that the trial court’s admission of an unavailable witness ’
recorded interview did not violate the defendant’s right o f
confrontation where the defendant forfeited that right b y
wrongdoing when he conveyed a note to the witness tha t
contained “language that could be construed as threatening ”
and that “reflect[ed] an effort specifically designed to preven t
[the witness] from testifying”; i.e., to make the witnes s
unavailable). Because “the plain language of [MRE
804(b)(6)] . . . incorporates [a] specific inten t
requirement[,] . . . evidence properly admitted under MRE
804(b)(6) will likely also not be barred by the constitutiona l
requirement imposed by the Sixth Amendment.” Burns, 494
Mich at 114, 114-115 n 35. In Burns, it was “alleged that durin g
the alleged [sexual] abuse defendant instructed [the child-
victim] ‘not to tell’ anyone and warned her that if she told, sh e
would ‘get in trouble.’” Id. at 115. Those threats, “mad e
contemporaneously with the abuse but before any report o r
investigation, require a finding that defendant intende d
to . . . procure the unavailability of [the child-victim] as a
witness.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). Th e
Supreme Court “interpret[ed] the specific intent requiremen t
of MRE 804(b)(6)—to procure the unavailability of the
declarant as a witness—as requiring the prosecution to sho w
that defendant acted with, at least in part, the particula r
purpose to cause [the child-victim’s] unavailability, rather tha n
mere knowledge that the wrongdoing may cause the witness’ s
unavailability.” Burns, 494 Mich at 117. Accordingly, the trial
court abused its discretion by admitting the hearsay statement s
of the child-victim under MRE 804(b)(6), because “th e
prosecutor failed to establish by a preponderance of th e
evidence that defendant’s conduct both was intended to, and
did, cause [the child-victim’s] unavailability.” Burns, 494 Mich
at 120.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-47
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
See also People v Roscoe, 303 Mich App 633, 641 (2014), where
the trial court abused its discretion in “fail[ing] to make a
factual finding that defendant had the requisite specific intent ”
to render the witness unavailable to testify. “Although there
was evidence from which to infer that defendant killed th e
victim because [the defendant] was caught trying to steal . . . ,
this does not support an inference that defendant specificall y
intended to kill the victim to prevent him from testifying a t
trial, particularly given that there were no pending charge s
against defendant.” Id. In Roscoe, “the victim was hit in the
head before the breaking and entering had been reported, an d
there was no evidence that the victim said that he was going t o
call the police.” Id. “[W]ithout specific findings by the tria l
court regarding intent, defendant’s action[s] were as consisten t
with the inference that his intention was that the breaking and
entering he was committing go undiscovered as they wer e
with an inference that he specifically intended to prevent th e
victim from testifying.” Id. Accordingly, it was error to admi t
the victim’s statement that identified the defendant as th e
attacker. Id. at 642. However, because there was “ample other
evidence from which [the] jury could conclude, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that defendant killed the victim,” the erro r
was not outcome determinative, and reversal of th e
defendant’s convictions was not warranted. Id. at 642-643.
Committee Tip:
Resist the temptation to simply blame the
accused for the abuse of the witness involved
with the threats. Attention to detail here,
accompanied by a slow, methodical approach,
better serves the analytical record for review.
See Section 3.5(D)(3) for discussion of the forfeiture by
wrongdoing doctrine in context of the Confrontation Clause.

E. Residual Exception
Even if a hearsay statement is not admissible under an exception i n
MRE 803 or MRE 804, the statement may be admitted under the
following conditions:
48See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Hearsay Flowchart.
Page 5-48 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
“(1) the statement has equivalent circumstantia l
guarantees of trustworthiness;
(2) it is offered as evidence of a material fact;
(3) it is more probative on the point for which it i s
offered than any other evidence that the proponent ca n
obtain through reasonable efforts; and
(4) admitting it will serve the purposes of these rule s
49
and the interests of justice.” MRE 807(a).
“The statement is admissible only if the proponent gives an adverse
party reasonable notice of the intent to offer the statement—
including its substance and the declarant’s name and address—s o
that the party has a fair opportunity to meet it.” MRE 807(b).
The residual exception is designed to be used as a safety valve in the
hearsay rules and allows “evidence to be admitted that is no t
specifically covered by any of the categorical hearsay exception s
under circumstances dictated by the rules.” People v Katt, 468 Mic h
50
272, 281 (2003). The Katt Court rejected the near miss theory, whic h
precludes the admission of evidence under a residual hearsay
exception when the evidence “was inadmissible under, but related
to, a categorical exception.” Id. at 282-286. In determining equivalen t
trustworthiness, the court must look at the totality of the
circumstances. Id. at 290-291. Although no complete list of factor s
exist for making this determination, the court should consider
anything relevant to the statement’s reliability except for
“corroborative evidence . . . in criminal cases if the declarant doe s
not testify at trial.” Id. at 291-292 (using this evidence is forbidde n
by the Confrontation Clause). Some factors relevant to the
trustworthiness of a statement include:
“(1) the spontaneity of the statements, (2) th e
consistency of the statements, (3) lack of motive t o
fabricate or lack of bias, (4) the reason the declaran t
cannot testify, (5) the voluntariness of the statements,
i.e., whether they were made in response to leadin g
questions or made under undue influence, (6) personal
knowledge of the declarant about the matter on whic h
he [or she] spoke, (7) to whom the statements wer e

File No. 2021-10, effective January 1, 2024.
50 The Katt Court analyzed the evidence under former MRE 803(24). However, former MRE 803(24)
contains language identical to former MRE 804(b)(7). The only difference is that former MRE 804(b)(7)
requires the declarant to be unavailable. See People v Welch, 226 Mich App 461, 464 n 2 (1997). Note that
the provisions previously found in MRE 803(24) and MRE 804(b)(7) now appear in MRE 807. See ADM File
No. 2021-10, effective January 1, 2024.

made . . . , and (8) the time frame within which th e
statements were made.” People v Steanhouse, 313 Mic h
App 1, 26 (2015), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other
51
grounds 500 Mich 453 (2017) (quotation marks and

F. Statements Narrating, Describing, or Explaining the
Infliction or Threat of Physical Injury in Cases Involving
Domestic Violence, Commercial Sexual Activity, Human
52
Trafficking, or Prostitution
MCL 768.27c is a substantive rule of evidence that allows admissio n
of certain statements in cases involving domestic violence,
commercial sexual activity, human trafficking, or prostitution. Se e
People v Meissner, 294 Mich App 438, 445 (2011). A declarant’s
statement may be admitted under MCL 768.27c if all of the
following circumstances exist:
“(a) The statement purports to narrate, describe, o r
explain the infliction or threat of physical injury upo n
the declarant.
(b) The action in which the evidence is offered unde r
[MCL 768.27c] is an offense involving domestic
violence, or a violation of [MCL 750.448 to MCL
750.462h (offenses involving commercial sexual activity,
human trafficking, or prostitution)].
(c) The statement was made at or near the time of th e
infliction or threat of physical injury. Evidence of a
statement made more than 5 years before the filing o f
the current action or proceeding is inadmissible unde r
this section.
(d) The statement was made under circumstances tha t
would indicate the statement’s trustworthiness.
(e) The statement was made to a law enforcemen t
officer.” MCL 768.27c(1).
MCL 768.27c(1)(a) “places a factual limitation on the admissibility o f
statements,” and MCL 768.27c(1)(c) “places a temporal limitation o n
admissibility.” Meissner, 294 Mich App at 446. Together, these
provisions “indicate that a hearsay statement can be admissible if

Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
the declarant made the statement at or near the time the declaran t
suffered an injury or was threatened with injury.” Id. at 447. I n
Meissner, the victim gave a verbal statement and prepared a writte n
statement for the police that she had been threatened by the
defendant (1) on previous occasions, (2) that morning at her home,
and (3) again that same day, via text message, after telling the
defendant she had contacted the police. Id. at 443. The Court of
Appeals found that “[t]he [trial] court could . . . determine that [th e
victim’s] statements met the requirements of [MCL 768.27a](1)(a)
because the statements described text messages that threatened
physical injury, and met the requirements of [MCL 768.27c](1)(c)
because [the victim] made the statements at or very near the time
she received one or more of the threatening text messages.”
Meissner, 294 Mich App at 447.
For purposes of MCL 768.27c(1)(d), “circumstances relevant to the
issue of trustworthiness include, but are not limited to, all of the
following:
(a) Whether the statement was made in contemplatio n
of pending or anticipated litigation in which th e
declarant was interested.
(b) Whether the declarant has a bias or motive fo r
fabricating the statement, and the extent of any bias o r
motive.
(c) Whether the statement is corroborated by evidenc e
other than statements that are admissible only unde r
this section.” MCL 768.27c(2).
MCL 768.27c(2) expressly states that the court is not limited to the
listed factors when determining “circumstances relevant to the issue
of trustworthiness”; the listed factors are merely “a nonexclusive lis t
of possible circumstances that may demonstrate trustworthiness.”
Meissner, 294 Mich App at 449.
The reference in MCL 768.27c(2)(a) to statements made in
contemplation of “pending or anticipated litigation” “pertains t o
litigation in which the declarant could gain a property, financial, or
similar advantage, such as divorce, child custody, or tort litigation.”
Meissner, 294 Mich App at 450. In cases where the declarant is a n
alleged victim of domestic violence, that provision “does not pertai n
to the victim’s report of the charged offense.” Id.
MCL 768.27c(3) requires the prosecuting attorney to disclos e
evidence he or she intends to offer under the statute, “including th e
statements of witnesses or a summary of the substance of any
testimony that is expected to be offered, to the defendant not les s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-51
Section 5.3 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
than 15 days before the scheduled date of trial or at a later time a s
allowed by the court for good cause shown.”
“MCL 768.27c contains no requirement that the complainant-
declarant be unavailable in order to admit evidence of a statemen t
that otherwise satisfies the statutory requirements.” People v Olney,
327 Mich App 319, 326-328 (2019) (concluding that when ruling o n
defendant’s motion to quash bind-over, the “circuit court erred as a
matter of law in holding that there is an ‘unavailability’ requiremen t
under MCL 768.27c,” thereby “impos[ing] an additional conditio n
not found in the plain and unambiguous language of MCL
768.27c”). “[I]mposing an unavailability requirement woul d
essentially nullify the statute.” Olney, 327 Mich App at 327.
“MCL 768.27c . . . appl[ies] to preliminary examinations.” People v
Olney (On Remand), 333 Mich App 575, 582 (2020). “[T]he plai n
language of MCL 768.27c(6) unambiguously applies at trials and
evidentiary hearings. The preliminary examination is a type of
evidentiary hearing, and thus, the statute applies at that stage.”
Olney, 333 Mich App at 585, 587 (noting that MCR 6.110(D)(2) doe s
not “conclud[e] that preliminary examinations are wholly distinc t
from evidentiary hearings”; MCR 6.110(D)(2) “addresses th e
necessity for a separate evidentiary hearing to decide question s
concerning the admissibility of evidence,” and “[t]hat does no t
mean that preliminary examinations are not a type of evidentiary
[53]
hearing”). Additionally, because “MCL 766.11b(1) addresses the
foundational and authentication requirements for certain report s
and records at the preliminary examination,” and “MCL 768.27c
does not contain any reference to admission of records or other
documents,” but “addresses statements pertaining to physical
injury or domestic violence,” “[t]he omission of MCL 768.27c from
MCL 766.11b(1) does not support [an] attempt to preclude hearsa y
statements pertaining to domestic violence from admission at the
preliminary examination.” Olney, 333 Mich App at 586-587.
G. Statutory Exceptions for Hearsay at the Preliminary
54
Examination
“The rules of evidence apply at the preliminary examination excep t
that the following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay and
shall be admissible at the preliminary examination withou t
requiring the testimony of the author of the report, keeper of the
records, or any additional foundation or authentication:
53See Section 5.3(G) for information on MCL 766.11b(1).
54See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Hearsay Flowchart.
Page 5-52 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.3
(a) A report of the results of properly performed dru g
analysis field testing to establish that the substanc e
tested is a controlled substance.
(b) A certified copy of any written or electronic order,
judgment, decree, docket entry, register of actions, o r
other record of any court or governmental agency o f
this state.
(c) A report other than a law enforcement report that i s
made or kept in the ordinary course of business.
(d) Except for the police investigative report, a repor t
prepared by a law enforcement officer or other publi c
agency. Reports permitted under this subdivisio n
include, but are not limited to, a report of the findings o f
a technician of the division of the department of stat e
police concerned with forensic science, a laborator y
report, a medical report, a report of an arso n
investigator, and an autopsy report.” MCL 766.11b(1).
MCL 766.11b irreconcilably conflicts with MCR 6.110(C) (providin g
that the Michigan Rules of Evidence apply at preliminary
examinations) because it permits the admission of evidence tha t
would be excluded under the Michigan Rules of Evidence. People v
Parker, 319 Mich App 664, 667 (2017). “MCL 766.11b is an enactmen t
of a substantive rule of evidence, not a procedural one. Accordingly,
the specific hearsay exception in MCL 766.11b takes precedenc e
over the general incorporation of the Michigan Rules of Evidence
found in MCR 6.110(C).” Parker, 319 Mich App at 674 (holding tha t
“[t]he district court properly admitted the laboratory report [of the
defendant’s blood draw at his preliminary examination on a charge
of operating while intoxicated] pursuant to the statutory hearsay
exception in MCL 766.11b,” and “[t]he circuit court abused its
discretion by remanding defendant’s case to the district court for
continuation of the preliminary examination”).
“The magistrate shall allow the prosecuting attorney or the defense
to subpoena and call a witness from whom hearsay testimony wa s
introduced under this section on a satisfactory showing to the
magistrate that live testimony will be relevant to the magistrate’ s
decision whether there is probable cause to believe that a felony ha s
been committed and probable cause to believe that the defendan t
committed the felony.” MCL 766.11b(2).
H. Hearsay as Basis to Form an Expert’s Opinion
Where “the facts and data underlying [an expert’s] testimony wer e
fundamentally presented in testimony, documents, and
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-53
Section 5.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
photographs admitted during [a] five-day trial,” the trial court di d
not err when it permitted the expert to rely on hearsay to formulate
a diagnosis where no hearsay exception applied. People v Alexander,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (holding that when “no hearsay
exception applied, an expert is allowed to recount and rely o n
hearsay if it was used as a basis to form an opinion”). In Alexander,
the prosecution’s expert witness “testified that prior to performing
her evaluations of [the minor child], she examined the minor child’ s
medical records, which included a number of photographs of [the
minor child’s] injuries and the results of [the minor child’s] x-ray
report, in addition to information provided by the forensi c
interviewer.” Id. at ___. The expert witness also interviewed a
codefendant and the defendant’s minor children. Id. at ___. “While
[the expert witness] opined that [the minor child’s] injurie s
indicated that the minor child was exposed to at least two distinc t
physical assaults and at least two psychological maltreatments,
warranting a diagnosis of ‘medical torture,’ she [explained that] her
diagnosis was a consequence of her review of the medical record s
admitted in evidence, which included photographs of the ligature
marks on [the minor child’s] extremities and an x-ray of the minor
child’s ankles.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the expert witness “wa s
permitted to advance testimony concerning the alleged abuse of [the
minor child] as her opinion was made on the basis of admitted
evidence detailing physical findings and [the minor child’s] medical
history, in addition to the minor child’s statements.” Id. at ___. “It i s
well-settled that an expert witness may rely on hearsay evidence
when the witness formulates an opinion.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted).
5.4 Negative Evidence
A. Generally
“Negative evidence is evidence to the effect that a circumstance or
fact was not perceived or that it was, or is, unknown. It is generally
of no probative value and, hence, inadmissible. However, a negative
response to a question does not necessarily constitute negative
evidence.” S C Gray, Inc v Ford Motor Co, 92 Mich App 789, 81 0
(1979) (citations omitted). Negative evidence is problematic because
it presents two conflicting inferences: (1) the event never occurred,
or (2) the event occurred but the witness did not perceive it. Dalton v
Grand Trunk Western R Co, 350 Mich 479, 485 (1957). The Dalton
Court went on to state that “[t]he mere fact of nonhearing, standin g
alone, ordinarily has no probative value whatever as to the
occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of the event.” Id. at 485. As a n
example, the Court cited the bombing of Pearl Harbor: most people
did not hear the bombing, but that does not mean the bombing did
Page 5-54 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 5.4
not occur. Id. at 485-486. Therefore, the party relying on the evidenc e
bears the burden of proving its probative value:
“[The party] must show the circumstances pertaining t o
the nonobservance, the witness’ activities at the time,
the focus of his attention, his acuity or sensitivity to th e
occurrence involved, his geographical location, th e
condition of his faculties, in short, all those physical an d
mental attributes bearing upon his alertness o r
attentiveness at the time.
* * *
[T]he weight to be accorded the testimony of a witness,
his credibility, whether or not his testimony i s
affirmative and convincing, rests with the jury.” Dalton,
350 Mich at 486.
B. Absence of Record
The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, “regardless of
whether the declarant is available as a witness:
* * *
(7) Absence of a Record of a Regularly Conducted
Activity. Evidence that a matter is not included in a
record described in [MRE 803(6)] if:
(A) the evidence is admitted to prove that the
matter did not occur or exist;
(B) a record was regularly kept for a matter of tha t
kind; and
(C) the opponent does not show that the possible
source of the information or other circumstance s
indicate a lack of trustworthiness.
* * *
(10) Absence of a Public Record. Testimony—or a
certification under [MRE 902]—that diligent searc h
failed to disclose a public record or statement if th e
testimony or certification is admitted to prove that:
(A) the record or statement does not exist; or
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-55
Section 5.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
(B) a matter did not occur or exist, if a public office
regularly kept a record or statement for a matter of
that kind.” MRE 803(7); MRE 803(10).
C. Examples
Testimony that there were no recorded reports of an allegation of
sexual assault was admissible under MRE 803(7) because it wa s
“relating to the absence of a matter . . . of a kind of which a
memorandum, report, record, or data compilation [is] regularly
made and preserved”; thus, “evidence that no report was ever made
was admissible to prove the nonoccurence or nonexistence of the
matter[.]” People v Marshall, 497 Mich 1023, 1023 (2015) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted; first alteration in original). Moreover,
the evidence was relevant under MRE 401 because the evidenc e
“was probative of the complainant’s credibility; specifically, the
complainant’s claim that she had reported the abuse to her school
teacher.” Marshall, 497 Mich at 1024.
Testimony that the location where the plaintiff fell had been used
for years without accident was inadmissible as negative evidence
because proving an absence of accidents does not tend to prove a n
absence of negligence. Larned v Vanderlinde, 165 Mich 464, 468 (1911).
“[M]ere testimony that a sound was not heard, by itself, does no t
present an issue of fact as to whether or not the sound existed. Suc h
‘negative evidence’ must be preceded by a showing that the witnes s
had been in a position to hear the sound if it occurred.” Beasley v
Grand Trunk Western R Co, 90 Mich App 576, 584 (1979) (citatio n
omitted). In Beasley, six witnesses testified that they did not hear a
train whistle or any other warning device, and one of the witnesse s
was “positive” that the train did not blow its whistle. Id. at 585. I n
light of these facts, the Court concluded that the evidence wa s
admissible as a question of fact for the jury to decide. Id. 585-586.

At the conclusion of a trial or hearing, the court must “direct the partie s
to retrieve the exhibits submitted by them[.]” MCR 2.518(B). However,
any weapons and drugs must be “returned to the confiscating agency fo r
proper disposition.” Id. If the parties do not retrieve their exhibits “a s
directed, within 56 days of the conclusion of the trial or hearing, the cour t
may properly dispose of the exhibits without notice to the parties.” Id.
“If the court retains discovery materials filed pursuant to MCR 1.109(D)
or an exhibit submitted pursuant to this rule after a hearing or trial an d
the material is confidential as provided by law, court rule, or court orde r
pursuant to MCR 8.119(I), the court must continue to maintain th e
material in a confidential manner.” MCR 2.518(C).
6.2 Chain of Custody
A. Foundation
An adequate foundation for the admission of proffered tangible
evidence must contain verification that the object was involved i n
the matter at hand and that the condition of the object i s
substantially the same. People v Prast (On Rehearing), 114 Mich App
469, 490 (1982). In evaluating the foundation presented, the trial
court should consider the nature of the object, the circumstance s
surrounding the preservation and custody of the object, and the
possibility of an individual tampering with the object while it is i n
custody. Id.
B. Break in the Chain of Custody
A court is not required to automatically exclude proffered evidence
because of a break in the chain of custody of the evidence. People v
Herndon, 246 Mich App 371, 405 (2001). A break in the chain o f
custody of the object affects the weight of the evidence, not it s
1See http://courts.michigan.gov/Administration/SCAO/Resources/Documents/standards/cf_stds.pdf.
Page 6-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 6.3
admissibility. People v Ramsey, 89 Mich App 260, 267 (1979). It is no t
an abuse of discretion to admit evidence where there are alleged
deficiencies concerning the collection and preservation of the
evidence as long as there is no missing vital link in the chain of
custody or there is no sign of tampering with the evidence. See
People v Muhammad, 326 Mich App 40, 59 (2018).
6.3 Demonstrative Evidence
“Demonstrative evidence is admissible when it aids the fact-finder i n
reaching a conclusion on a matter that is material to the case. Th e
demonstrative evidence must be relevant and probative. Further, whe n
evidence is offered not in an effort to recreate an event, but as an aid t o
illustrate an expert’s testimony regarding issues related to the event,
there need not be an exact replication of the circumstances of the event. ”
People v Bulmer, 256 Mich App 33, 35 (2003) (citations omitted).
If the evidence bears a “substantial similarity” to an issue of fact in th e
case, it may be admissible. Lopez v General Motors Corp, 224 Mich Ap p
618, 627-634 (1997). In Lopez, the trial court did not abuse its discretion i n
admitting two videotapes that depicted crash tests with condition s
similar to, but not exactly, like those of the accident at issue. Id. at 620,
625, 634-635. The Court noted the difference between re-creatio n
evidence and demonstrative evidence and when each type of evidence i s
appropriate, stating:
“[T]he distinction between demonstrative evidence and re-
creation evidence, and the standards of admission associated
with each, is important. When evidence is offered to show
how an event occurred, the focus is upon the condition s
surrounding that event. Consequently, it is appropriate tha t
those conditions be faithfully replicated. By contrast, whe n
the evidence is being offered not to re-create a specific event,
but as an aid to illustrate an expert’s testimony concerning
issues associated with the event, then there need not be a s
exacting a replication of the circumstances of the event.”
Lopez, 224 Mich App at 628 n 13 (citations omitted).
“The burden . . . is on the party presenting the evidence to satisfy th e
court that the necessary similar conditions exist.” Duke v American Olea n
Tile Co, 155 Mich App 555, 561 (1986).

6.4 Best Evidence Rule
A. Requirement of Original
“An original writing, recording, or photograph is required in orde r
to prove its content unless [the MREs] or a statute provide s
otherwise.” MRE 1002. In order for the best evidence rule to apply,
the contents of the evidence must be at issue. People v Lueth, 253
Mich App 670, 686 (2002).
Committee Tip:
Keep in mind that MRE 1001, et seq., concern
proof of the contents of a writing, recording, or
photograph, not necessarily their existence. As
such, the best evidence rule does not apply when
a party seeks to prove the existence of a writing,
recording, or photograph. See People v Tucker,
504 Mich 934, 936 (2019).
B. Photographs
In order to lay a proper foundation for the admission of
photographs, “someone who is familiar from personal observation
of the scene or person photographed [must] testif[y] that the
photograph is an accurate representation of the scene or person.
Photographs are admissible despite changes in the condition of the
scene or person where a person testifies as to the extent of the
changes.” In re Robinson, 180 Mich App 454, 460-461 (1989) (citations
omitted).
As with all evidence, the trial court has discretion to admit or
exclude photographs. People v Mills, 450 Mich 61, 76 (1995),
modified and remanded 450 Mich 1212 (1995). “Photographs are no t
excludable simply because a witness can orally testify about the
information contained in the photographs. Photographs may also be
used to corroborate a witness’ testimony. Gruesomeness alone need
not cause exclusion. The proper inquiry is always whether the
2 Because MRE 1002 is commonly referred to as the “Best Evidence Rule” in many Michigan courts, this
benchbook will also refer to the court rule as such. However, the common name may be misleading.
“[T]here is no hierarchy of evidence in Michigan and the best evidence rule only requires that the ‘original’
document be produced.” Baker v Gen Motors Corp, 420 Mich 463, 509 (1984).
Page 6-4 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 6.4
probative value of the photographs is substantially outweighed by
unfair prejudice.” Mills, 450 Mich at 76 (citations omitted).
In Mills, the victim was intentionally set on fire by the defendants ,
and the prosecution sought to introduce color slides depicting the
extent of the victim’s injuries. Mills, 450 Mich at 64, 68-69. The Cour t
found that the photographs were relevant under MRE 401 because
they “affect[ed] two material facts: (1) elements of the crime, and (2)
the credibility of witnesses.” Mills, 450 Mich at 69. Additionally, the
probative value of the slides was not substantially outweighed by
unfair prejudice because, despite their graphic nature, they were a n
“accurate factual representation[] of the [victim’s] injuries” and they
“did not present an enhanced or altered representation of the
injuries.” Id. at 77-78.
“Photographs that are relevant are not inadmissible merely because
they vividly depict shocking details.” In re Piland Minors, 336 Mic h
App 713, 734 (2021). Where “[o]ne of the disputes was whether,
prior to her death, [the decedent’s] jaundice improved,” autopsy
photographs “were highly probative as to how yellow [the
decedent] appeared before her death.” Id. at 733-734. “Th e
photographs, although taken after her death, depicted the
yellowness of her body, her eyes, and her gums. Expert testimony
supported that the yellow pigment shown in the photograph s
would not have increased after her death.” Id. at 733-734.
“[A] relevant photograph is not inadmissible merely because it may
arouse emotion,” and “[t]he prosecution is not obligated to use the
least prejudicial evidence possible.” People v Baskerville, 333 Mich
App 276, 288-289 (2020). “[T]he ‘unfairness’ of potentially
emotionally inflammatory evidence is mitigated when the
proponent lacks any less prejudicial way to establish a critical
issue.” Id. at 288. In Baskerville, the trial court properly admitted
photographs that “served as corroboration of [a witness’s]
testimony concerning what she observed and her own action s
during the incident, and also served as illustration and
corroboration for the testimony provided by an evidence technicia n
and the medical examiner.” Id. at 288-289 (the court was
“unconvinced that the emotional impact of the . . . photograph s
would have been appreciably diminished had they been rendered i n
black and white rather than in color,” and “[t]he prosecutor
explained that the color photographs were necessary for visual
‘clarity’”).
“[S]exually explicit photographs used as evidence of a sexual
assault of a minor cannot be unfairly prejudicial per se.” People v Brown,
326 Mich App 185, 194 (2019). “[T]rial courts must weigh the
prohibitive value against the danger of any unfair prejudice tha t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-5
Section 6.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
admission might cause. A decision on the admissibility of
photographs in such cases cannot be based solely on the graphi c
nature of the photographs.” Id. Although “shocking, indecent, an d
unsettling,” the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting
photos (located on defendant’s cellphone) that depicted the minor
victim’s vagina, breasts, and buttocks because the photos were
illustrative of the acts depicted and the propensities of the perso n
who took them (defendant), and they were also introduced for
purposes other than to merely shock or inflame the jurors. Id. at 193
(the trial court also vastly limited the number of photograph s
admitted at trial to those in which the victim could identify
defendant’s hands). The photographs “corroborate the victim’ s
testimony . . . because they [were] the only direct evidence
confirming any part of the victim’s testimony.” Id. at 194.
“Therefore, any prejudicial taint [was] more than overcome by their
probative value, regardless of how lurid and despicable the
photographs themselves [were].” Id.
“[T]he trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting . . .
photographs into evidence” where “the photographs . . .
corroborated testimony regarding the cause of the victim’s deat h
and the nature and extent of his fatal injuries” and “were helpful i n
establishing the mental state that the prosecutor was required t o
prove for some of the offenses.” People v Head, 323 Mich App 526,
541-542 (2018). “The nature and extent of [the victim’s] injurie s
revealed the powerful nature of the short-barreled shotgun and
were thus probative of defendant’s gross negligence and
recklessness in storing this loaded, deadly weapon in a place tha t
was readily accessible to his unsupervised children,” and
“[a]lthough some of the pictures may appear gruesome, their
admission into evidence was useful in establishing the mental state
that the prosecutor was required to prove, and gruesomeness alone
does not require exclusion.” Id. at 542.
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting
photographs of the victim lying in a hospital bed with a severely
bruised face and wearing a neck brace during the defendant’s trial
for aggravated domestic assault and assault with intent to do grea t
bodily harm less than murder. People v Davis, 320 Mich App 484,
487-489 (2017), vacated in part on other grounds 503 Mich 98 4
3
(2019). The photographs were “highly relevant and probative t o
establish an essential element of aggravated domestic assault,” and
“were not so prejudicial as to warrant exclusion under MRE 403”
because “the nature and placement of [the victim’s] bruises and
lacerations corroborated her testimony about the assault and
3For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
Page 6-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition Section 6.4
depicted the seriousness of her injuries.” Davis, 320 Mich App a t
488-489. Further, “[e]ven if the neck brace was ‘precautionary’ only,
as argued by defendant, this precaution was required by
defendant’s actions,” and “was part and parcel of the medical
treatment [the victim] received for injuries sustained after
defendant repeatedly punched her in the face.” Id. at 489.
In Robinson, the defendant challenged the admission of photograph s
taken twenty days after the victim died and after the victim had
been embalmed and buried, because they did not accurately depic t
the victim at the time of death. Robinson, 180 Mich App at 460. The
Court of Appeals concluded that admission was proper because
testimony established that, although the photographs did not depic t
the victim at the time of death, the trauma the victim suffered wa s
more likely to show after being embalmed and the photos did depic t
the victim at the time of the autopsy. Id. at 461 (noting that the exten t
of the bruises in the photographs were probative of malice).
C. Exceptions
MRE 1003–MRE 1007 provide exceptions to the best evidence rule.
However, because no published case law exists on MRE 1005 (copies
of public records) and MRE 1007 (testimony or statement of a
4
party), the rules themselves are quoted for reference purposes.
1. Admissibility of Duplicates
MRE 1003 permits the admission of duplicates, unless there ar e
genuine questions about the original’s authenticity or
admitting a duplicate make it unfair.
Admitting a true copy of a defendant’s default judgment of
divorce, for purposes of deciding whether to bind him over,
“was not inherently unfair . . . because it only served t o
establish that defendant was ordered to pay child support, a
fact that defendant [did] not contest.” People v Monaco, 26 2
Mich App 596, 609 (2004), rev’d in part on other grounds 47 4
5
Mich 48 (2006).
4 See Section 6.4(C)(3) and Section 6.4(C)(5).
5For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-7
Section 6.4 Evidence Benchbook - Revised Edition
2. Admissibility of Other Evidence of Contents
MRE 1004 does not require an original and provides tha t
“other evidence of the content of a writing, recording, o r
photograph is admissible if:
(a) all the originals are lost or destroyed, and no t
by the proponent acting in bad faith;
(b) an original cannot be obtained by any available
judicial process;
(c) the party against whom the original would be
offered had control of the original; was at that time
put on notice, by pleadings or otherwise, that the
original would be a subject of proof at the trial or
hearing; and fails to produce it at the trial or
hearing; or
(d) the writing, recording, or photograph is no t
closely related to a controlling issue.”
Where the defendant was charged with CSC-I, and testimon y
established that the defendant looked at child pornography o n
his computer before and during the sexual assaults, it wa s
proper to admit photographs from his computer that wer e
similar to, but not exactly like, those that the defendant looke d
at during the assaults. People v Girard, 269 Mich App 15, 18-1 9
(2005). In Girard, the defendant argued that admission of th e
images violated the best evidence rule because witnesse s
identified the images only “as being similar to the images the y
had seen on defendant’s computer.” Id. at 19. According to th e
Court, testimony about the computer images explained th e
circumstances under which the sexual assaults occurred, and
therefore, with regard to the CSC-I charges against th e
defendant, the images of child pornography found on th e
defendant’s computer were a collateral matter unrelated to a
controlling issue. Id. at 20. Therefore, the similar photograph s
were properly admitted against the defendant pursuant t o
6
MRE 1004(d). Girard, 269 Mich App at 20.
3. Public Records
“The proponent may use a copy to prove the content of a n
official record — or of a document that was recorded or filed in
a public office as authorized by law — if these conditions ar e
6The provision previously found in MRE 1004(4) now appears in MRE 1004(d). See ADM File No. 2021-10,

met: the record or document is otherwise admissible; and th e
copy is certified as correct in accordance with [MRE 902(4)
(self-authenticating evidence)] or is testified to be correct by a
witness who has compared it with the original. If no such copy
can be obtained by reasonable diligence, then the proponen t
may use other evidence to prove the content.” MRE 1005. Se e
Section 1.4 for information about judicial notice.
4. Charts, Diagrams, and Summaries
A summary, chart, or calculation may be used “to prove th e
content of voluminous writings, recordings, or photograph s
that cannot be conveniently examined in court.” MRE 1006.
“The proponent must make the originals or duplicate s
available for examination or copying, or both, by other partie s
at a reasonable time and place. And the court may order th e
proponent to produce them in court.” Id.
To be admissible under MRE 1006, the underlying material s
“must themselves be admissible” and the “summary must b e
an accurate summarization of the underlying materials.”
Hofmann v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 211 Mich App 55, 100 (1995)
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
5. Testimony or Written Admissions of Party
The content of a writing, recording, or photograph may be
proved “by the testimony, deposition, or written statement o f
the party against whom the evidence is offered.” MRE 1007.
“The proponent need not account for the original.” Id.
6.5 Loss of Evidence
