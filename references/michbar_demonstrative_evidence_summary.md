What it is:
- Trial practice article on demonstrative evidence admissibility and foundations.

Key points (high-level):
- Demonstrative evidence is admissible if it aids the fact‑finder and is substantially similar to the relevant issue.
- Foundation requirements depend on the exhibit type (photos, simulations, etc.).
- Highlights balancing relevance vs unfair prejudice.

Why it matters to CaseCompanion:
- Supports a “Demonstrative Exhibit Builder” and admissibility checklist for visuals created from video frames.
