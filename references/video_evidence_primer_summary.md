What it is:
- A DOJ/BJA primer (Oct 2016) on managing and admitting video evidence in court.
- Covers evidentiary foundations, format/codec issues, storage, and courtroom presentation.

Key points (high-level):
- Silent Witness Theory for authenticating video when no eyewitness can testify.
- Need for standardized, nonproprietary formats and clear playback preparation.
- Emphasis on documentation of handling, transfers, and processing.

Why it matters to CaseCompanion:
- Supports a Video Evidence Admissibility module (authentication theory + format guidance).
- Reinforces chain-of-custody and playback-readiness checklists.
