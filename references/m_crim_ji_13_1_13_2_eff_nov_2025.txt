                                FROM THE COMMITTEE
                                 ON MODEL CRIMINAL
                                  JURY INSTRUCTIONS

===========================================================
       The Committee on Model Criminal Jury Instructions has adopted amendments

to M Crim JI 13.1 (Assaulting, Resisting, or Obstructing a Police Officer or Person
Performing Duties) and M Crim JI 13.2 (Assaulting or Obstructing Officer or
Official Performing Duties). The amended instructions place more emphasis on the
requirement that the jury receive instructions on the legal framework for assessing
whether the officers’ actions were lawful. See People v Carroll, 514 Mich 851; 8
NW3d 576 (2024). Additionally, the references to “resisting” and “opposing” have
been removed from M Crim JI 13.2, as those terms do not appear in MCL 750.479.
The amended instructions are effective November 1, 2025.
