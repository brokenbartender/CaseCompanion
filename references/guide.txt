Welcome to Your Digital Lawyer Diary Guide!

This guide will walk you through the powerful features of the Digital Lawyer Diary, helping you manage your cases, tasks, and practice with
efficiency. Let's start with the first screen you see when you log in: the Dashboard.

1. The Dashboard: Your Command Center

Your dashboard is your mission control. It gives you a high-level, at-a-glance overview of your most critical information, from upcoming case dates
to your overall case load.

By default, your dashboard includes several informative widgets:
       Today & Tomorrow: Shows the number of cases scheduled for today and the next day.
       Status: A summary of your active and pending cases.
       Cases: A count of new cases added this week and this month.
       Archive & Summary: An overview of archived, decided, and total cases.
       Recent Cases: A list of your most recently updated cases for quick access.
       Your Tasks: A list of pending tasks and their deadlines.

The true power of the dashboard is its flexibility. You can completely personalize it to fit your workflow.

2. Personalizing Your Workspace: Customizing the Dashboard

Think of your dashboard as a set of building blocks (widgets). You can move, resize, add, or remove them to prioritize what's most important to you.

Step 1: Enter Customization Mode
To begin personalizing your layout, click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) located at the top right of the dashboard.

                                                                                          Page 2 of 87
You'll know you're in customization mode when a blue banner appears and your widgets have a dashed border.

Step 2: Rearrange and Resize Widgets

Once in customization mode, you can organize your workspace.
       To Move a Widget: Click and hold the widget, drag it to your desired location, and release.
       To Resize a Widget: Hover over the bottom-right corner of a widget until your cursor changes, then click and drag to make it larger or
       smaller.

                                                                                          Page 3 of 87
Step 3: Add and Remove Widgets

Tailor the dashboard to show only the information you need.
       To Remove a Widget: Click the red 'X' icon that appears at the top-right corner of any widget.

       To Add a Widget: Click the blue "+ Add Widget" button at the top of the screen. A dropdown menu will appear with a list of available
       widgets you can add back to your dashboard. Simply click on one to add it.

                                                                                          Page 4 of 87
Step 4: Save or Reset Your Layout

       Save: Once you are happy with your new layout, click the green "Done Customizing" button. Your personalized view is now saved!
       Reset: If you want to return to the original layout at any time, enter Customization Mode and click the "Reset to Default" link.

3. Quick Navigation: Accessing Case Details

Your dashboard widgets are not just for display; they are interactive. Clicking on a case title within the "Recent Cases" widget or any other case list
will take you directly to the detailed Case View page for that specific case.

This allows you to quickly jump from a high-level overview to in-depth case information without navigating through multiple menus.

4. Case Management: The Heart of Your Practice

The Cases module is your central repository for all case-related information, from court dates and case numbers to client details and attached
documents.
To get started, click on Cases in the main navigation menu on the left.

                                                                                          Page 5 of 87
4.1 The Cases List View

This is your main dashboard for all cases. It provides a comprehensive, sortable table of your entire caseload.

Here, you have several powerful tools at your disposal:
       Search Cases: Use the search bar at the top to instantly find a case by its title, case number, court name, or any other detail.
       Filter & Sort: Use the Filter by and Sort By buttons to narrow down and organize your case list precisely.
       Print Cause List: Click the Print button to generate a professional, printable PDF of your current case list. Before printing, you can filter the
       list (e.g., by date) to create a perfect cause list for a specific day or court.

       Customize: Click the Customize button to choose which columns are visible in your table, allowing you to see only the information that
       matters most.
       Calendar View: Click the Calendar View icon to see your cases plotted on a monthly calendar based on their "Next Date."

                                                                                          Page 6 of 87
4.2 Creating a New Case

Adding a new case is simple. From the Cases list view, click the "+ Create Case" button and fill out the comprehensive form, which includes sections
for Case Details, Contact Information, Additional Information (for fees and timesheets), and Attachments.
Step 1: From the Cases list view, click the "+ Create Case" button.

Step 2: Fill out the Create Case form. The form is divided into clear, collapsible sections.

                                                                                          Page 7 of 87
Case Details: Enter the core information like Office File Number, Court Case Number, Case Title, Type, Stage, Court Name, Judge Name,
and Next Date.
Contact Information: Link the case to existing contacts for your Client, the Opponent, and the Opponent's Lawyer.

                                                                                   Page 8 of 87
    Additional Information: This section is for financial tracking and time management. You can add Timesheet Entries, set the Case Fee and
    Charges, and log Payments received. The system will automatically calculate the Total and Remaining Fee.

         1760179185954
    Attachments: Drag and drop files directly into the upload area or click to select them from your computer. This is perfect for storing
    petitions, orders, and other relevant documents. (50 MB Limit Per Account) with more option for Enterprise accounts

‚ú® Pro Tip: On-the-Fly Entries For fields like Case Type, Stage, Judge, etc., you don't need to have everything pre-configured. Simply start typing a

new entry (e.g., a new Judge's name). If it doesn't exist, an "+ Add entry" option will appear. Click it to add the new option to your list permanently
without leaving the form!

                                                                                        Page 9 of 87
Step 3: Once all the information is entered, click the blue "Create Case" button at the bottom. You will be taken directly to the new case's "Case
View" page.

Customizing the "Create Case" Form
Your practice is unique, and so are your data needs. You can customize the Create Case form to hide fields you don't use.

       While on the "Create Case" page, click the Customize icon in the top-right corner.
       A "Customize Form" modal will appear. Uncheck any fields you don't need.
       Click "Save changes". The form will now be streamlined to your preference.

                                                                                          Page 10 of 87
---

4.3 The Case View Page: Your Digital Case File

After creating or clicking on an existing case, you'll land on the Case View page. This is the detailed file for a single case, containing all its
information in one place.

                                                                                          Page 11 of 87
Managing Hearing Dates
Keeping track of hearing dates is critical. Your Digital Diary makes this effortless.

       Viewing Dates: All upcoming and previous hearing dates are clearly listed in the Case Details tab.
       Adding the Next Date (Quick Add): The fastest way to schedule the next hearing is by using the Quick add button, located directly next
       to the "Next date" display. Clicking this opens a mini-calendar, allowing you to select the next date and add it instantly without needing to
       enter the full edit mode.

                                                                                          Page 12 of 87
The Case Actions Bar
At the top of the Case View page is a powerful action bar that lets you manage every aspect of the case.

       Edit: Click this to enter Edit Mode and update any case information.
       Status Dropdown (Active/Archived/Decided): Quickly update the case's current status.
       Copy, Delete, Privacy, Assign: Tools to duplicate, remove, set permissions for, or assign the case.
       Export: Generate a PDF of the case details, fees, or all information combined.
       History (Audit Trail): This is one of the most powerful features for accountability and tracking. Clicking History opens a window with a
       complete, timestamped log of every change ever made to the case.

               It shows when the change was made.
               It shows who made the change (by username).
               It shows exactly what was changed (e.g., "Case Name changed from '123' to '1234'").
               Download History: Inside the Case History window, click the download icon to export this complete log as a file for your records
               or for reporting purposes.
  Note: The Assign action draws from the Team Members you have already invited through the Associates module. If you don't see a colleague listed,
  invite them as an associate first and then return to assign the case.

                                                                                          Page 13 of 87
5. Invoice Management: From Billing to Paid

The Invoice module streamlines your entire billing process, allowing you to create professional invoices, track payments, and monitor your firm's
financial health at a glance.
To begin, click on Invoice in the main navigation menu.

5.1 The Invoice Dashboard

The main invoice page gives you a high-level financial overview and a detailed list of all your invoices.

                                                                                          Page 14 of 87
       Financial Summary: At the top, you'll find key metrics:
               Total Invoices: A count of all invoices ever created.
               Total Revenue: The total value of all invoices.
               Outstanding: The total amount of money that is yet to be paid across all unpaid invoices.
               Paid Invoices: The total number of fully paid invoices.

       Invoice List: A searchable and sortable table of every invoice. You can quickly see the Client Name, Issue Date, Due Date, Amount, and
       current Status (e.g., Draft, Paid, Partial).

5.2 Setting Up Your Invoices (First-Time Setup)

Before creating your first invoice, it's a great idea to customize it with your firm's branding.
Step 1: From the Invoice Dashboard, click the Settings button in the top-right corner.

                                                                                          Page 15 of 87
Step 2: Customize your invoice settings:
       Logo: Upload your law firm's logo. This will appear on every PDF invoice you generate.
       Currency: Select your primary currency (e.g., Rs (PKR)).
       Template: Choose a look and feel for your invoices. "Detailed" is a great professional option.
       Invoice Numbering:
               Enable Automatic Numbering to let the system generate sequential invoice numbers for you.
               Set an Invoice Prefix (e.g., INV ). The system will automatically add the year.
               Set the Next Invoice Number to start your sequence from a specific number (e.g., 1 or 101 ).

Step 3: Click Save Changes. Your invoices are now ready to be created with a professional, branded look.

5.3 Creating a New Invoice

Step 1: From the Invoice Dashboard, click the "+ Create Invoice" button.

                                                                                          Page 16 of 87
Step 2: Fill in the Core Details
       Client/Paralegal: Select the client you are billing from your contacts list.
       Associated Case (Optional but Powerful): Select the specific case this invoice is for. This will automatically link the invoice to the case file
       and can pre-fill other fields like Case Reference and Matter Type.
       Invoice & Due Date: Set the issue date and the date the payment is due.

Step 3: Add Line Items (Services and Charges) This is where you detail the services you are billing for.

                                                                                          Page 17 of 87
       In the Product Name field, select a service from your saved list (e.g., "Legal services") or type a new one and click **"+ Add entry 'New
       Service'" to save it for future use.
       Enter the Quantity (e.g., hours) and the Rate. The system automatically calculates the Amount.
       Add applicable Tax (%) if needed.
       Click the green checkmark to add the item to the invoice.
       You can add multiple line items (e.g., "Legal Services," "Stamp duty," "Photocopying Charges"). The system will keep a running Total.
Step 4: Add Notes and Finalize
       Add any payment instructions or notes for your client in the Notes text box.
       Review the final total and click the "Create Invoice" button.

                                                                                          Page 18 of 87
5.4 The Invoice View Page: Managing Payments and Actions

After creating an invoice, you are taken to its detailed view. Here you can track its status, record payments, and perform other actions.

Key Features:
       Status Banner: A prominent banner at the top shows the Amount Due and the due date. Its color indicates if it's current, due soon, or
       overdue.
                                                                                          Page 19 of 87
       Payment History: A table that logs every payment made against this invoice.
       Action Bar: At the top, you have several options:

               Print: Generate a professional PDF of the invoice.
               Duplicate: Create a new, identical invoice.
               Edit: Modify the invoice details.
               Delete: Remove the invoice.
Recording a Payment
Step 1: From the Invoice View page, click the blue "Make Payment" button.

Step 2: In the "Record Payment" pop-up:
       Enter the Payment Amount. You can enter a partial amount or the full amount.
       Select the Payment Date and Payment Method (e.g., Cash, Bank Transfer).
       Add an optional Reference number (like a check number or transaction ID).
       Click "Record Payment".

The invoice will instantly update:
       The Payment History will show the new payment.
       The Amount Due in the status banner will decrease.
       The invoice status will change from Draft to Partial (if partially paid) or Paid (if fully paid).
                                                                                          Page 20 of 87
5.5 Printing and Sharing Your Invoice

Step 1: From the Invoice View page, click the Print button.
Step 2: A professional, multi-page PDF will be generated and downloaded. This document is ready to be emailed or printed for your client. It
includes:

       Your firm's logo and contact details.
       The client's information.
       A clear breakdown of services and charges.
       A summary of the total amount, amount paid, and the final Balance Due.

                                                                                          Page 21 of 87
6. Managing Your Team: The Associates Module

Collaboration is at the core of a successful law firm. The Associates module allows you to securely invite your partners, junior lawyers, paralegals,
and other staff to your Digital Lawyer Diary workspace.
To get started, click on Associates in the main navigation menu.

6.1 The Associates Dashboard

This page is your central hub for managing everyone connected to your firm. It's divided into two main sections:

                                                                                          Page 22 of 87
       Active Team Members: This is a list of all associates who have accepted your invitation and are currently part of your firm. Each member is
       displayed on a card showing their name, role, and the number of cases they are assigned to.
       Pending Invitations You Sent: This section appears whenever you have an outstanding invitation. It helps you keep track of who has been
       invited but has not yet responded.
Keeping this list current ensures every Team Member picker throughout the app‚Äîincluding case assignments, invoicing, and project dashboards‚Äî
has the right people available.

6.2 Inviting a New Associate

Adding a new member to your firm is a simple, secure invitation-based process.
Step 1: From the Associates Dashboard, click the "+ Invite Associate" button in the top-right corner.
Step 2: The Invite Associate window will appear. Fill in the required details:

       Email Address: Enter the email address of the person you want to invite. They must have or create a Digital Lawyer Diary account with this
       email.
       Role: Specify their role within your firm (e.g., "Partner," "Senior Associate," "Paralegal"). This is for your organizational reference.

  What happens next? The system clearly explains the process: The person you invite will receive an email and a notification within their own Digital
  Lawyer Diary account. They will appear in your "Pending" list until they accept.

                                                                                          Page 23 of 87
Step 3: Click the "Send Invitation" button.

6.3 Managing Pending Invitations

Once the invitation is sent, a new card will appear under the "Pending Invitations You Sent" section.

This card shows the invitee's email, their assigned role, and a "Pending" status. You have two options here:
       Resend: If your associate hasn't seen the invitation, click this to send the invitation email again.
       Cancel Invitation: If you sent the invitation by mistake or no longer wish for them to join, click this to revoke the invitation.

6.4 What the Invitee Sees: Accepting the Invitation

Your team member will receive the invitation inside their own Digital Lawyer Diary account.
When they log in and navigate to their "Associates" page, they will see a pending invitation from your firm.

They have two choices:
       Accept: By clicking "Accept," they officially join your firm's workspace. They will then appear in your "Active Team Members" list, and the
       pending invitation will be removed.
       Decline: If they click "Decline," the invitation is rejected and removed.
                                                                                          Page 24 of 87
6.5 Managing Active Team Members

Once an associate has accepted your invitation, their card moves to the "Active Team Members" list.

From here, you can:
       Assign them to cases (as shown in the Case Management section).
       Manage their permissions by clicking the three-dot menu icon on their card. This allows you to edit their role or remove them from the
       firm if they leave your practice.

6.6 Assigning and Reviewing Cases

Each associate card includes a three-dot menu in the top-right corner. Use it to keep case assignments synchronized:
    1. Click Assign Cases to open the selection dialog.
    2. Search, filter, or scroll through the list, then select one or more matters to share with the associate.
    3. Choose Select Cases to Assign to confirm. The associate gains immediate access to those files.

Need to audit workloads later? Choose View Assigned Cases from the same menu to see everything currently shared with that team member‚Äî
including status and court details‚Äîwithout leaving the Associates module.

                                                                                          Page 25 of 87
Tip: Use Select All or Clear All inside the dialog to handle bulk reassignment when someone joins or leaves a matter.

7. Project Management: Organizing Your Legal Work

While the "Cases" module is perfect for litigation and court-related matters, the Projects module offers a flexible and powerful way to manage any
set of tasks with a defined workflow. This is ideal for internal firm initiatives, complex client matters that aren't in litigation (like a large merger or
contract review), or any work that benefits from visual task tracking.

To begin, click on Projects in the main navigation menu.

7.1 Creating a New Project

Step 1: From the main Projects page, click the "+ Create Project" button in the top-right corner.

Step 2: Fill out the New Project form.

                                        Page 26 of 87
       Project Details:
               Project Name: Give your project a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "ACME Corp Merger Due Diligence").
               Description: Use the rich text editor to provide a detailed overview of the project's goals, scope, and key information. You can use
               formatting like bold, lists, and links.

       Team Members: (Optional) You can add existing team members to the project right from the start. We'll cover adding members to an
       existing project later.
       Case Reference: (Optional) If this project is directly related to a formal case in your system, you can link them here for easy cross-
       referencing.
Step 3: Click the "Create Project" button.

7.2 The Project Dashboard: Your Mission Control

After creating your project, you'll be taken to its main dashboard. This is the central hub for everything related to this specific project.

                                                                                          Page 27 of 87
The dashboard is divided into two main areas:
       Left Panel (Project Overview): This gives you an at-a-glance summary of the project's health, including its status, task breakdown
       (Pending, Completed, Blocked), and a list of team members.
       Right Panel (Task Management): This is where you'll create, view, and manage all the individual tasks for the project.

7.3 Managing Project Tasks

A project is made up of tasks. Your Digital Diary gives you a flexible system to manage them.
Creating a Task

    1. From the Project Dashboard, click the "+ Add Task" button.
    2. Fill out the New Task form:

               Title & Description: Give the task a clear name and add details.
               Stage & Status: Define where the task is in your workflow (e.g., Stage: Strategy Planning , Status: Pending ).
               Due Date: Assign a deadline.
       Milestones: Break down a large task into smaller, trackable sub-tasks.
       Team Assignment: Assign the task to a specific team member.
  Note: Project assignees come from your Associates list. Make sure the colleague is added in the Associates module so they appear here.
    3. Click "Create Task".

Visualizing Your Tasks: The Kanban Board
The most powerful way to view your tasks is with the Kanban Board.

    1. Click the Kanban icon in the top-right of the task area.
    2. Your tasks will now be displayed as cards in columns. Each column represents a Stage in your project workflow.
    3. To update a task's stage, simply drag and drop the card from one column to another.

 ‚ú® Pro Tip: Need more room? Click Hide Details to collapse the left panel and maximize your Kanban workspace.

                                                                                          Page 28 of 87
You can also change how the Kanban board is grouped by using the "Group by" filter to organize columns by Status, Assignee, or Due Date.

7.4 Personalizing Your Workflow: Project-Specific Stages

Every project is different. A contract review has a different workflow than a property acquisition. Your Digital Diary allows you to customize the
workflow stages for each project individually without affecting any other project.
Step 1: On your Project Dashboard, find the "Team Members" widget on the left panel and click the "Edit Stages" button.

                                                                                          Page 29 of 87
Step 2: In the "Edit Project Stages" window, you can fully customize your workflow:
       Reorder Stages: Drag and drop the stages to match your real-world process.
       Edit a Stage: Click the pencil icon to rename a stage or change its color.
       Delete a Stage: Click the trash icon to remove a stage you don't need.
       Add a New Stage:
            1. Click "+ Add new stage".
            2. In the "Create New Status" pop-up, give your new stage a Name and select a Color.
            3. Click "Create Stage".

                                                                                          Page 30 of 87
Step 3: After making your changes, click "Save Stages".
Your Kanban board and the "Stage" dropdown in your tasks will now instantly update to reflect this new, custom workflow, for this project only.

7.5 Collaboration: Adding Members and Linking Cases

As the project evolves, you can easily manage your team and references.
       To Add Team Members: In the left panel, click the "+ Add Members" button in the Team Members widget to add more collaborators.
       To Link to a Case: If you didn't link a case during creation, you can do so at any time using the "Link to Case" widget in the left panel.

                                                                                          Page 31 of 87
Ì†ΩÌ≥± Mobile Guide

M1. The Dashboard: Your Command Center

Your dashboard is your mission control. It gives you a high-level, at-a-glance overview of your most critical information, from upcoming case dates
to your overall case load.

By default, your dashboard includes several informative widgets:
       Today & Tomorrow: Shows the number of cases scheduled for today and the next day.
       Status: A summary of your active and pending cases.
       Cases: A count of new cases added this week and this month.
                                                                                          Page 32 of 87
       Archive & Summary: An overview of archived, decided, and total cases.
       Recent Cases: A list of your most recently updated cases for quick access.
       Your Tasks: A list of pending tasks and their deadlines.
The true power of the dashboard is its flexibility. You can completely personalize it to fit your workflow.

M2. Personalizing Your Workspace: Customizing the Dashboard

Think of your dashboard as a set of building blocks (widgets). You can move, resize, add, or remove them to prioritize what's most important to you.

Step 1: Enter Customization Mode
To begin personalizing your layout, click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) located at the top right of the dashboard.

                                                                                          Page 33 of 87

       To Move a Widget: Click and hold the widget, drag it to your desired location, and release.
       To Resize a Widget: Hover over the bottom-right corner of a widget until your cursor changes, then click and drag to make it larger or
       smaller.

                                                                                          Page 34 of 87
Step 3: Add and Remove Widgets

Tailor the dashboard to show only the information you need.
       To Remove a Widget: Click the red 'X' icon that appears at the top-right corner of any widget.

                                                                                          Page 35 of 87
To Add a Widget: Click the blue "+ Add Widget" button at the top of the screen. A dropdown menu will appear with a list of available
widgets you can add back to your dashboard. Simply click on one to add it.

                                                                                  Page 36 of 87
Step 4: Save or Reset Your Layout

Once you've finished customizing your dashboard, you have two options:
       Save Your Changes: Click the "X" button in the top-right corner of the Customize Dashboard modal to close it and save your personalized
       layout. Your dashboard will now display exactly as you configured it.

     Reset to Default: If you want to start fresh and return to the original layout, click the reset icon (Ì†ΩÌ¥Ñ) located next to the "+ Add Widget"

       button at the top of the Customize Dashboard modal. This will restore all widgets to their default positions and sizes.

 Ì†ΩÌ≤° Tip: You can return to customization mode anytime by clicking the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) again to make further adjustments.

                                                                                          Page 37 of 87

documents.
To get started, click on Cases in the main navigation menu on the left.

M4.1 The Cases List View

This is your main dashboard for all cases. It provides a comprehensive, sortable table of your entire caseload.

                                                                                          Page 39 of 87
Here, you have several powerful tools at your disposal:
       Search Cases: Use the search bar at the top to instantly find a case by its title, case number, court name, or any other detail.
       Filter & Sort: Use the Filter by and Sort By buttons to narrow down and organize your case list precisely.
       Print Cause List: Click the Print button to generate a professional, printable PDF of your current case list. Before printing, you can filter the
       list (e.g., by date) to create a perfect cause list for a specific day or court.

                                                                                          Page 40 of 87

M4.2 Creating a New Case

Adding a new case is simple. From the Cases list view, click the "+ Create Case" button and fill out the comprehensive form, which includes sections
for Case Details, Contact Information, Additional Information (for fees and timesheets), and Attachments.
Step 1: From the Cases list view, click the "+ Create Case" button.

                                                                                          Page 42 of 87
Step 2: Fill out the Create Case form. The form is divided into clear, collapsible sections.
                                                                                          Page 43 of 87
Case Details: Enter the core information like Office File Number, Court Case Number, Case Title, Type, Stage, Court Name, Judge Name,
and Next Date.
Contact Information: Link the case to existing contacts for your Client, the Opponent, and the Opponent's Lawyer.

                                                                                  Page 44 of 87

 ‚ú® Pro Tip: On-the-Fly Entries For fields like Case Type, Stage, Judge, etc., you don't need to have everything pre-configured. Simply start typing a

  new entry (e.g., a new Judge's name). If it doesn't exist, an "+ Add entry" option will appear. Click it to add the new option to your list permanently
  without leaving the form!

Step 3: Once all the information is entered, click the blue "Create Case" button at the bottom. You will be taken directly to the new case's "Case
View" page.

                                                                                          Page 46 of 87

       While on the "Create Case" page, click the Add Custom Field icon in the top-right corner.
       A "Customize Form" modal will appear. Add any fields you need.

M4.3 The Case View Page: Your Digital Case File

After creating or clicking on an existing case, you'll land on the Case View page. This is the detailed file for a single case, containing all its
information in one place.

                                                                                          Page 48 of 87
Managing Hearing Dates
Keeping track of hearing dates is critical. Your Digital Diary makes this effortless.

       Viewing Dates: All upcoming and previous hearing dates are clearly listed in the Case Details tab.
       Adding the Next Date (Quick Add): The fastest way to schedule the next hearing is by using the Quick add button, located directly next
       to the "Next date" display. Clicking this opens a mini-calendar, allowing you to select the next date and add it instantly without needing to
       enter the full edit mode.

                                                                                          Page 49 of 87
Page 50 of 87
The Case Actions Menu
On mobile, case actions are accessible through a convenient three-dot menu (‚ãÆ) located in the top-right corner of the Case View page. Tap it to
reveal all available case management options.

                                                                                          Page 51 of 87
The actions menu includes:

       Edit: Opens the edit mode, allowing you to update any case information including case details, contacts, fees, and attachments.

       Duplicate: Creates an exact copy of the current case, perfect for similar cases with the same client or court. You can then modify the
       duplicated case as needed.

       Download: Generates and downloads a comprehensive PDF report of the case, including all case details, hearing dates, fees, and payment
       history. This is ideal for offline reference or sharing with clients.

       Share: Opens your device's native share menu, allowing you to quickly share case information via email, messaging apps, or other installed
       applications.

       History (Audit Trail): This is one of the most powerful features for accountability and tracking. Tapping History opens a window with a
       complete, timestamped log of every change ever made to the case.

                                                                                          Page 52 of 87
               It shows when the change was made
               It shows who made the change (by username)
               It shows exactly what was changed (e.g., "Case Name changed from '123' to '1234'")
               You can download the complete history log for your records or reporting purposes
       Assign To: Allows you to assign the case to team members within your firm. This enables collaborative case management where multiple
       lawyers or paralegals can access and update the same case file.
       Delete: Permanently removes the case from your system. Use this option with caution, as deleted cases cannot be recovered. A
       confirmation prompt will appear before deletion.

 Ì†ΩÌ≤° Tip: The Assign To option draws from the Team Members you have already invited through the Associates module. If you don't see a colleague

  listed, invite them as an associate first and then return to assign the case.
Managing Case Status
The case status is one of the most visible elements on the Case View page, displayed as a colored badge just below the case title. Keeping your case
status up-to-date helps you organize your practice and quickly identify which cases need attention.

                                                                                          Page 53 of 87
To Change the Case Status:

    1. Tap the Status Badge - Look for the status badge displaying the current status (e.g., "Active" with a green background) located below the
       case title

    2. Select New Status - A dropdown menu will appear with three status options:

       ‚úì Active - The case is currently ongoing and requires regular attention. This is the default status for new cases.

               Archived - The case is completed or inactive, but you want to keep it in your system for reference. Archived cases can be easily
               filtered out from your active caseload.
               Decided - The case has received a final judgment or decision from the court. Use this status for closed cases with final outcomes.

    3. Status Updates Instantly - As soon as you select a new status, the badge color will change to reflect the update, and the change will be
       saved automatically.

                                                                                          Page 54 of 87
Status Color Guide:

     Ì†ΩÌø¢ Active - Green background (ready for action)
     Ì†ΩÌ¥µ Archived - Blue/Gray background (stored for reference)
     Ì†ΩÌø£ Decided - Purple background (finalized)
 Ì†ΩÌ≤° Pro Tip: Use the status filter in the Cases List View (M4.1) to quickly view only active cases, archived cases, or decided cases. This helps you focus

  on what matters most at any given time.

M5. Invoice Management: From Billing to Paid

The Invoice module streamlines your entire billing process, allowing you to create professional invoices, track payments, and monitor your firm's
financial health at a glance.

       displayed on a card showing their name, role, and the number of cases they are assigned to.
       Pending Invitations You Sent: This section appears whenever you have an outstanding invitation. It helps you keep track of who has been
       invited but has not yet responded.

has the right people available.

M6.2 Inviting a New Associate

Step 1: From the Associates Dashboard, click the "+ Invite Associate" button in the top-right corner.

  Lawyer Diary account. They will appear in your "Pending" list until they accept.
Step 3: Click the "Send Invitation" button.

M6.3 Managing Pending Invitations

Once the invitation is sent, a new card will appear under the "Pending Invitations You Sent" section.
                                                                                          Page 74 of 87

       Cancel Invitation: If you sent the invitation by mistake or no longer wish for them to join, click this to revoke the invitation.

M6.4 What the Invitee Sees: Accepting the Invitation

Your team member will receive the invitation inside their own Digital Lawyer Diary account.
When they log in and navigate to their "Associates" page, they will see a pending invitation from your firm.

                                                                                          Page 75 of 87
They have two choices:

       pending invitation will be removed.
       Decline: If they click "Decline," the invitation is rejected and removed.

M6.5 Managing Active Team Members

Once an associate has accepted your invitation, their card moves to the "Active Team Members" list.

                                                                                          Page 76 of 87
From here, you can:

       Assign them to cases (as shown in the Case Management section).
       Manage their permissions by clicking the three-dot menu icon on their card. This allows you to edit their role or remove them from the
       firm if they leave your practice.

Each associate card includes a three-dot menu in the top-right corner. Use it to keep case assignments synchronized:

    1. Click Assign Cases to open the selection dialog.
    2. Search, filter, or scroll through the list, then select one or more matters to share with the associate.
    3. Choose Select Cases to Assign to confirm. The associate gains immediate access to those files.
Need to audit workloads later? Choose View Assigned Cases from the same menu to see everything currently shared with that team member‚Äî

                                                                                          Page 77 of 87
including status and court details‚Äîwithout leaving the Associates module.

  Tip: Use Select All or Clear All inside the dialog to handle bulk reassignment when someone joins or leaves a matter.

M7. Project Management: Organizing Your Legal Work

While the "Cases" module is perfect for litigation and court-related matters, the Projects module offers a flexible and powerful way to manage any
set of tasks with a defined workflow. This is ideal for internal firm initiatives, complex client matters that aren't in litigation (like a large merger or
contract review), or any work that benefits from visual task tracking.
To begin, click on Projects in the main navigation menu.

                                                                                          Page 78 of 87

After creating your project, you'll be taken to its main dashboard. This is the central hub for everything related to this specific project.

                                                                                          Page 80 of 87
The dashboard is divided into two main areas:

Left Panel (Project Overview): This gives you an at-a-glance summary of the project's health and configuration:

       Project Status: Shows whether the project is Active, On Hold, or Completed. Click to change status.
       Total Tasks: Quick count of all tasks in this project.
       Task Status Breakdown:

               PENDING - Tasks not yet started (shown in blue)
               COMPLETED - Finished tasks (shown in green)
               BLOCKED - Tasks waiting on dependencies (shown in red)
       Last Updated: Timestamp showing when the project was last modified.
       Link to Case: Connect this project to an existing case for coordination. If no cases are available, you'll see "No cases available to link yet."
       Team Members: View all collaborators on this project. Use the "+0" button to add new members or the "Edit Stages" button to

                                                                                          Page 81 of 87
       customize the workflow stages.
Right Panel (Task Management): This is where you'll create, view, and manage all the individual tasks for the project:

       Use "+ Add Task" to create new tasks
       Search tasks... bar to quickly find specific tasks
       Sort dropdown to organize tasks by different criteria
       Filter by Status or Assignee to focus on specific task subsets
       The main area displays all your tasks with their details, including stage indicators, descriptions, milestone progress, and assignment status.

M7.3 Managing Project Tasks

A project is made up of tasks. Your Digital Diary gives you a flexible system to manage them.
Creating a Task

    1. From the Project Dashboard, click the "+ Add Task" button in the Tasks section.
    2. Fill out the New Task form with the following information:

                                                                                          Page 82 of 87
Task Information:

       Title: Give the task a clear, descriptive name (required).
       Description: (Optional) Add detailed context, notes, or instructions. Supports both Edit and Preview modes for formatted text.
       Stage: Select the workflow stage for this task (e.g., Intake & Assessment , Documentation & Filing ). The available stages
       are specific to this project and can be customized.
       Status: Set the current status (e.g., Pending , In Progress , Completed , Blocked ).
       Due Date: (Optional) Assign a deadline to keep the task on track.

Team Assignment:

       Assign To: (Optional) Assign the task to a specific team member. The dropdown will show "No team members available" if you
       haven't added any associates to your firm yet.

  Note: Project assignees come from your Associates list. Make sure the colleague is added in the Associates module before they can appear
                                                                                  Page 83 of 87
          here.
       Milestones:

               Break down large tasks into smaller, trackable sub-tasks or milestones.
               Click "+ Add" to create new milestones.
               Check off milestones as they're completed to track progress.
    3. Click "Create Task" to add the task to your project.
The new task will appear in your Tasks list and can be filtered, sorted, and organized by Status or Assignee.

M7.4 Personalizing Your Workflow: Project-Specific Stages

Every project is different. A contract review has a different workflow than a property acquisition. Your Digital Diary allows you to customize the
workflow stages for each project individually without affecting any other project.
By default, each new project comes with a standard legal matter workflow that includes the following stages:

       Intake & Assessment - Initial client consultation and case evaluation
       Documentation & Filing - Preparing and filing necessary documents
       Hearings & Negotiations - Court proceedings and settlement discussions
       Resolution & Follow-up - Final resolution and post-case activities
However, you can fully customize these stages to match your specific project needs.
Step 1: On your Project Dashboard, find the "Team Members" widget on the left panel and click the "Edit Stages" button.

                                                                                          Page 84 of 87
Step 2: In the "Edit Project Stages" window, you can fully customize your workflow:
                                                                                          Page 85 of 87
Reorder Stages: Drag and drop the stages using the handle (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ) icon to match your real-world process. The first stage in the list becomes
the default column on the Kanban board.

Edit a Stage: Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to rename a stage or change its color. Each stage can have a distinct color for easy visual

identification:
       Yellow - typically for initial/preparation phases
       Orange - for active work phases
       Green - for completion/resolution phases

Delete a Stage: Click the trash icon (Ô∏è) to remove a stage you don't need.

Add a New Stage:
    1. Click "+ Add new stage" at the bottom of the stage list.
    2. In the "Create New Status" pop-up, give your new stage a Name and select a Color.
    3. Click "Create Stage".

                                                                                  Page 86 of 87
Step 3: After making your changes, click "Save Stages".
  Important Notes:
          Changes apply only to this project and won't affect other projects.
          Renaming or reordering stages refreshes the workflow on the next load.
          Removed stages will move their tasks to the default stage (the first stage in your list) when the board reloads.

Your Kanban board and the "Stage" dropdown in your tasks will now instantly update to reflect this new, custom workflow, for this project only.

M7.5 Collaboration: Adding Members and Linking Cases

As the project evolves, you can easily manage your team and references.
       To Add Team Members: In the left panel, click the "+ Add Members" button in the Team Members widget to add more collaborators.
       To Link to a Case: If you didn't link a case during creation, you can do so at any time using the "Link to Case" widget in the left panel.

M8. Install as Mobile App (PWA)

Install the Digital Lawyer Diary as a Progressive Web App so it behaves like a native mobile app, launches full-screen, and stays one tap away from
your homescreen.

M8.1 Install on Android (Chrome)

    1. Open the Digital Lawyer Diary in Chrome and verify you are signed in.
    2. Tap the three dots menu in the upper-right corner of Chrome.
    3. Choose Add to Home screen (or Install app on newer Android versions).
    4. Confirm the suggested name, then tap Add. Chrome will place the icon on your home screen or let you drag it where you want it.
    5. Launch the new icon once so Android records the app in your recent apps list.

M8.2 Install on iOS (Safari)

    1. Open Safari and navigate to the Digital Lawyer Diary while logged in.
    2. Tap the Share icon (square with an upward arrow) at the bottom of the screen.
    3. Scroll the sheet and tap Add to Home Screen.
    4. Edit the shortcut name if desired, then tap Add in the top-right corner.
    5. Return to your home screen and launch the new icon to use the diary in a standalone window.

M8.3 Manage the App Experience

       Keep at least one login active so the PWA opens directly without re-entering credentials; the standard session timeout rules still apply.
       Allow notifications when prompted to receive reminders for hearings, invoices, and task updates just like in the browser.
       If the interface looks outdated, open the menu and select Reload (Android) or pull down to refresh (iOS) to fetch the latest version.
       To uninstall, remove the homescreen icon; Android will also prompt you to clear the stored data.
Congratulations! You now have access to all the power of your Digital Lawyer Diary, both on desktop and mobile. Whether you're in court, at the
office, or on the move, your entire practice is at your fingertips.
