Title:
- "A Comprehensive Framework for Reliable Legal AI: Combining Specialized Expert Systems and Adaptive Refinement"

Key ideas (high-level):
- Proposes a reliability framework for legal AI that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KG), Mixture of Experts (MoE), and RLHF.
- Emphasizes reliability, reduced hallucinations, and explainability for legal tasks.
- Benchmarks across multiple legal tasks and datasets; highlights that different tasks benefit from different components (e.g., KG for structured extraction, RLHF for open-ended tasks).

Why it matters to CaseCompanion:
- Reinforces our grounding-first design and evidence-bound outputs.
- Supports a modular approach where different tasks (evidence extraction vs. narrative drafting) use different AI pipelines.
