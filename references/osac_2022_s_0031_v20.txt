4 Summary
4.1 The digital video examination workflow includes the following three domains:
assessment, processing, and analysis. The general workflow and procedures used in each domain
may be the same regardless of the evidence submitted by the requestor.
4.2 Assessment tasks involve the review of the submitted items for suitability for
examination, determination of the region(s) of interest, and the preparation of a working copy.
4.3 Processing tasks involve the production of deliverable output products or intermediate
products.

4.4 Analysis tasks involve the interpretation of information extracted from the submitted
items to answer the questions posed in the requested examination.

5 Significance and Use

5.1 The workflow and task domains presented in this standard create a consistent framework
upon which forensic video service providers can structure their services, division of duties, and
operating procedures.

5.2 A given examination may not require the performance of tasks from all of the domains
described.

5.3 Depending on one's training, an individual forensic science practitioner could be
authorized to perform tasks from one or more of these domains.

6 Assessment Domain of Forensic Digital Video Examination Workflow

6.1 Actions performed during the Assessment of video evidence are the foundational steps
necessary before implementing the Processing or Analysis workflows, or both, which are listed
later in this standard. The assessment workflow is as follows:

6.1.1 Review the request to determine that it is technically feasible, that it can be accomplished
by the forensic service provider, and that the required resources are available.

6.1.2 A working copy of the evidence shall be created and verified through a hashing function.
If hashing is not possible, the reason shall be documented. Once the working copy is verified, it
shall be used in lieu of the submitted evidence throughout the assessment, processing, and
analysis.

6.1.3 An initial technical overview of the video file should be performed, and any issues should
be documented.

6.1.3.1 A technical overview of the video file(s) should be performed to determine display
attributes relevant to processing and analysis such as display resolution, pixel aspect ratio, frame
rate, and codec.

6.1.3.2 It is recommended that multiple tools be used for the technical overview of file
properties. Technical observations about the video and any discrepancies in the reported results
should be documented and evaluated. It is recommended to evaluate discrepancies in reported
results by manually parsing and decoding a file's binary data.

6.1.4 In order to view the video, a proprietary video player, specific codec, or additional
equipment may be required.

6.1.5 If it becomes apparent during the assessment that an earlier generation of the recording
may exist (e.g., through file metadata, indication of a conversion process), contact the requestor.

                                                          7
                                                                                               OSAC 2022‐S‐0031

6.1.5.1 If the original or best quality recording is not provided, document that fact and inform the
requestor of any known limitations imposed on the examination.

6.1.6 Discrepancies between the observations of the submitted video and the details provided
should be documented by the forensic science practitioner. Discrepancies preventing the
fulfillment of the examination should be reviewed with the requestor.

6.1.7 Additional details and documentation that may assist in the assessment of the video
should be requested. For example, documentation on the initial recovery of digital video
evidence may provide additional information such as the recording device’s time offset and
device settings.

6.1.8 Assessing areas or regions of interest can be based on both temporal and spatial
information. When confirming the area or regions of interest for processing and analysis, the
following should be considered:

6.1.8.1 There may be relevant information contained within the video outside the requested
events of interest (e.g., clocks, signs, potential witnesses, bystanders). If found, the relevance of
such information can be determined by the requestor and the forensic science practitioner.

6.1.9 Any audio present in the video should be handled properly and reviewed to obtain
relevant additional details. See SWGDE Best Practices for Forensic Audio for recommendations
on a forensic audio workflow.

6.1.9.1 Handling and processing of audio may require specific audio training. See SWGDE Core
Competencies for Forensic Audio.

7 Processing Domain of Forensic Digital Video Examination Workflow

7.1 Actions performed while processing video include procedures to transform input media
to output media. For example, processing includes tasks to transcode, enhance, restore, carve
video data, and perform timeline sequence reconstruction. These actions could lead to tasks
performed in the Analysis Domain of this workflow.

7.2 If the submitted video cannot be processed in its original format, it may be necessary to
produce a converted file via transcoding or screen capturing. Steps to preserve the original video,
particularly frame rate, resolution, pixel values, and detail, should be taken regardless of the
technique used. If more than one option for transcoded export is available, all options should be
evaluated to determine which best preserves the information relevant to the examination.

7.2.1 See SWGDE’s Technical Overview of Digital Video Files for additional information on the
foundation of knowledge of file formats, encoding standards, and compression algorithms used
in digital video.

7.3 Transcoding is the conversion of multimedia from one format or encoding method to
another. This includes decoding, demultiplexing, exporting still images and video, and screen
capturing of still images and video.

                                                          8
                                                                                               OSAC 2022‐S‐0031

7.3.1 Transcoding is intended to change only the encoding form, not the content of the data.
However, the results of certain processes, such as compression, can affect the content. Video
resulting from transcoding should fairly and accurately represent the visual contents of the
original video.

7.3.1.1 The output of different transcoding types and the use of different playback systems may
need to be compared to determine which will provide the best representation of the original
video.

7.3.2 Discrepancies between the input video and output video shall be documented.

7.3.3 The preferred techniques for transcoding are lossless. These techniques include:

7.3.3.1 Transferring original bitstream data into a new container. This technique, commonly
known as re‐wrapping, preserves the video bitstream but might remove or alter some metadata
contained in the original video container. For example, creation times or frame timing
information may be changed as a result of the transcoding process. Containers might interact
differently with various video data and not all containers will support all media codecs.

7.3.3.2 Carving video bitstream data. Video data carving is the extraction of a video bitstream
from a larger data structure. For additional details, See SWGDE Fundamentals of H.264 Coded
Video for Examiners.

7.3.3.3 Converting the video file. This technique would change the video stream into an
uncompressed or lossless video format.

7.3.4 Transcoding to lossy formats:

7.3.4.1 Transcoding video to a lossy format must be avoided if the video is to be used for further
analysis. If extenuating circumstances prevent this, clearly document reasoning, and ensure
transcoded video is an accurate representation of the original content.

7.3.4.2 Transcoded media used for review and not for analysis may use a lossy format as
necessary. This may be due to video length or storage limitations. Ensure the transcoded media
is an accurate representation of the original content.

7.3.4.3 The reason for the use of a lossy format should be documented. For example, a lossy
format would be acceptable if a proprietary player is the only option and will only export in a
lossy format.

7.3.5 Some proprietary video players may provide an option to save in a different format from
the original video. If none of the preferred transcoding techniques are available, choose the
transcoding option that best preserves the quality of the original video. For example, sequential
still images in a lossless format may be exported and used to produce a video.

7.3.5.1 Verify and document any visible differences or degradation from what was displayed in
the proprietary video player.

                                                                                               OSAC 2022‐S‐0031

7.3.6 Screen capturing may be used if it provides the best quality output.
7.3.6.1 When screen capturing video, settings should be chosen to best maintain the
characteristics of the original video (e.g. aspect ratio, resolution) and prevent dropped frames.
7.4 Additional processing techniques such as Enhancement and Restoration, are used to
improve the visibility of details in digital video or still images.
7.4.1 Guide E2825 outlines common image enhancement techniques.
7.5 Guide E2825 outlines image restoration techniques that can also be used for video, such
as blur removal, color balancing, grayscale linearization, and geometric restoration.
7.6 Additional techniques commonly used in video processing which are not included in
Guide E2825 include:
7.6.1 Adjusting the orientation of video content.
7.6.2 Adjusting the frame rate of video.
7.6.3 Stabilizing techniques to fix the position of an area of interest.
7.6.4 Techniques to deinterlace frames of video.
7.6.5 Deblocking techniques to reduce the artifacts caused by block‐based compression
algorithms.
7.6.6 Signal adjustments such as applying a spatial frequency‐based filter to reduce pattern
noise.
7.6.7 Techniques for adjusting scale and aspect ratio.
7.7 Avoid the introduction of artifacts that can add misleading information to the file or the
loss of detail such as clipped pixels or ringing artifacts.
7.8 Timeline Sequence Reconstruction involves relating still images and video to each other
and other relevant data to develop chronological and contextual relationships among events.
7.8.1 Analysis as described in Section 8 may be required to determine the relevant information.
7.9 Enhancement and restoration techniques shall be documented in a manner to permit a
comparably trained forensic science practitioner to understand the steps taken, the techniques
used, and to extract comparable information from the processed file.

8 Analysis Domain of Forensic Digital Video Examination Workflow

8.1 The analysis domain includes the application of specific subject matter expertise to
interpret data from video evidence and draw opinions2 regarding the question of interest.

8.1.1 Refer to the OSAC 2022‐S‐0001, Standard Guide for Image Comparison
Conclusions/Opinions, for additional details regarding opinion categories that may be reached by
a forensic practitioner performing comparisons of people, objectives, or scenes captured in
images (e.g., face, vehicle clothing, skin detail), regardless of the process by which opinions are
reached.

8.2 Categories of video analysis: Authentication, Photogrammetric Analysis, Content Analysis,
and Comparative Analysis.

8.2.1 Authentication: the process of substantiating that the data is an accurate representation
of what they are purported to be. Refer to OSAC 2021‐S‐0036, Standard Guide for Image
Authentication.

8.2.2 Photogrammetric analysis: the process of obtaining dimensional information regarding
objects and people depicted in video. Refer "SWGDE Best Practices for the Forensic Use of
Photogrammetry" for specific methodologies.

8.2.3 Content Analysis: forming results, interpretations, or both. Targets for content analysis
include, but are not limited to, the subjects/objects within a video; the conditions under which,
or the process by which, the video was captured or created; the physical aspects of the scene,
such as lighting or composition, or the provenance of the video. Refer to SWGDE Best Practices
for Image Content Analysis.

8.2.4 Comparative Analysis: the assessment of the correspondence between features in still
images and known objects or images for the purpose of rendering an opinion regarding
identification, elimination, or a qualified conclusion. Refer to OSAC 2022‐S‐0001 Standard Guide
for Image Comparison Conclusions/Opinion and SWGDE Best Practice for Photographic
Comparison for All Disciplines.

2 There is a movement in the forensic community to eliminate the word “conclusion” from the
formal set of words that describe forensic processes. For example, ISO does not use the word
“conclusion”. This is reflected by the Organization of Scientific Area Committees for Forensic
Science (OSAC) preference to use the term “opinion” (defined as View, judgment, belief – takes
into consideration other information in addition to observations, data, calculations, and
interpretations).
