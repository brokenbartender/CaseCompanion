Artificial intelligence (“AI”) is transforming the legal industry at a remarkable pace and
now plays a practical, everyday role in law firms across the globe. Whether automating
routine tasks, conducting advanced legal research, or enhancing client services, AI has
the potential to reshape how legal professionals operate. However, with numerous AI
platforms and tools available, selecting the right solution for your law firm can feel
overwhelming. This guide aims to simplify that decision and provide a brief overview of
popular GenAI tools used by attorneys.

Benefits and Uses

We will begin with looking at some of the benefits of AI in your practice:

    • Increased Efficiency: AI tools can significantly enhance the efficiency of legal
         practices by automating routine tasks and expediting otherwise complex
         processes. For example, AI-powered document review systems can analyze
         vast volumes of information in a fraction of the time it would take a human,
         freeing up time to focus on other tasks.

    • Improved Accuracy: The precision of AI tools in handling data and performing
         analyses is unparalleled. AI systems can meticulously organize and manage
         critical and voluminous documents (such a medical records or voluminous expert
         reports).

    • Cost Savings: By automating labor-intensive tasks, AI tools contribute to
         significant cost savings for law firms. The reduction in "man hours" required for
         tasks like document review and data analysis allows firms to allocate resources
         more effectively.

    • Enhanced Research Capabilities: AI-powered research tools, such as Westlaw
         Co-Counsel and Filevine, provide attorneys with advanced capabilities to conduct
         comprehensive legal research. These tools can quickly sift through extensive
         legal databases to identify relevant case law, statutes, and legal precedents,
         empowering attorneys with the information needed to build compelling
         arguments. Additionally, AI systems can assist in generating helpful information
         for aspects of cases such as demand letters, which are crucial in settlement
         negotiations.

    • Better Client Service: AI tools enhance client service by improving
         communication and responsiveness. For example, AI systems can track
         communications, ensuring that follow-ups and action items are noted for future
         tasks. This proactive approach to case management can simplify tasks and
         improve client relationships.

    • Practical Applications: AI tools can be used to assist in the performance of
         tasks common to most law practices. For instance, AI-powered systems can
         assist in scheduling and managing deadlines, reducing the risk of missed
         deadlines, and ensuring compliance with court requirements.

The specific areas where AI appears to be making the largest impact in the legal field:

                                                                                                                    2
    • Legal Research: AI can swiftly scan extensive case law databases, statutes,
         and regulations. These tools can pinpoint the most relevant results based on
         context, thereby saving hours of manual effort. Advanced AI can even identify
         patterns and suggest related issues that a manual search might miss.

    • Document Review: Discovery is among the most time-consuming aspects of
         litigation. AI tools can efficiently classify, tag, and extract key information from
         thousands of documents. Predictive coding and Technology Assisted Review
         (TAR) alleviate the burden on attorneys while enhancing accuracy. Some
         platforms also offer sentiment analysis and redaction automation.

    • Contract Review and Analysis: AI platforms can analyze contracts to highlight
         missing clauses, pinpoint risks, and ensure regulatory compliance. These tools
         assist attorneys in reducing review time from hours to minutes and support things
         like version comparisons and clause libraries.

    • Litigation Prediction: AI tools leverage data analytics to predict litigation
         outcomes, judge behaviors, and opposing counsel strategies. This enhances
         strategy development and client counseling by enabling firms to tailor arguments,
         set settlement expectations, and determine venue decisions based on data-
         driven insights.

    • Client Communication and Intake: Chatbots and virtual assistants can handle
         client inquiries, schedule appointments, and collect initial information. Several
         tools are specifically designed for legal applications and can integrate with
         systems to enhance client onboarding and ensure consistent engagement.

    • Billing and Time Tracking: AI can automate time entry, suggest billing codes,
         and identify billing inefficiencies. Several tools offer AI-driven timekeeping
         features that automatically track time spent on calls, emails, and document
         editing, ensuring more accurate and complete billing.

Strategy for Use of AI

A successful AI adoption strategy starts with clearly understanding your firm's unique
needs. Some important factors you may consider:

    • Practice Area: Different legal practices require different AI functionalities. For
         example, personal injury attorneys may focus on client intake and case
         management, while intellectual property firms may prioritize document search
         and pattern recognition for prior art. Employment law firms might benefit from
         compliance monitoring and real estate attorneys from automated deed and title
         reviews.

    • Firm Size and Structure: A solo attorney or small firm may prefer cloud-based,
         low-cost solutions that require minimal IT support, while a large firm with an IT
         department might invest in a robust on-premises AI platform with advanced
         analytics, user permissions management, and multi-office integration.

    • Case Volume and Complexity: High-volume firms will benefit more from
         automation and document analysis tools that reduce manual labor and human
         error. Complex litigation firms might prioritize advanced legal analytics and

                                                                                                                    3
         collaborative features to support multi-lawyer teams working on high-stakes
         cases.
    • Client Expectations: Are your clients demanding faster turnarounds or more
         detailed analytics? Tech-savvy clients may expect online portals, real-time
         updates, and transparency in billing, all of which AI-driven solutions can support
         or enhance.
    • Budget Constraints: Determine how much your firm can invest in financial
         resources and personnel training. Account for the upfront costs of licenses or
         subscriptions and long-term expenses related to maintenance, upgrades, and
         user training.

When comparing AI platforms, keep an eye on these key capabilities:

    • Customizability: Your platform should adapt to your firm's workflows, not vice
         versa.

    • Data Security and Compliance: Ensure the platform meets strict data
         protection standards. Features like role-based access, audit trails, and encryption
         should be standard.

    • User Experience: Choose platforms with an intuitive interface and clear user
         documentation. Consider platforms that provide visual workflows, searchable
         help centers, and embedded support tools to reduce training time.

    • Scalability: Ensure the platform can grow as your firm expands. It should be
         able to accommodate more users, larger data sets, and additional functionalities
         without a performance drop.

Additionally, key evaluation criteria should include:

    • Industry Experience: Does the vendor specialize in legal tech? Have they
         worked with firms like yours? Look for vendors who demonstrate domain-specific
         knowledge and an understanding of legal workflows.

    • Client Reviews and References: Look for third-party reviews, testimonials, and
         case studies that address performance and customer satisfaction. Peer feedback
         is often the most reliable predictor of vendor success.

    • Customer Support: Evaluate training, onboarding resources, and technical
         support availability. Live chat, helpdesk tickets, and dedicated account managers
         can make a big difference during implementation and troubleshooting.

    • Contract Terms: Avoid long-term lock-ins, automatic renewals, or unclear
         pricing structures. Flexible, short-term contracts are often preferable during initial
         deployment.

    • Trial Period: Insist on a pilot program. Run the platform through real-world
         scenarios to evaluate ease of use, output accuracy, and compatibility with firm
         processes.

AI solutions for law firms range widely in cost. Typical cost consideration models
include:

                                                                                                                    4
    • Subscription-Based: Flat-rate pricing per user/month. Suitable for small to mid-
         sized firms that need predictable budgeting. Often includes tiered features and
         user access levels.

    • Usage-Based: Fees are based on the volume of documents processed or hours
         used. Suitable for litigation or project-based firms that require flexibility and
         expect fluctuations in workload.

    • Enterprise Licensing: Large firms may negotiate enterprise-wide agreements
         with custom features, support, and implementation services. These often involve
         significant upfront investment but lower per-user costs.

    • “Freemium” Pricing: Some platforms offer free core features and charge for
         advanced tools like analytics, automation, or premium integrations.

When considering pricing, you should do a cost-benefit analysis and consider things like
time saved, hourly wage savings and client satisfaction. Choosing the right AI platform
for your law firm is more than a technology decision—it’s strategic. By understanding
AI's capabilities, evaluating your firm’s needs, and comparing features and vendors, you
can set your practice up for long-term success.

Key Ethical Considerations

In choosing to incorporate AI into a legal practice it is important to consider ethical
obligations and platform security. Law firms using AI must prioritize ethical considerations
and ensure AI is used responsibly. Because AI technology relies on algorithms to analyze
vast amounts of data, depending on the type of data it draws from, the results can be
biased. Relying on biased information can impact outcomes which can be especially
detrimental for the legal community. Accuracy is another significant issue when using AI.
It is often the top barrier preventing many lawyers from adopting AI into their practice.
Accordingly, you want to be cautious. For example, confirm the accuracy of legal citations
and fact check any sources of information before incorporating them into your documents.

When using AI technology, lawyers need to ensure that AI systems adhere to strict data
privacy regulations. Additionally, you would want to make sure that data is only used for
the specific purpose for which it was collected. Lawyers must always consider
professional obligations relating to privacy and information-sharing when using
information with AI systems to ensure that are not in breach of confidentiality obligations
or otherwise disclosing information improperly.

Lawyers are ultimately responsible for information and any errors that may appear with
the use of AI. As a result, lawyers must be proactive in establishing clear lines of
responsibility and accountability when implementing AI in their firm. The best rule of
thumb is to use AI technology as a complement to your work product, not a replacement.
In so doing, lawyers will be able to enjoy AI’s transformative benefits while maintaining
an ethical practice. While AI can streamline time-consuming tasks, it is under no
circumstances a replacement for a lawyer’s training, wisdom and judgement. For more
information regarding ethical duties and considerations of AI in for your law practice, see
