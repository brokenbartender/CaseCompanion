Whether the contract was modified by the parties depends on their intent as shown by their words, whether written or oral, or their conduct.  In this case, the parties agree that they entered into a contract. </p><p class="Instructions" id="458293">[ <span style="font-style:Italic;">Name of party</span> ] claims that after this contract was made, the parties agreed to change the terms of the original contract.  To find that the terms of the original contract were changed, you must decide that there is clear and convincing evidence that&#x3A;</p><p class="Instructions" id="458294">(a) there was a mutual agreement to modify or waive the terms of the original contract, and</p><p class="Instructions" id="458295">(b) unless the agreement to modify or waive the contract was in writing signed by [ <span style="font-style:Italic;">name of party being sued on contract</span> ], that [ <span style="font-style:Italic;">name of party</span> ] gave consideration in exchange for the modification and that [ <span style="font-style:Italic;">name of party being sued on contract</span> ] agreed to the change in the terms of the original contract. </p><p class="Instructions" id="458296">If you decide this was shown by clear and convincing evidence, then the parties changed their original contract and they are bound by the contract as modified.</p><p class="Instructions" id="458297">Otherwise, the parties did not change their original contract.</p><p class="Instructions" id="458298">&#x2A; The fact there was a written modification or anti&#x2D;waiver clause in the original contract does not bar the parties from modifying or waiving those clauses.  [ <span style="font-style:Italic;">Name of party claiming there was an amendment</span> ] must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parties intended, as shown by their words or conduct, to modify or waive the modification or anti&#x2D;waiver clause as well.</p><p class="History_Heading" id="458300">Note on Use</p><p class="Instructions" id="458301">This instruction should be accompanied by M Civ JI 8.&#x30;1, Meaning of Burden of Proof, which defines clear and convincing evidence.
