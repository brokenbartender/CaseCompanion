If the nonconformity of [ an installment &#47; one or more of the installments ] substantially impaired the value of the whole contract, then there is a breach of the whole contract.</p><p class="Instructions" id="451519">If you determine that the buyer was not entitled to reject [ an installment &#47; one or more of the installments ], then the buyer has breached the contract.</p><p class="History_Heading" id="451521">Note on Use</p><p class="Instructions" id="451522">&#x2A;Use the sentence in parentheses if applicable to the case.</p><p class="Instructions" id="451523">&#x2020;If the contract defines substantial impairment, or the contract or surrounding circumstances imply specific requirements as to quality, time, quantity, assortment, or the like, then these portions of the instruction may have to be modified.
