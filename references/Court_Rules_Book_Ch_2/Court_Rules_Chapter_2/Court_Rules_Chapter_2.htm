On motion of either party, on its own initiative, or at the request of the jury, the court may order a jury view of property or of a place where a material event occurred. The parties are entitled to be present at the jury view, provided, however, that in a criminal case, the court may preclude a defendant from attending a jury view in the interests of safety and security. During the view, no person, other than an officer designated by the court, may speak to the jury concerning the subject connected with the trial. Any such communication must be recorded in some fashion.</p><p class="L1_Letters" id="1007031">(K)<span style="padding-right:5pt ;">&#8203</span>Juror Discussion. In a civil case, after informing the jurors that they are not to decide the case until they have heard all the evidence, instructions of law, and arguments of counsel, the court may instruct the jurors that they are permitted to discuss the evidence among themselves in the jury room during trial recesses. The jurors should be instructed that such discussions may only take place when all jurors are present and that such discussions must be clearly understood as tentative pending final presentation of all evidence, instructions, and argument.</p><p class="L1_Letters" id="1007032">(L)<span style="padding-right:8pt ;">&#8203</span>Closing Arguments. After the close of all the evidence, the parties may make closing arguments. The plaintiff or the prosecutor is entitled to make the first closing argument.

The court may impose reasonable time limits on the closing arguments.</p><p class="L1_Letters" id="1007033">(M)<span style="padding-right:4pt ;">&#8203</span>Summing up the Evidence. After the close of the evidence and arguments of counsel, the court may fairly and impartially sum up the evidence if it also instructs the jury that it is to determine for itself the weight of the evidence and the credit to be given to the witnesses and that jurors are not bound by the court&#x2019;s summation. The court shall not comment on the credibility of witnesses or state a conclusion on the ultimate issue of fact before the jury.</p><p class="L1_Letters" id="1007034">(N)<span style="padding-right:5pt ;">&#8203</span>Final Instructions to the Jury.</p><p class="L2_Number_1" id="1007035">(1)<span style="padding-right:8pt ;">&#8203</span>Before closing arguments, the court must give the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit written requests for jury instructions. Each party must serve a copy of the written requests on all other parties. The court must inform the parties of its proposed action on the requests before their closing arguments. After closing arguments are made or waived, the court must orally instruct the jury as required and appropriate, but at the discretion of the court, and on notice to the parties, the court may orally instruct the jury before the parties make closing arguments. After jury deliberations begin, the court may give additional instructions that are appropriate.</p><p class="L2_Numbers" id="1007036">(2)<span style="padding-right:8pt ;">&#8203</span>Solicit Questions about Final Instructions. As part of the final jury instructions, the court shall advise the jury that it may submit in a sealed envelope given to the bailiff any written questions about the jury instructions that arise during deliberations.

The question shall be read into the record, and the attorneys shall offer comments on an appropriate response. The court may, in its discretion, provide the jury with a specific response to the jury&#x2019;s question, but the court shall respond to all questions asked, even if the response consists of a directive for the jury to continue its deliberations.</p><p class="L2_Numbers" id="1007038">(3)<span style="padding-right:8pt ;">&#8203</span>Copies of Final Instructions. The court shall provide a written copy of the final jury instructions to take into the jury room for deliberation. Upon request by any juror, the court may provide additional copies as necessary. The court, in its discretion, also may provide the jury with a copy of electronically recorded instructions.</p><p class="L2_Numbers" id="1007039">(4)<span style="padding-right:8pt ;">&#8203</span>Clarifying or Amplifying Final Instructions. When it appears that a deliberating jury has reached an impasse, or is otherwise in need of assistance, the court may invite the jurors to list the issues that divide<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#160;</span>or confuse them in the event that the judge can be of assistance in clarifying or amplifying the final instructions.</p><p class="L1_Letters" id="1007040">(O)<span style="padding-right:5pt ;">&#8203</span>Materials in the Jury Room. The court shall permit the jurors, on retiring to deliberate, to take into the jury room their notes and final instructions.

I</span>f, after beginning deliberation, the jury requests a review of certain testimony or evidence that has not been allowed into the jury room under subrule (O), the court must exercise its discretion to ensure fairness and to refuse unreasonable requests, but it may not refuse a reasonable request. The court may make a video or audio recording of witness testimony, or prepare an immediate transcript of such testimony, and such tape or transcript, or other testimony or evidence, may be made available to the jury for its consideration. The court may order the jury to deliberate further without the requested review, as long as the possibility of having the testimony or evidence reviewed at a later time is not foreclosed.</p><p class="Rule_Heading" id="1007043"><a id="19_Rule_Heading_1007043" name="19_Rule_Heading_1007043"></a>Rule 2.514 Rendering Verdict</p><p class="L1_Letter_A" id="1007044">(A)<span style="padding-right:6pt ;">&#8203</span>Majority Verdict; Stipulations Regarding Number of Jurors and Verdict.
