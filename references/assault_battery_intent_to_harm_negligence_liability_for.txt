     ASSAULT AND BATTERY - INTENT TO HARM - NEGLIGENCE - LIA-
BILITY FOR INJURY TO AN ALLERGIC PERSON - Defendant's agent conducted
in plaintiff's store a demonstration of a fly-spray, manufactured by another
company, intending to interest plaintiff in retailing it. The spray was placed in
an electric difusor which gave off a fly-killing vapor. Plaintiff's wife, unknown
to defendant, was allergic to pyrethrum, an ingredient of the spray, and became
violently ill upon coming in contact with the vapor. An action for assault and
battery was brought. Held, defendant was not liable in the absence of an intent
to do harm. Brabazon v. loannes Bros. Co., (Wis. 1939) 286 N. W. 21.

    An intent to do harm is not always a requisite in an action for assault and
battery. There is even some authority to the effect that recovery may be had
where defendant is merely acting negligently and plaintiff is injured thereby,1-
but most courts refuse to extend the battery concept this far.2 On the other
hand, recovery is generally allowed without regard to defendant's actual intent
when he is acting "in reckless disregard of consequences" 3 or is engaging in an
unlawful act.~ The meaning of the term "unlawful act" is incapable of a limited
definition, but in the light of the cases it is apparent that in its use in battery
actions, the courts are referring to unlawful acts which are likely to result in
bodily harm. In the principal case, assuming the demonstration was a trespass 5
and hence unlawful, harm was not likely to result from such an act and it would
therefore not fall within this category. The requirement of an intent to do harm
imposed by the court is apparently due to (I) the court's steadfast adherence
to an old concept of the requirement for a simple assault,° although the better
view today is that defendant need only intend to inflict a harmful or offensive
touching, or to put plaintiff in apprehension of such a touching; 1 and ( 2) a
confusion of this requirement for a simple assault with the requisite for a com-

pleted battery.8 The diversity of authority and resultant uncertainty which
pi'rvades the whole battery field could be eliminated by confining the term
"battery" to instances where defendant has intentionally invaded plaintiff's
right to freedom from harmful and offensive touchings, thereby leaving unin-
tentional invasions of that right to the negligence field.9 "Intentional invasions"
should, however, be construed to comprehend not only cases where defendant
actually intends a harmful or offensive touching, but also instances where he
acts "in reckless disregard of consequences" or merely intends an unlawful act
which is likely to result in bodily harm. In such cases, the required touching is

sufficiently probable for the law to imply an intent for its infliction. In the light

of these principles, the court in the principal case rightly rejected the battery
claim, but its summary requirement of an intent to do harm was too narrow.
Nor could plaintiff have recovered in a negligence action.10 It is generally held
that where defendant is using or selling an ordinarily non-injurious article, such
as fly-spray, hair dye, dyed furs, or eyeglass frames, there is no duty owed by

him to use due care to avoid harming plaintiff unless (I) he knew that persons
had previously been adversely affected by the use of such an article,11 or ( 2) he

could have inferred from the surrounding facts that plaintiff was peculiarly
sensitive to an ingredient of his article.12 There was no evidence in the principal
case to support either of these possibilities. An injury suffered by an allergic
person due to his peculiar sensitiveness, therefore, unless shown to have been
incurred under one of these circumstances, is damnum absque injuria.

      8 Donner v. Graap, 134 Wis. 523, u5 N. W. 125 (1908). That a distinction
should be made is pointed out in Hoffman v. Eppers, 41 Wis. 251 (1876); Vosburg
v. Putney, 80 Wis. 523, 50 N. W. 403 (1891).

      10 This possibility was not alleged by plaintiff and therefore did not have to be
discussed by the court, but it is of sufficient interest and importance to merit attention
herein.
