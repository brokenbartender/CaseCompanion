MDCR SUMMARY — Case #662239
Cody E. McKenzie vs. Liberty Bar & Poutinerie (LBP Entertainment Group LLC)
1. Unsafe Workplace Conditions & Employer Negligence
Assault Incident (08/20/2025)
While working as a bartender, you were physically assaulted by a customer, Jeffery Joseph Snyder, after intervening to protect a female patron he was attacking. You sustained a right‑shoulder injury during the assault.
Failure to Intervene
Management was present during the incident but did not intervene, assist, or take any steps to protect you from physical harm.
Negligent Safety Protocols
A MIOSHA complaint filed on January 3, 2026 documents that the employer had no workplace‑violence protocols, no safety training, and no procedures for handling violent customers.
Medical Negligence
After the injury, management discouraged you from seeking medical care and refused to document the incident as a workplace injury, violating basic employer obligations.
2. Retaliation & Discrimination After the Injury
Adverse Treatment
After reporting the injury, you experienced hostility, increased scrutiny, and disregard for your medical needs.
Termination Timeline
You were terminated via text message on October 17, 2025, less than 24 hours after submitting a written wage complaint. The termination message stated it was done “per advice of counsel.”
Retaliatory Basis
Your termination followed multiple protected activities:
reporting a workplace injury
requesting workers’ compensation compliance
requesting payment of unpaid wages
This sequence strongly supports a retaliation finding.
3. Denial of Rights, Benefits, & Protections
Workers’ Compensation Violations
The employer failed to file the required WC‑100 report. You were forced to file the WC‑117 yourself on January 2, 2026, months after the injury.
Wage Theft
Between June/September and October 2025, you worked 415.52 hours without pay.
Total unpaid wages are estimated at $15,920.68, including base wages and salary.
Benefit Disruption
The employer’s refusal to report the injury and the retaliatory termination caused instability that affected:
your UIA claim
your housing stability
your ability to access medical care
