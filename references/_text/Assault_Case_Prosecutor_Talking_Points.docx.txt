Prosecutor Talking Points
Defendant: Jeffery Snyder
Victims: Cody McKenzie and Shelby Herron
Incident Date: August 20, 2025
Location: Liberty Bar, Pontiac, MI
1. Opening Summary
I’m here because both Shelby and I were assaulted by Jeffery Snyder. The entire sequence — the assault on Shelby, the assault on me, the restraint, the admission, the kicking, and the escalation — is captured on two separate videos. I have full documentation, medical records, timelines, and witness statements organized and ready for review.
2. Key Evidence
Direct Admission:
On video, Snyder says: “I threw my drink on her.”
He never denies punching Shelby.
Assault on Me:
He kicks backward into my lower body while restrained.
He violently twists and kicks again in the second video, breaking the restraint.
Failure to Retreat:
After breaking free, he stands directly next to the exit but refuses to leave.
He turns back toward us and screams aggressively.
Witness Corroboration:
Shelby asks a bystander: “I need you to watch this, please.”
Multiple witnesses were present.
Victim Behavior:
Shelby is visibly shaken and seeking help.
I remain calm, controlled, and repeatedly reference self‑defense and waiting for police.
