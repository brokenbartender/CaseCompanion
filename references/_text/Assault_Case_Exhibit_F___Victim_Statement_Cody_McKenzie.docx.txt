Victim Impact Statement
Case Name: State of Michigan v. Jeffery Joseph Snyder
Case Number: 2025‑251105SM‑SM
Court: 50th District Court, Pontiac, MI
Judge: Hon. Jeremy Darnell Bowie
Victim: Cody McKenzie
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE BOWIE:
On August 20, 2025, while working as a bartender at Liberty Bar, I became the victim of a violent assault committed by Jeffery Snyder. I am submitting this statement to explain how this incident has affected me physically, emotionally, and financially.
When Mr. Snyder attacked a female patron and close friend of mine, I stepped in to protect her. During the struggle, there was a moment where everything went black. I lost awareness of my surroundings and only remember coming back to myself while holding him down on the floor. That blackout moment has stayed with me. It was the first time I felt genuinely unsafe in a place where I was supposed to be in control.
Physical Impact
After the assault, I went to the Emergency Room at Trinity Health Oakland. I was diagnosed with a right shoulder contusion and prescribed Robaxin, Naproxen, and later Xanax to manage both the physical pain and the anxiety that followed. For weeks, even simple movements were painful. I still experience discomfort that reminds me of what happened that night.
Emotional and Psychological Impact
The emotional impact has been significant. Before this incident, I was confident and comfortable handling crowds and high‑energy environments. Since the assault, I’ve dealt with anxiety, panic symptoms, and hypervigilance. Sudden movements, raised voices, or even normal bar noise can trigger intense stress. I now rely on medication to manage these symptoms. The sense of safety I once had in my workplace has been replaced with fear and uncertainty.
Financial and Life Impact
This assault also caused serious financial harm. I missed work, lost income, and was ultimately fired shortly after the incident — not because of my performance, but because I reported unpaid wages and stood up for myself after being injured. Losing my job while recovering from an assault created instability that affected every part of my life. Even though Medicaid covered the ER visit, I still had out‑of‑pocket costs, transportation expenses, and the financial strain of being suddenly unemployed.
Closing
I did not provoke this situation. I was simply doing my job and trying to protect someone who was being harmed. The consequences of Mr. Snyder’s actions have affected my physical health, my emotional well‑being, and my financial stability. I respectfully ask the Court to consider the full impact of this assault when determining restitution and sentencing.
Thank you for taking the time to hear my statement.
Respectfully,
Cody McKenzie
