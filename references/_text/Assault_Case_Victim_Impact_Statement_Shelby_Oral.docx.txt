Your Honor, on August 20th, 2025, I was assaulted by Jeffery Snyder while I was sitting at the bar with a friend. He became angry after we told him we weren’t interested in talking to him. He threw a drink on us, and before I could react, he punched me multiple times in the face. I remember feeling shocked and overwhelmed, and parts of the incident are still a blur to me.
Since that night, I’ve dealt with fear, anxiety, and a loss of confidence in public places. I used to feel comfortable going out with friends, but now I’m constantly on edge around strangers, especially in crowded environments. Loud voices or sudden movements make me tense up, and I’ve had trouble sleeping because I keep replaying what happened.
Physically, I had bruising, broken nails, and soreness for days, but the emotional impact has lasted much longer. I still feel the effects of being attacked without warning, and it has changed how I move through the world.
I didn’t provoke this situation. I was simply out with a friend, and his actions caused harm that I’m still dealing with. I ask the Court to consider the impact this has had on my safety and well‑being.
Thank you, Your Honor.
