Note on Precedential Value
“A panel of the Court of Appeals must follow the rule of law established by a
prior published decision of the Court of Appeals issued on or after November 1,
1990, that has not been reversed or modified by the Supreme Court, or by a
special panel of the Court of Appeals as provided in this court rule.” MCR
7.215(J)(1).
Several cases in this book have been reversed, vacated, or overruled in part and/
or to the extent that they contained a specific holding on one issue or another.
Generally, trial courts are bound by decisions of the Court of Appeals “until
another panel of the Court of Appeals or [the Supreme] Court rules otherwise[.]”
In re Hague, 412 Mich 532, 552 (1982). While a case that has been fully reversed,
vacated, or overruled is no longer binding precedent, it is less clear when a n
opinion is not reversed, vacated, or overruled in its entirety. Some cases state tha t
“an overruled proposition in a case is no reason to ignore all other holdings in the
case.” People v Carson, 220 Mich App 662, 672 (1996). See also Stein v Home-Owner s
Ins Co, 303 Mich App 382, 389 (2013) (distinguishing between reversals in thei r
entirety and reversals in part); Graham v Foster, 500 Mich 23, 31 n 4 (2017) (becaus e
the Supreme Court vacated a portion of the Court of Appeals decision, “tha t
portion of the Court of Appeals’ opinion [had] no precedential effect and the trial
court [was] not bound by its reasoning”). But see Dunn v Detroit Inter-Ins Exch, 25 4
Mich App 256, 262 (2002), citing MCR 7.215(J)(1) and stating that “a prior Court of
Appeals decision that has been reversed on other grounds has no precedential
value. . . . [W]here the Supreme Court reverses a Court of Appeals decision on
one issue and does not specifically address a second issue in the case, no rule of
law remains from the Court of Appeals decision.” See also People v James, 32 6
Mich App 98 (2018) (citing Dunn and MCR 7.215(J)(1) and stating that th e
decision, “People v Crear, 242 Mich App 158, 165-166 (2000), overruled in part o n
other grounds by People v Miller, 482 Mich 540 (2008), . . . [was] not binding”).
Note that Stein specifically distinguished its holding from the Dunn holding
because the precedent discussed in Dunn involved a reversal in its entirety while
the precedent discussed in Stein involved a reversal in part.
The Michigan Judicial Institute endeavors to present accurate, binding preceden t
when discussing substantive legal issues. Because it is unclear how subsequen t
case history may affect the precedential value of a particular opinion, trial court s
should proceed with caution when relying on cases that have negative
subsequent history. The analysis presented in a case that is not binding may still
be persuasive. See generally, Dunn, 254 Mich App at 264-266.
Michigan courts are bound by “our state Supreme Court precedent unless the
United States Supreme Court has addressed a federal constitutional question.”
People v Beasley, 239 Mich App 548, 559 (2000). “A plurality opinion of the United
v
=== Page 6 ===
States Supreme Court, however, is not binding precedent.” Id., citing Texas v
Brown, 460 US 730, 737 (1983).
“‘The clear rule in Michigan is that a majority of the [Michigan Supreme] Cour t
must agree on a ground for decision in order to make that binding precedent for
future cases.’” People v Sexton, 458 Mich 43, 65 (1998), quoting People v Anderson,
389 Mich 155, 170 (1973). See MCR 7.315(A) (“Except for affirmance of action by a
lower court or tribunal by even division of the justices, a decision of the Cour t
must be made by concurrence of a majority of the justices voting.”). “Plurality
decisions in which no majority of the justices participating agree as to the
reasoning are not an authoritative interpretation binding . . . under the doctrine of
Stare decisis.” Negri v Slotkin, 397 Mich 105, 110 (1976). However, a pluralit y
“decision rendered by less than four justices who nevertheless constitute a
majority of a legally constituted quorum is binding on the Court of Appeals and
the trial courts.” Id. at 106. “‘If there is merely a majority for a particular result,
then the parties to the case are bound by the judgment but the case is no t
authority beyond the immediate parties.’” Sexton, 458 Mich at 65, quoting
Anderson, 389 Mich at 170. In other words, “plurality opinions in which n o
majority of the participating justices agree with respect to the reasoning for the
holding are not generally considered authoritative interpretations that are
binding under the doctrine of stare decisis.” Auto Club Group Ins Co v Booth, 28 9
Mich App 606, 613 (2010).

Using This Benchbook
The purpose of this benchbook is to provide a single source to addres s
civil issues that may arise while the judge is on the bench. The benchboo k
is designed to be a quick reference, not an academic discussion. In tha t
context, one of the most difficult challenges is organizing the text so tha t
the user can readily find any topic as it arises.
This book has underlying themes that may assist the user to understand
the overarching concepts around which the book is organized. This boo k
is based upon the following concepts:
• The focus is on process rather than substantive law
although substantive law is discussed when important or
necessary to decision-making and the process as a whole.
• The text covers the routine issues that a judge may face and
non-routine issues that require particular care when the y
arise.
• The text is intended to include the authority the judg e
needs to have at his or her fingertips to make a decision.
• The text is designed to be read aloud or incorporated into a
written decision.
• The text identifies whether the court’s decision i s
discretionary (note the standard of review languag e
provided for most sections).
With these concepts in mind, the text is organized as follows:
• The format generally follows the sequence of the Michiga n
Court Rules and the Michigan Rules of Evidence.
• The format generally follows the typical sequence in whic h
issues arise during the course of a case.
• At the beginning of each chapter is a table of contents tha t
lists what is covered in the chapter.
• Sections in each chapter are identified by the word or
phrase typically used to identify the topic (a keyword
concept).
vii
=== Page 8 ===
• The discussion of each topic is designed to move from th e
general to the specific without undue elaboration.
• Every effort has been made to cite the relevant Michiga n
law using either the seminal case or the best curren t
authority for a body of law. United States Supreme Cour t
decisions are cited when Michigan courts are bound by tha t
authority and they are the original source.
• Every effort has been made to cite the source for eac h
statement. If no authority is cited for a proposition, then th e
statement is the committee’s opinion.
The Michigan Judicial Institute (MJI) was created in 1977 by th e
Michigan Supreme Court. MJI is responsible for providing educational
programs and written materials for Michigan judges and cour t
personnel. In addition to formal seminar offerings, MJI is engaged in a
broad range of publication activities, services, and projects that ar e
designed to enhance the professional skills of all those serving in th e
Michigan court system. MJI welcomes comments and suggestions. Pleas e

Section 1.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
1.1 Access to Court Proceedings
A. Open or Closed Trial
Generally, all trials must be open to the public. MCL 600.1420.
However, “for good cause shown, [the court may] exclude from the
courtroom other witnesses in the case when they are not testifying
and may, in actions involving scandal or immorality, exclude all
minors from the courtroom unless the minor is a party or witness.”
Id. MCL 600.1420 does not apply to cases involving national
security. Id.
In addition, the United States Constitution affords certain publi c
trial rights in civil cases: “[A] member of the public can invoke the
right to a public trial under the First Amendment. People v Vaughn,
491 Mich 642, 652 (2012) (distinguishing between the public’s righ t
to a public trial under the First Amendment and a criminal
defendant’s right to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment).
The right to a public trial includes the right to public voir dire
proceedings, pretrial hearings, and the jury selection process. Presley
v Georgia, 558 US 209, 212-216 (2010); Waller v Georgia, 467 US 39, 43-
47 (1984); Vaughn, 491 Mich at 650-652. “The public-trial right als o
protects some interests that do not belong to the defendant.” Weaver
v Massachusetts, 582 US 286, 298 (2017). “After all, the right to a n
open courtroom protects the rights of the public at large, and the
press, as well as the rights of the accused.” Id. at 298-299.
“The parties may not, by their mere agreement, empower a judge t o
exclude the public and press.” Detroit Free Press v Macomb Circuit
Judge, 405 Mich 544, 549 (1979). “When a motion for closure is made,
the judge should, at a minimum, take testimony at a hearing open t o
all interested parties, explore the constitutional and statutory
validity of any proffered justifications for excluding the public and
press from any portion of the trial, and determine whether any
alternative and less restrictive mechanisms exist.” Id.
“The party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding
interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be n o
broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court mus t
consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and i t
must make findings adequate to support the closure.” People v
Sherrill, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up) (observing tha t
MCR 8.116(D) “prescrib[es] procedures for courts to follow whe n
limiting access to court proceedings”). See also Waller, 467 US at 48,
and People v Kline, 197 Mich App 165, 169 (1992).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.1
Partial closure. “A partial closure occurs where the public is only
partially excluded, such as when family members or the press are
allowed to remain, or when the closure order is narrowly tailored t o
specific needs.” Kline, 197 Mich App at 170 n 2 (internal citatio n
omitted). Notably, “the effect of a partial closure of trial does no t
reach the level of a total closure and only a substantial, rather than a
compelling reason for the closure is required.” People v Russell, 29 7
Mich App 707, 720 (2012) (holding that limited courtroom capacity
constituted a substantial reason for the partial closure of voir dire
proceedings and did not deny the defendant his right to a publi c
trial). See also People v Gibbs, 299 Mich App 473, 481-482 (2013) (n o
error occurred where, before jury selection began, the trial cour t
stated that spectators were welcome to enter, “but [the courtroo m
was] then closed once jury selection began” because the trial cour t
found it “‘too confusing’ to allow individuals to come and g o
during jury selection”; furthermore, even if error occurred, the
defendant was “not entitled to a new trial or evidentiary hearing
. . . [where] both parties engaged in vigorous voir dire, there wer e
no objections to either party’s peremptory challenges, . . . each sid e
expressed satisfaction with the jury[, and] . . . the venire itself wa s
present”); Kline, 197 Mich App at 170, 172-173 (remanding for th e
trial court to articulate its reasons for partially closing the courtroo m
and retaining jurisdiction to evaluate whether the interests asserted
to justify the partial closure were sufficient to outweigh the
defendant’s right to a public trial).
Total Closure. “A total closure involves excluding all persons from
the courtroom for some period while a partial closure involve s
excluding one or more individuals, but not all, from the
courtroom.” Sherrill, ___ Mich App at ___ (holding that closure o f
the courtroom due to COVID-19 restrictions qualified as fully closed
“because all members of the public were prevented from attending
[the] trial in person”). In Sherrill, “[t]he local court order closing the
courthouse to spectators addressed an overriding interest that wa s
likely to be prejudiced if the courtroom was open to the public.” Id.
at ___. “On the facts, the closure of the courtroom was also n o
broader than necessary.” Id. at ___ (“The decision to limit spectator s
from attending the trial in person was intended to make the
courtroom a safer environment for the jury and others who were
required to participate in the trial.”). Although “[t]he trial court did
not consider reasonable alternatives because there was no objectio n
to the closure of the courtroom,” the local court order “anticipated a
reasonable alternative to viewing the trial in person because the trial
was streamed over YouTube.” Id. at ___. “This option allowed the
public to view the trial while keeping those participating in the trial
safe.” Id. at ___ (rejecting argument “that this alternative was no t
available to certain communities because of limited access t o
internet service” citing “the widespread availability of cellular
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-3

Section 1.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
service and smartphones, as well as the availability of interne t
services at public libraries”).
While “the trial court did not explicitly make findings on the record
to support the closure,” the local court order addressed “the factor s
that caused the chief judge to begin implementing the limited pla n
to reopen the courtrooms to hold trials and conduct other business”
and “adopt[ed] multiple procedures and rules to limit the spread of
the virus,” including that “proceedings were to be conducted
virtually to the maximum extent possible.” Id. at ___ (concluding
the local court order “adequately represented the underlying
findings for limiting public access to the courtroom on a temporary
basis”). “Thus, although the court did not make explicit findings,
given the record, . . . the reasons why the court closed the courtroo m
to the in-person spectators [were] apparent.” Id. at ___. “In light o f
the carefully implemented procedures adopted to gradually reope n
the courthouse to full capacity,” the defendant failed to show “tha t
the temporary limit on in-person spectators amounted to plain error
affecting his substantial rights.” Id. at ___.
B. Limitations on Access to Court Proceedings
“Except as otherwise provided by statute or court rule, a court may
not limit access by the public to a court proceeding unless
(a) a party has filed a written motion that identifies th e
specific interest to be protected, or the court sua sponte
has identified a specific interest to be protected, and th e
court determines that the interest outweighs the right o f
access;
(b) the denial of access is narrowly tailored t o
accommodate the interest to be protected, and there i s
no less restrictive means to adequately and effectivel y
protect the interest; and
(c) the court states on the record the specific reasons fo r
the decision to limit access to the proceeding.” MCR
8.116(D)(1).
Any person may file a motion to set aside an order entered under
1
MCR 8.116(D)(1) or object to its entry. MCR 2.119 governs the
proceedings for motions or objections under MCR 8.116(D)(1). MCR
8.116(D)(2).

C. Film or Electronic Media Coverage of Court Proceedings
See Administrative Order No. 1989-1, 432 Mich cxii (1989), for th e
guidelines applicable to film or electronic media coverage of cour t
proceedings.
D. “Gag Orders”
The term gag order refers to a court order prohibiting attorneys,
witnesses, and parties from discussing a case with reporters, or to a
court order prohibiting reporters from publishing informatio n
related to a case. Black’s Law Dictionary (5th pocket ed). A cour t
order prohibiting publication of information related to a case i s
unconstitutional if it imposes a prior restraint on speech. Nebrask a
Press Ass’n v Stuart, 427 US 539, 556 (1976) (“The [United State s
Supreme] Court has interpreted [First Amendment] guarantees t o
afford special protection against orders that [impose a prior
restraint on speech by] prohibit[ing] the publication or broadcast of
particular information or commentary”). See also People v Sledge, 312
Mich App 516, 537 (2015), in which “[t]he trial court issued a gag
order precluding all potential trial participants from making any
extrajudicial statement regarding the case to the media or to any
person for the purpose of dissemination to the public.” The Court of
Appeals vacated the gag order, holding that “[t]he overbroad and
vague gag order constituted a prior restraint on freedom of speech,
freedom of expression, and freedom of the press, and the trial cour t
failed to justify the gag order.” Id.
MCR 8.116(D)(1) should be followed in assessing whether to issue a
gag order prohibiting discussion of the case with reporters. See
Section (B).
Standing to Challenge a Gag Order. “[A] newspaper interested i n
publishing articles regarding . . . criminal charges stemming fro m
[a] failed” county construction project “had standing . . . [both] as a
recipient of speech and as a news gatherer” to challenge the trial
court’s “gag order precluding all potential trial participants [in the
cases pending against the defendants] from making any
extrajudicial statement regarding the case to the media or to any
person for the purpose of dissemination to the public.” Sledge, 31 2
Mich App at 519, 526, 537 (citations omitted). The newspaper
“identified at least one willing speaker who felt restrained because
of the gag order,” and “the gag order cut the [newspaper] off fro m
access to important sources of information because it prohibited any

Section 1.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
potential trial participant from speaking with the news media
regarding the case.” Id. at 526, 528 (citations omitted).
E. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision whether to permit public access to cour t
proceedings is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, in light of the
facts and circumstances of the particular case. Int’l Union, Unite d
Auto, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America v
Dorsey, 268 Mich App 313, 329 (2005), rev’d in part on other ground s
474 Mich 1097 (2006), citing Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc, 435
2
US 589, 599 (1978).
1.2 Access to Court Files and Records
A. Personal Identifying Information (PII)
“[P]ersonal identifying information is protected and shall not be
included in any public document or attachment filed with the cour t
on or after April 1, 2022,” unless otherwise provided by the
Michigan Court Rules. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(a).
1. Protected PII Defined
An individual’s protected PII includes the following:
• date of birth,
• Social Security number or national identificatio n
number,
• driver’s license number or number of state-issued
personal identification card,
• passport number, and
• financial account numbers. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(a)(i)-(v).
2. Filing and Accessing Protected PII
a. Filing a Document Containing Protected PII
When law or court rule requires protected PII, as it i s
defined in MCR 1.109(D)(9)(a), to be filed with the court,
2For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.

=== Page 29 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.2
or when the court finds the information necessary t o
identify a specific individual in a case, the PII must be
provided using the form and manner required by th e
3
State Court Administrative Office (SCAO). MCR
1.109(D)(9)(b)(i).
Protected PII provided to the court in compliance wit h
the requirements of MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b) must be entered
into the case management system according to standard s
established by the SCAO. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(e). “Th e
information shall be maintained for the purposes for
which it was collected and for which its use is authorized
by federal or state law or court rule; however, it shall no t
be included or displayed as case history under MCR
8.119(D)(1).
Except as otherwise provided in the court rules, when a
party is required to provide protected PII in a publi c
document to be filed with the court, the party must redact
the protected PII from the document and file the PII for m
4
approved by SCAO. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(iii). Unredacted
protected PII may be included on Uniform Law Citation s
involving civil infractions filed with the court and o n
proposed orders submitted to the court. Id. If a part y
submits a proposed order to the court that is required t o
contain unredacted protected PII once issued by the
court, the party must not attach the proposed order t o
another document. Id.
The SCAO form must contain the information redacted
from the document and must assign an appropriate
reference to the information contained in the SCAO for m
that uniquely associates each item redacted from the
document with the corresponding personal identifying
5
information provided on the SCAO form. MCR
3SCAO Form MC 97, Protected Personal Identifying Information (for an individual who is a defendant,
respondent, or decedent), and SCAO Form MC 97a, Addendum to Protected Personal Identifyin g
Information (for an individual who is a plaintiff, petitioner, or other individual).
4SCAO Form MC 97, Protected Personal Identifying Information (for an individual who is a defendant,
respondent, or decedent), and SCAO Form MC 97a, Addendum to Protected Personal Identifyin g
Information (for an individual who is a plaintiff, petitioner, or other individual).
5A specific form for protecting personal identifying information must be filed when a petition is filed i n
child protective proceedings. See SCAO Form MC 97b, Protected Personal Identifying Information. SCA O
Form MC 97b is the form listing the birthdates, which are protected PII under MCR 1.109(D)(9)(a), of the
children and other parties named on a petition to initiate child protective proceedings. Birthdates appea r
on SCAO Form MC 97b in fields designated by number and letter. Those number and letter combination s
are noted on SCAO Form JC 04b so that actual birthdates do not appear on the petition; instead, the
petition contains only the letter and number designation that corresponds to a party’s particular birthdat e
as it is listed on SCAO Form 97b.

1.109(D)(9)(b)(iii). When a reference is made in a case t o
the identifier representing the personal identifying
information on the SCAO form, the reference to the
identifier is understood to refer to the complete
information related to the identifier appearing on the
form. Id. The SCAO form may include fields for the PII ,
and the information inserted into the fields will be
6
protected. Id.
Providing a Social Security number. When a Social
Security number is required to be filed with the court, the
number must be limited to the last four digits, excep t
when the documents being filed are required by the
Friend of the Court and will not be placed in the court’ s
7
legal file under MCR 8.119(D). MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(ii).
b. Amending Protected PII
An individual may amend as of right the protected PII
provided in the SCAO form. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(iii).
c. Access to a Document Containing Protected PII
Limited access to protected PII. Protected PII under MCR
1.109(D) is nonpublic. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(iv). Protecte d
PII is available for purposes of case activity or a s
otherwise required by law or court rule. Id. The protected
PII provided is available only to the parties in a case, t o
interested persons described in the court rules, and t o
other persons, entities, or agencies authorized by law or
court rules to access nonpublic records that have bee n
filed with the court. Id.
3. Consenting to the Access of Protected PII
A party may stipulate in writing to permit any person, entity,
or agency to access to his or her protected PII. MCR
1.109(D)(9)(b)(v)(A). Any person, entity, or agency attempting
to access the protected PII must provide the court with th e
stipulation permitting access. Id.
6Local court forms are prohibited from containing fields in which protected PII may be entered. MCR
1.109(D)(9)(c). A court must not reject a document to be filed, dismiss a case, or otherwise take negative
action against a party if the party has failed to provide protected PII on a local court form. Id.
7See also MCR 1.109(D)(10)(b), which provides that a court’s dissemination of social security numbers i s
limited to the purposes permitted under federal or state law. If a request is filed on or after March 1, 2006,
for a copy of a public document, “the court must review the document and redact all social security
numbers on the copy.” Id. “This requirement does not apply to certified copies or true copies when the y
are required by law, or copies made for those uses for which the social security number was provided.” Id.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.2
a. Access to a Party’s Date of Birth
Obtaining authority to access a party’s date of birth. For
the purpose of confirming a particular person’s identity
and with the person’s consent, an individual may be
authorized to access a party’s date of birth without having
to present a stipulation as is required under MCR
1.109(D)(9)(b)(v)(A) in order to access protected PII. MCR
1.109(D)(9)(b)(v)(B)(1).
Possession of the party’s consent. The individual
authorized to access a birthdate must retain possession of
the consent, or the consent must be retained by the entity
for which the individual works, or the person or
organization (or someone acting on their behalf) seeking
a party’s date of birth. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(v)(B)(1).
b. List of Individuals Authorized to Access a Party’s
Date of Birth
SCAO list of authorized individuals. The SCAO wil l
maintain a list of the individuals having the authority t o
access a party’s date of birth. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(v)(B)(1).
To appear on the SCAO list, an individual must provide
in writing the name of the entity for which the individual
works and an assurance that on each occasion the
individual seeks to confirm a party’s birthdate, it will be
in the course of the individual’s work and with the
consent of the person whose date of birth is sought. Id.
The assurance must be updated within every six month s
from the date of the original submission. Id.
Additional information required for placement on the
SCAO list. In addition, an individual attempting to be
placed on the SCAO list of individuals authorized t o
access birthdates must provide proof of his or her
employer’s or hiring entity’s professional liability
insurance in effect during the time the individual i s
seeking the person’s date of birth. MCR
1.109(D)(9)(b)(v)(B)(2). The proof of insurance i s
nonpublic and must be updated upon the expiration or
termination of the insurance policy. Id.
Court’s duty to verify identity. A court must verify the
identity of an individual claiming to be authorized t o
obtain a person’s birthdate by matching the name
appearing on the individual’s state-issued identificatio n
card with the individual’s name on the SCAO list. MCR
1.109(D)(9)(b)(v)(B)(3). Courts and SCOA may creat e

Section 1.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
secure, individualized accounts that allow authorized
individuals to access a party’s date of birth electronically.
Id. After confirming the identity of the individual seekin g
information about a person’s birthdate, a court must
supply the authorized individual with a public register of
actions or other public document that includes th e
person’s date of birth. Id.
4. No Exemptions for Service of Protected PII
Except by a court order issued under MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(vii)
making the PII confidential, there is no exemption from the
requirement that a court or a party serve a nonpublic
document that was filed with the court and includes th e
protected PII that must be provided to the court as stated i n
MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(i). MCR 1.109(D)(9)(b)(vi).
5. Protected PII May Be Made Confidential
For just cause found, a court may, on its own motion or b y
motion of a party, order that PII be made confidential. MCR
1.109(D)(9)(b)(vii). The order must identify the person, party,
or entity whose access to the PII is restricted. Id. When a party’s
home address or telephone number is made confidential, th e
court order must provide an alternative address for service o n
the party or an alternative phone number by which the part y
may be contacted about case activity. Id.
6. Failing to Comply With Requirements to Protect PII
If a party files his or her protected PII in a public documen t
and does not provide the information in the form and manne r
established by the SCAO under MCR 1.109(D)(9), the party
waives the protection available for his or her PII. MCR
1.109(D)(9)(d)(i). When a party fails to comply with th e
requirements of MCR 1.109(D) the court, on its own initiative
or by a party’s motion, may have the improperly file d
documents sealed and order that new documents wit h
redactions be prepared and filed. MCR 1.109(D)(9)(d)(ii).
7. Redacting Protected and Unprotected PII
a. Protected PII in Documents Filed With a Court
A person whose protected PII appears in a documen t
filed with the court may request in writing that the
8
protected PII be redacted; if a person makes such a
request, the clerk of the court must promptly process the
Page 1-10 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 33 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.2
request. MCR 1.109(D)(10)(c)(i). No motion fee is require d
for the request, the request must specify the protected PII
to be redacted, and the document must be maintained a s
a nonpublic document in the case file. Id.
b. Unprotected PII in Public Documents Filed With
a Court
PII not protected under MCR 1.109 may be redacted or
made confidential or nonpublic. MCR 1.109(D)(10)(c)(ii).
A party or a person having unprotected PII in a publi c
document filed with the court may, in an ex parte motio n
9
using the appropriate SCAO-approved form, reques t
that the court direct the court clerk to redact the
information specified by the party or person or to make
the information confidential or nonpublic. Id. The cour t
has discretion to hold a hearing on the motion. Id. Th e
court must enter an order to redact the information or t o
make the information confidential or nonpublic “if the
party or person’s privacy interest outweighs the public’ s
10
interest in the information.” Id.
c. Protected PII in an Exhibit Offered for Hearing
or Trial
Protected PII may be redacted from an exhibit offered at a
hearing or a trial when a person or party having protected
PII in the exhibit requests in writing to have the PII
redacted. MCR 1.109(D)(10)(c)(iii). No motion fee is
required. Id. The person or party seeking redaction must
identify in the request the specific protected PII to be
redacted, and the request must be maintained as a
nonpublic document in the case file. Id. The court mus t
order the information redacted “if the party or person’ s
privacy interest outweighs the public’s interest in the
information.” Id.
d. Unredacted Protected PII in Transcripts Filed
With a Court
Unredacted protected PII may be included on transcript s
filed with the court; however, the clerk of the court mus t
redact protected PII if a person submits a written reques t

identifying the page and line number for each place in the
transcript where the PII is located. MCR
1.109(D)(10)(c)(iv).
8. Responsibility for Redaction
The parties and their attorneys are solely responsible fo r
excluding or redacting the PII listed in MCR 1.109(D)(9) from
all documents filed with or offered to the court. MCR
1.109(D)(10)(a). There is no requirement that at the time o f
filing, a court clerk review, redact, or screen documents for PII,
whether protected or unprotected, without regard to whethe r
the documents are filed electronically or on paper. Id.
Except as otherwise provided in the court rules, a court clerk i s
not required to redact protected PII from documents filed wit h
11
or offered to the court before providing a copy of th e
document requested, whether in-person or via the internet, o r
before making available at the courthouse via a publicl y
accessible computer that gives a person direct access to th e
document. MCR 1.109(D)(10)(a).
9. Certifying a Record
“The clerk of the court may certify a redacted record as a tru e
copy of an original record on file with the court by stating tha t
information has been redacted in accordance with law or cour t
rule, or sealed as ordered by the court.” MCR 1.109(D)(10)(d).
10. Maintaining a Document After Redacting PII
Documents from which PII has been redacted, or to whic h
access has been restricted, must be maintained according to th e
standards established by the SCAO. MCR 1.109(D)(10)(e).
B. Record of Proceedings Required
MCR 8.108(B)(1) states that a “court reporter or recorder shall attend
the court sessions under the direction of the court and take a
verbatim record of the following:
(a) the voir dire of prospective jurors;
(b) the testimony;
11This provision applies equally to documents filed with or offered to the court before or after April 1,
2022. MCR 1.109(D)(10)(a).
Page 1-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 35 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.2
(c) the charge to the jury;
(d) in a jury trial, the opening statements and fina l
arguments;
(e) the reasons given by the court for granting o r
refusing any motion made by a party during the cours e
of a trial; and
(f) opinions and orders dictated by the court and othe r
matters as may be prescribed by the court.”
MCR 8.108(E) states in part that “[t]he court reporter or recorder
shall prepare without delay, in legible English, a transcript of the
records taken by him or her (or any part thereof): (1) to any party o n
request, [or] . . . (2) on order of the trial court.” Id. If the transcript i s
prepared in response to a party’s request, “[t]he reporter or recorder
is entitled to receive the compensation prescribed in the statute o n
fees from the person who makes the request.” MCR 8.108(E)(1). If
the transcript is prepared on order of the court, “[t]he court may
order the transcript prepared without expense to either party.” MCR
8.108(E)(2).
MCR 8.109(A) indicates that a trial court is “authorized to use audi o
and video recording equipment for making a record of cour t
proceedings” if the equipment meets the standards published by
12
the State Court Administrative Office (SCAO) or is analo g
equipment that SCAO has approved for use. In addition, trial court s
that use audio or video recording equipment “must adhere to the
audio and video recording operating standards published by
[SCAO].” MCR 8.109(B).
Occasionally, proceedings occur without a court reporter present, or
with a recording system that was not turned on or did not functio n
correctly. MCR 7.210(B)(2) requires specific steps that an appellan t
must follow “[w]hen a transcript of the proceedings in the trial
court or tribunal cannot be obtained from the court reporter or
recorder . . . to settle the record and to cause the filing of a certifie d
settled statement of facts to serve as a substitute for the transcript.”
If a settled statement of facts is made and certified as prescribed by
MCR 7.210(B)(2), it controls the timing of the appellant’s brief in th e
same manner as would a transcript. MCR 7.212(A)(1)(a)(iii). “When,
after remand, it is clear that no settlement of the facts is possible,
then the grant of a new trial is permissible to preserve a defendant’ s
right to appeal.” Elazier v Detroit Non-Profit Housing Corp, 158 Mic h
App 247, 250 (1987).

Section 1.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
C. Access to Court Records
MCR 1.109(F) provides that “[r]equests for access to public cour t
records shall be granted in accordance with MCR 8.119(H).” MCR
8.119(H) provides, in part:
[13]
“Except as otherwise provided in [MCR 8.119](F),
only case records as defined in [MCR 8.119](D) are
public records, subject to access in accordance wit h
14
these rules.”
Additionally, MCR 8.119(H)(7) provides that “[u]nless access to a
case record or information contained in a record as defined in [MCR
8.119](D) is restricted by statute, court rule, or an order [sealing a
[15]
record] pursuant to [MCR 8.119](I), any person may inspect tha t
16
record and may obtain copies as provided in [MCR 8.119](J).” For
instance, MCL 552.6a(1) restricts public access to “a complaint for
divorce filed with the court . . . until the proof of service has bee n
17
filed with the court.”
“Access to information on set aside convictions is limited to a cour t
of competent jurisdiction, an agency of the judicial branch of state
government, the department of corrections, a law enforcemen t
agency, a prosecuting attorney, the attorney general, and the
governor upon request and only for the purposes identified in MCL
780.623. Access may also be provided to the individual whos e
conviction was set aside, that individual’s attorney, and the victim(s)
as defined in MCL 780.623. The court must redact all informatio n
related to the set aside conviction or convictions before making the
case record or a court record available to the public in any format. ”
MCR 8.119(H)(9).
13 MCR 8.119(F) provides that “[c]ourt recordings, log notes, jury seating charts, and all other records such
as tapes, backup tapes, discs, and any other medium used or created in the making of a record of
proceedings and kept pursuant to MCR 8.108 are court records and are subject to access in accordance
with [MCR 8.119(H)(8)(b)].” MCR 8.119(H)(8)(b), in turn, requires every court, by administrative order, to
“establish a policy for whether to provide access for records defined in [MCR 8.119](F) and if access is to be
provided, outline the procedure for accessing those records[.]”
14 MCR 8.119(H)(4) provides that “[i]f a request is made for a public record that is maintained
electronically, the court is required to provide a means for access to that record”; “[h]owever, the records
cannot be provided through a publicly accessible website if protected personal identifying information ha s
not been redacted from those records.” “If a public document prepared or issued by the court on or afte r
April 1, 2022, or a Uniform Law Citation filed with the court on or after April 1, 2022, contains protected
personal identifying information, the information must be redacted before it can be provided to the public,
whether the document is provided upon request via a paper or electronic copy, or direct access via a
publicly accessible computer at the courthouse. Upon receipt by the court on or after April 1, 2022,
protected personal identifying information included in a proposed order shall be protected by the court a s
required under MCR 8.119(H) as if the document was prepared or issued by the court.” MCR 8.119(H)(5).
See Section 1.2(A) for discussion of protected personal identifying information.
15 See Section 1.2(D) for discussion of sealing records under MCR 8.119(I).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.2
MCR 8.119(G) provides, in part, that “[a]ll court records no t
included in [MCR 8.119(D)-(F)] are considered administrative and
fiscal records or nonrecord materials and are not subject to publi c
access under [MCR 8.119](H).”
Administrative Order No. 2006-2, 474 Mich cliv (2006) addresses th e
confidentiality of social security numbers and management of non-
public information contained within public documents.
“[A] court is prohibited from sealing court orders and cour t
18
opinions under [the plain language of MCR 8.119(I)(6) .]” Jenson v
Puste, 290 Mich App 338, 347 (2010). “Significantly, [MCR
8.119(I)(6)] does not allow a court the authority to exercise
discretion in deciding whether to seal [a court order or opinion],
unlike the limited discretion that [MCR 8.119(I)(1)] allows when a
motion involves other court records.” Jenson, 290 Mich App at 342-
347 (trial court properly held that it did not have the authority t o
seal a personal protection order pursuant to MCR 8.119(I)(6)).
Access to court records can be restricted by the Legislature. In re
Midland Publishing Co, Inc, 420 Mich 148, 159 (1984). For example ,
MCL 750.520k allows a court, in a criminal sexual conduct case, t o
order the suppression of the victim’s and actor’s names and detail s
of the alleged offense until after the preliminary examination. For a
partial listing of statutes, court rules, and cases that restrict publi c
access to court records, see the State Court Administrative Office’s
Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards.
To determine whether a right of access exists regarding a document,
a court should ask whether the document has historically been ope n
to the public and press, and whether access “‘plays a significan t
positive role in the function of the particular process in question.’”
In re People v Atkins, 444 Mich 737, 740 (1994), quoting Press-
Enterprise Co v Superior Ct of California, 478 US 1, 8 (1986) (after th e
defendant was found competent to stand trial, the court provided
newspapers with an edited (as opposed to full text) version of the
psychiatrist’s written report; because competency reports that have
not been admitted into evidence have traditionally been viewed a s
confidential, and public access would not play a significant positive
role in the functioning of the particular process in question, the
court’s denial of full access to the report was affirmed).
17“An entity administering or providing services under . . . 42 USC 651 to [42 USC 669b] may access a
complaint for divorce made nonpublic under [MCL 552.6a].” MCL 552.6a(2). Although 2022 PA 175 became
effective July 21, 2022, MCL 552.6a is not applicable until October 1, 2022.
18 Formerly MCR 8.119(F)(5); MCR 8.119(I)(6) provides that “[a] court may not seal a court order o r

“[T]he press has a qualified right of postverdict access to jurors’
names and addresses, subject to the trial court’s discretion to fashio n
an order that takes into account the competing interest of juror
safety and any other interests that may be implicated by the court’ s
order.” In re Disclosure of Juror Names & Addresses, 233 Mich App 604,
630-631 (1999). If a court determines that jurors’ safety concerns are
“legitimate and reasonable,” the court may deny media access t o
jurors’ names and addresses. Id. at 630. Jurors’ privacy concern s
alone are insufficient to deny access to jurors’ names. Id.
Committee Tips:
Reports and records may be privileged or
confidential and their treatment should be
scrutinized in each case. Examples are substance
abuse evaluations and treatment records,
medical records and reports, and psychological/
psychiatric records and reports.
Consider whether access to the record is limited
by statute, court order, or court rule. See the
Nonpublic and Limited-Access Court Records
chart.
Consider whether a filed document can be
removed from the file by court order. See MCR
8.119(H).
For other information parties wish to keep
confidential, consider having the document
marked as an exhibit, reviewed by the court on
the record, and then returned to the parties at
the conclusion of the proceeding. See MCR
1.109(A)(2); MCR 2.518(A) (exhibits received an d
accepted into evidence under MCR 2.518 are not
court records).
D. Sealing Court Records
MCR 8.119(I)(1)-(3) provide information on sealing court records, a s
follows:
“(1) Except as otherwise provided by statute or cour t
rule, a court may not enter an order that seals court s
[sic] records, in whole or in part, in any action o r
proceeding, unless
Page 1-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 39 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.2
(a) a party has filed a written motion that identifie s
the specific interest to be protected,
(b) the court has made a finding of good cause, i n
writing or on the record, which specifies the
grounds for the order, and
(c) there is no less restrictive means to adequately
and effectively protect the specific interes t
asserted.
(2) In determining whether good cause has been shown,
the court must consider,
(a) the interests of the parties, including, where
there is an allegation of domestic violence, the
safety of the alleged or potential victim of the
domestic violence, and
(b) the interest of the public.
(3) The court must provide any interested person th e
opportunity to be heard concerning the sealing of th e
records.”
Committee Tip:
MCR 8.119(I) grants the court limited discretion
to seal records. Courts should be cautious of
sealing records unless the limiting factors set
forth in MCR 8.119(I) have been satisfied.
MCR 8.119(I) is not intended to limit a court’s authority to issu e
protective orders under MCR 2.302(C) for trade secrets, etc, or
require that a protective order issued under MCR 2.302(C) be filed
with the Clerk of the Supreme Court and the State Court
Administrative Office (SCAO). MCR 8.119(I)(8). “A protective orde r
issued under MCR 2.302(C) may authorize parties to file materials
under seal in accordance with the provisions of the protective order
without the necessity of filing a motion to seal under this rule.”
MCR 8.119(I)(8).
“[A] court is prohibited from sealing court orders and cour t
19
opinions under [the plain language of MCR 8.119(I)(6) .]” Jenson v
19Formerly MCR 8.119(F)(5); MCR 8.119(I)(6) provides that “[a] court may not seal a court order o r
opinion, including an order or opinion that disposes of a motion to seal the record.”
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-17
=== Page 40 ===
Section 1.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Puste, 290 Mich App 338, 347 (2010). “Significantly, [MCR
8.119(I)(6)] does not give a court the authority to exercise discretion
in deciding whether to seal [a court order or opinion], unlike the
20
limited discretion that [MCR 8.119(I)(1) ] allows when a motio n
involves other court records.” Jenson, 290 Mich App at 342-347 (trial
court properly held that it did not have the authority to seal a
personal protection order (PPO) pursuant to MCR 8.119(I)(6)).
“Any person may file a motion to set aside an order that disposes of
a motion to seal the record, to unseal a document filed under seal
pursuant to MCR 2.302(C), or an objection to entry of a proposed
[21]
order. MCR 2.119 governs the proceedings on such a motion or
objection.” MCR 8.119(I)(9).
If a court grants a motion to seal a court record, the court must send
a copy of the order to the Clerk of the Michigan Supreme Court and
to SCAO. MCR 8.119(I)(7).
When a party files an appeal in a case where the trial court sealed
the file, the file remains sealed while in the possession of the Cour t
of Appeals. MCR 7.211(C)(9)(a). Any requests to view the sealed fil e
will be referred to the trial court. Id. MCR 8.119(I) also governs th e
procedure for sealing a Court of Appeals file. MCR 7.211(C)(9)(c).
“Materials that are subject to a motion to seal a Court of Appeals file
in whole or in part must be held under seal pending the court’ s
disposition of the motion.”Id.
MCR 8.119(D) sets out procedures to protect the confidentiality of a
sealed record:
“Documents and other materials made nonpublic o r
confidential by court rule, statute, or order of the cour t
[sealing a record] pursuant to [MCR 8.119](I) must be
designated accordingly and maintained to allow onl y
authorized access. In the event of transfer or appeal of a
case, every rule, statute, or order of the court unde r
[MCR 8.119](I) that makes a document or other
materials in that case nonpublic or confidential applie s
uniformly to every court in Michigan, irrespective of th e
court in which the document or other materials wer e
originally filed.”
See also MCR 2.518(C), which provides:

“Confidentiality. If the court retains discover y
materials filed pursuant to MCR 1.109(D) or an exhibit
submitted pursuant to [MCR 2.518] after a hearing or
trial and the material is confidential as provided by law,
court rule, or court order pursuant to MCR 8.119(I), th e
court must continue to maintain the material in a
confidential manner.”
E. Record Retention
“The State Court Administrative Office [(SCAO)] shall establish and
maintain records management policies and procedures for the
courts, including a records retention and disposal schedule, i n
accordance with [S]upreme [C]ourt rules.” MCL 600.1428(1). “Th e
record retention and disposal schedule shall be developed and
maintained as prescribed in . . . MCL 399.5.” MCL 600.1428(1).
“Subject to the records reproduction act, . . . MCL 24.401 to [MCL]
24.406, a court may dispose of any record as prescribed in [MCL
600.1428(1)].” MCL 600.1428(2).
“A record, regardless of its medium, shall not be disposed of until
the record has been in the custody of the court for the retentio n
period established under [MCL 600.1428(1)].” MCL 600.1428(3).
MCR 8.119(K) provides:
“Retention Periods and Disposal of Court Records. For
purposes of retention, the records of the trial court s
include: (1) administrative and fiscal records, (2) cas e
file and other case records, (3) court recordings, lo g
notes, jury seating charts, and recording media, and (4 )
nonrecord material. The records of the trial courts shall
be retained in the medium prescribed by MCR 1.109.
The records of a trial court may not be disposed o f
except as authorized by the records retention an d
disposal schedule and upon order by the chief judge o f
that court. Before disposing of records subject to th e
order, the court shall first transfer to the Archives o f
Michigan any records specified as such in the Michiga n
trial courts approved records retention and disposa l
schedule. An order disposing of court records shall
comply with the retention periods established by th e
[SCAO] and approved by the state court administrator ,
Attorney General, State Administrative Board, Archive s
of Michigan, and Records Management Services of th e
Department of Management and Budget, in accordanc e
with MCL 399.811.”

F. Access and Reproduction Fees
1. Documents
“A court may not charge a fee to access public case histor y
information or to retrieve or inspect a case documen t
irrespective of the medium in which the record is retained, th e
manner in which access to the case record is provided
(including whether a record is retained onsite or offsite), and
the technology used to create, store, retrieve, reproduce, and
maintain the case record.” MCR 8.119(J)(1). “A court may
charge a reproduction fee for a document pursuant to MCL
600.1988, except when required by law or court rule to provide
a copy without charge to a person or other entity.” MCR
8.119(J)(2). “The court may provide access to its public cas e
records in any medium authorized by the record s
reproduction act, 1992 PA 116; MCL 24.401 to [MCL] 24.403. ”
MCR 8.119(J)(3).
“Reproduction of a case document means the act of producin g
a copy of that document through any medium authorized b y
the records reproduction act, 1992 PA 116; MCL 24.401 t o
[MCL] 24.403.
(a) A court may charge only for the actual cost of
labor and supplies and the actual use of the
system, including printing from a public terminal,
to reproduce a case document and not the cos t
associated with the purchase and maintenance of
any system or technology used to store, retrieve,
and reproduce the document.
(b) If a person wishes to obtain copies of
documents in a file, the clerk shall provide copie s
upon receipt of the actual cost of reproduction.
(c) Except as otherwise directed by statute or cour t
rule, a standard fee may be established, pursuan t
to [MCR 8.119(H)(8)], for providing copies of
documents on file.” MCR 8.119(J)(4).
22 See SCAO’s Memorandum regarding Court Rule Amendments Pertaining to Court Records, December 6,
2012, for highlights of the comprehensive set of court rule revisions designed to update and clarify variou s
rules pertaining to court records.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.3
2. Court Recordings
“Every court, shall adopt an administrative order pursuant t o
MCR 8.112(B) to establish a policy for whether to provid e
access for records defined in [MCR 8.119(F), which includ e
court recordings, log notes, jury searing charts, and media] and
if access is to be provided, outline the procedure for accessin g
those records[.]” MCR 8.119(H)(8)(b). The administrative orde r
must also set forth the reasonable cost of reproduction and
specify the process for determining costs under [MCR
23
8.119(J)].” MCR 8.119(H)(8)(c)-(d).
Committee Tip:
If the court decides to provide access to court
recordings in its administrative order, the court
should consider whether an audio copy of th e
court proceeding may be provided upon request,
or if access to the recording will be limited to a
certified transcript.
G. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision to permit public access to court documents i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion, in light of the facts and
circumstances of the particular case. Int’l Union, United Auto,
Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America v Dorsey, 26 8
Mich App 313, 329 (2005), rev’d in part on other grounds 474 Mic h

1.3 Access to Judge
A. Ex Parte Communications
“A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte
communications, or consider other communications made to the
judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending or
impending proceeding, except” in the limited circumstances set ou t
in MCJC 3(A)(5). The exceptions include communications for
scheduling, administrative matters, consulting with cour t
23See Section 1.2(A) for additional information on proceedings that are required to be recorded.

Section 1.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
personnel, and, with the consent of the parties, conferring
separately with the parties and their attorneys in an effort to reac h
resolution. See MCJC 3(A)(5)(a)-(e).
Committee Tips:
The prohibition on ex parte communications
•
precludes a judge from obtaining or seeking
substantive information without both parties
having the opportunity to participate. It is
recommended that court staff be carefully
trained to intercept prohibited ex parte
communications.
It is further recommended that court staff
•
return an ex parte communication to the sender
(if a return address is provided) advising that the
court is precluded from considering the
information without both parties having the
opportunity to review and respond to the
communication pursuant to the MCJC 3(A)(5). I f
court staff is unable to return the
communication, it is suggested that the
communication be sealed in an envelope clearly
marked “ex parte communication” so it is not
inadvertently reviewed by the court.
Ex parte communications can include effort s
•
by the parties or other persons interested in the
case to contact the judge, contacts with or fro m
police or other agencies, and communications
with jurors. The judge also should not view the
scene without notifying the parties, who should
have the opportunity to be present.
B. Judge’s Appearance by Video Communication
24
Equipment
“The State Court Administrative Office is authorized . . . to approv e
the use of two-way interactive video technology in the trial courts t o
allow judicial officers to preside remotely in any proceeding tha t
may be conducted by two-way interactive technology or
communication equipment without the consent of the parties under

1.4 Form of Address
Parties and attorneys may include a preferred form of address —Ms. ,
Mr., or Mx. — in the name section of a document’s caption. MCR
1.109(D)(1)(b). Parties and attorneys may also include one of the
following personal pronouns: he/him/his, she/her/hers, or they/them/
theirs. Id. When addressing, referring to, or identifying a party o r
attorney, either orally or in writing, courts must use the individual’ s
name, designated salutation or personal pronouns, or other respectful
means consistent with the individual’s designated salutation or personal
pronouns. Id.

1.6 Attorney Conduct
“A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and
a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice. ”

Section 1.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Preamble to the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct. “Many of a
lawyer’s professional responsibilities are prescribed in the Rules o f
Professional Conduct, as well as substantive and procedural law.
However, a lawyer is also guided by personal conscience and the
approbation of professional peers. A lawyer should strive to attain th e
highest level of skill, to improve the law and the legal profession and t o
exemplify the legal profession’s ideals of public service.” Id. “Every
lawyer is responsible for observance of the Rules of Professional
Conduct[, and a] lawyer should also aid in securing their observance by
other lawyers.” Id. “Neglect of these responsibilities compromises th e
independence of the profession and public interest in which it serves. Id.
A. Disciplinary Proceedings
“The license to practice law in Michigan is, among other things, a
continuing proclamation by the Supreme Court that the holder is fi t
to be entrusted with professional and judicial matters and to aid i n
the administration of justice as an attorney and counselor and as a n
officer of the court. It is the duty of every attorney to conduc t
himself or herself at all times in conformity with standards imposed
on members of the bar as a condition of the privilege to practice law.
These standards include, but are not limited to, the rules of
professional responsibility and the rules of judicial conduct that are
adopted by the Supreme Court.” MCR 9.103(A). Grounds fo r
discipline are set forth in MCR 9.104.
The authority to supervise and discipline Michigan attorney s
derives from the state constitution and rests with the Michiga n
Supreme Court. Schlossberg v State Bar Grievance Bd, 388 Mich 389,
395 (1972), citing Const 1963, art 6 § 5. This constitutional
responsibility is discharged, in turn, by the Attorney Grievance
Commission (acting as the Supreme Court’s prosecution arm) and
the Attorney Discipline Board (acting as the Supreme Court’ s
adjudicative arm). MCR 9.100 et seq.
“Michigan has a long tradition of judicial oversight of the ethical
conduct of its court officers.” Evans & Luptak, PLC v Lizza, 251 Mic h
App 187, 194 (2002). “To the extent that misconduct occurs i n
discovery, or at any point in litigation, a trial court has the authority
to sanction litigants and their counsel.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v
Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ n 10 (2025); see als o
Maldonado v Ford Motor Co, 476 Mich 372, 389 (2006). All Michiga n
judges have an independent responsibility to supervise the ethical
conduct of attorneys who appear in their courtrooms. Attorney Gen v
Mich Pub Serv Comm, 243 Mich App 487, 491-492 (2000). This
tradition is reflected in the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct;
MCJC 3(B)(3) provides that “[a] judge should take or institute
appropriate disciplinary measures against a judge or lawyer for
Page 1-24 Michigan Judicial Institute

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.7
unprofessional conduct of which the judge may become aware.”
The Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct require lawyers t o
report attorney misconduct. MRPC 8.3.
B. Motion to Disqualify Attorney
Although not specifically addressed by court rule, caselaw suggest s
that the court has the authority to consider a motion to disqualify
counsel. Rymal v Baergen, 262 Mich App 274, 316-322 (2004); Evans &
Luptak, PLC v Lizza, 251 Mich App 187, 193-203 (2002). Typically, a
motion to disqualify is based on an alleged conflict of interest. See
MRPC 1.7; MRPC 1.8; MRPC 1.9. Another potential ground for
disqualification may arise if the lawyer is a potential witness. MRPC
3.7. However, MRPC 3.7 does not prohibit “a lawyer fro m
appearing as attorney of record in a case in which the lawyer is a
party and is representing themselves.” MRPC 3.7(c).
To disqualify an attorney based on MRPC 1.7(a) (prohibiting a
lawyer from representing two clients with directly adverse
interests), the court must undertake a two-step analysis. Avink v
SMG, 282 Mich App 110, 117-118 (2009). First, it must “determine
whether a lawyer’s representation of a client will be ‘directly
adverse’ to the interest of another client.” Id. at 117. The Cour t
explained that “[c]lients’ interests are directly adverse when one
client sues another client.” Id. Second, the court must evaluate
reasonable belief and consent. Id. at 118. If the court concludes that a
directly adverse interest exists, it must disqualify the lawyer unles s
“(a) the attorney reasonably believes the dual representation will
not adversely affect the attorney-client relationship with the other
client and (b) both clients consent after consultation.” Id.
C. Standard of Review
Whether a conflict of interest exists is a question of fact that i s
reviewed for clear error. Avink v SMG, 282 Mich App 110, 116 (2009).
“A trial court’s findings of fact are clearly erroneous only if [the
Court] is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake wa s
made.” Id. The application of “ethical norms” to a decision whether
to disqualify counsel is reviewed de novo. Id.
1.7 Plaintiff’s Conduct - Wrongful Conduct Rule
The wrongful-conduct rule “may preclude a civil cause of action if i n
order to establish his cause of action, a plaintiff must rely, in whole or i n
part, on an illegal or immoral act or transaction to which he is a party. ”
Soaring Pine Cap Real Estate and Debt Fund II LLC v Park Street Group Realt y
Servs LLC, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2023) (cleaned up). The rule “stems fro m
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-25
=== Page 48 ===
Section 1.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
the sound public policy that ‘courts should not lend their aid to a plaintif f
who founded his cause of action on his own illegal conduct.’” Varela v
Spanski, 329 Mich App 58, 81 (2019), quoting Orzel v Scott Drug Co, 449
Mich 550, 559 (1995).
The wrongful-conduct rule “operates to deny relief if the claim is based
on the plaintiff’s illegal conduct, a casual connection exists between tha t
conduct and the damages sought, and the defendant is not more culpabl e
than the plaintiff.” Varela, 329 Mich App at 83 (holding the wrongful-
conduct rule was applicable to plaintiff’s various claims regarding a
partnership agreement to develop a marijuana grow operation that fell
outside the confines of the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act). “For th e
wrongful-conduct rule to apply to a given case, plaintiff’s conduct mus t
be prohibited or almost entirely prohibited under a penal or criminal
statute. . . . However, the mere fact that a plaintiff engaged in illega l
conduct at the time of his injury does not mean that his claim i s
automatically barred under the wrongful-conduct rule. Where an ac t
amounts to a violation of a safety statute, such as traffic and speed law s
or requirements for a safe workplace, the plaintiff’s act, while illegal,
does not rise to the level of serious misconduct sufficient to bar a cause o f
action by application of the wrongful-conduct rule.” Soaring Pine Capita l
Real Estate and Debt Fund II, LLC, 337 Mich App at 553, 556 (cleaned up)
(noting that the wrongful-conduct rule is not prohibited simply because a
statute provides for a criminal punishment; “a criminal statute will hav e
a criminal punishment, but . . . in addition to that potential criminal
penalty, a party is also not permitted to obtain civil damages on the basi s
of that criminal conduct”).
“In other words, the [wrongful-conduct] rule will bar recovery if (1) th e
plaintiff’s conduct is prohibited or almost entirely prohibited under a
penal or criminal statute, (2) a sufficient causal nexus exists between th e
plaintiff’s illegal conduct and the plaintiff’s asserted damages, and (3) th e
defendant’s culpability is not greater than the plaintiff’s culpability. ”
Masrur v Regents of the Univ of Mich, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2022)
(cleaned up). However, under the insanity exception to the wrongful-
conduct rule, “a plaintiff may, under some circumstances, pursue a cause
of action based on an illegal act committed while the plaintiff was legall y
insane.” Id. at ___. Nonetheless, “[a]n adjudication of criminal
responsibility precludes the application of the insanity exception to th e
wrongful-conduct rule.” Id. at ___. In Masrur, the Court held tha t
plaintiff’s nolo contendere but mentally ill plea in his criminal proceeding
“constituted an adjudication of criminal responsibility” and “wa s
admissible against him in [his medical malpractice action].” Id. at ___.
Accordingly, the Masrur Court held that plaintiff’s plea “preclude[d] a
finding that he was not legally responsible for [a] homicide, or a findin g
that he was legally insane at the time he committed it,” and concluded
that plaintiff’s “conduct bars plaintiff’s recovery under the wrongful-
conduct rule as a matter of law.” Id. at ___.

1.8 Contempt of Court
“Michigan courts have, as an inherent power, the power at common la w
to punish all contempts of court.” In re Contempt of Dougherty, 429 Mic h
81, 91 n 14 (1987). “This contempt power inheres in the judicial powe r
vested in [the Michigan Supreme Court], the Court of Appeals, and th e
circuit and probate courts by Const 1963, art 6, § 1.” Dougherty, 429 Mic h
at 91 n 14. Further, the Michigan Legislature has enacted numerou s
statutes providing for the use of the contempt power. See, e.g., MCL
600.1701.
For a detailed discussion on contempt of court, see the Michigan Judicial
Institute’s Contempt of Court Benchbook.
1.9 Judicial Disqualification
MCR 2.003(C) sets out the grounds for disqualification of a judge. The
Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct provides that “[a] judge should rais e
the issue of disqualification whenever the judge has cause to believe tha t
grounds for disqualification may exist under MCR 2.003(C).” People v
Loew, ___ Mich ___, ___ n 1 (2024), quoting MCJC 3(C). However, “ a
judge’s violation of the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct is not a legall y
recognized basis for relief.”Loew, ___ Mich at ___ (stating that “the canon s
do not grant litigants any substantive or procedural rights”).
Under MCR 2.003(C)(1)(b)(i), disqualification of a judge is warranted if,
“based on objective and reasonable perceptions,” the judge has “a seriou s
risk of actual bias impacting the due process rights of a party” as set fort h
in Caperton v Massey, 556 US 868 (2009). Loew, ___ Mich at ___, quotin g
MCR 2.003(C)(1)(b)(i). “Due process does not require a judge to recuse
herself unless a judge is actually biased, or, if there is no evidence that th e
judge is actually biased, unless the situation is one in which experienc e
teaches that the probability of actual bias on the part of the judge o r
decisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.” Loew, __ _
Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citations omitted).
However, “even if due process does not require a judge to recuse herself,
MCR 2.003(C)(1)(b)(ii) may still require a judge to disqualify herself if th e
judge, based on objective and reasonable perceptions, has failed t o
adhere to the appearance of impropriety standard set forth in Canon 2 o f
the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct.” Loew, ___ Mich at ___ (cleaned
up). MCJC 2(A) requires judges to “avoid all impropriety and
appearance of impropriety.” “To decide whether a judge has failed t o
avoid the appearance of impropriety,” Michigan courts “conside r
whether the judge’s conduct would create in reasonable minds a
perception that the judge’s ability to carry out judicial responsibilitie s
with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired.” Loew, ___ Mic h

at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, court s
“consider whether an ordinary person might reasonably question th e
judge’s integrity, impartiality, or competence on the basis of the judge’ s
observable conduct.” Id. at ___. “There is a strong presumption of judicia l
impartiality, and a party arguing otherwise bears a heavy burden to rebu t
this presumption.” Id. at ___.
26
“[MCJC 3(A)(5) ] prohibits a judge from communicating with a party t o
a legal proceeding outside the presence of opposing counsel in mos t
instances.” Loew, ___ Mich at ___ (noting that “the trial judge’s violation
of this canon is relevant to deciding whether she failed to adhere to th e
appearance-of-impropriety standard”). “In a word, a judge may no t
initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, but a judge ma y
allow ex parte communications for administrative purposes, so long a s
the judge reasonably believes that no party or counsel for a party will
gain a procedural or tactical advantage and the judge promptly disclose s
the communication.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
27
Although MCJC 3(A)(5)(a) provides that “a judge may allow ex part e
communications for administrative purposes,” the Loew Court wa s
“skeptical that this means a judge may initiate ex parte communication s
for administrative purposes.” Loew, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation mark s
omitted). “Divorced from context perhaps, the phrase ‘communication s
for administrative purposes’ could plausibly refer to any communicatio n
made for the purpose of managing or supervising the process o f
something, no matter what that something is.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
“But this phrase appears in the context of a judicial canon regulating a
judge’s conduct in the performance of her adjudicative responsibilities. ”
Id. at ___. Accordingly, “‘communications for administrative purposes’
means those communications made for the purpose of managing o r
executing a pending or impending proceeding.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
In Loew, the trial judge exchanged several e-mails with the county
prosecutor discussing testimony given by two law enforcement officer s
during defendant’s jury trial. Id. at ___. “In her e-mails, the trial judg e
expressed concern about mistakes law enforcement had made in it s
investigation and asked questions related to why those mistakes ha d
occurred.” Id. at ___. “The trial judge never notified defendant or defens e
counsel of these e-mails or their contents.” Id. at ___. The Loew Cour t
determined that “the trial judge commenting about the trooper’ s
investigation, asking whether the Michigan State Police has detectives,
and asking why the victim was not referred for a medical examinatio n
were not ‘communications . . . for administrative purposes,’ at least no t
28
as that phrase is used in [MCJC 3(A)(5)(a) ].” Loew, ___ Mich at ___.

“Because the trial judge’s ex parte communications with [the prosecutor ]
were not made for the purpose of managing or executing a pending o r
29
impending proceeding, they violated [MCJC 3(A)(5)(a) ].” Loew, __ _
Mich at ___.
“No matter the content of the ex parte communications, it is a gros s
breach of the appearance of justice when a party’s principal adversary i s
given private access to the ear of the court.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Thi s
is not to suggest that one instance of ex parte communications alway s
requires a judge to disqualify herself.” Id. at ___ (“A trial judge mus t
recuse himself or herself only when the ex parte communication poses a
threat to the judge’s impartiality.”) (cleaned up). “Depending on th e
circumstances, a brief ex parte exchange concerning a matter unrelated t o
the defendant or the proceeding might not create in reasonable minds a
perception that the judge is biased.” Id. at ___.
The Loew Court held “that an ordinary person might still reasonably
question her impartiality” even though “the trial judge’s communication s
[did] not show she was actually biased or that there was a n
unconstitutionally high probability she was actually biased.” Id. at ___.
The trial judge’s ex parte communications with the prosecutor “was no t
about some matter unrelated to defendant or his trial.” Id. at ___. “I n
response to witness testimony, while presiding over defendant’s trial, th e
trial judge privately e-mailed [the prosecutor] expressing concern abou t
law enforcement’s missteps in its investigation of defendant’s cas e
specifically and asking why these missteps occurred.” Id. at ___. “No t
only did the trial judge give [the prosecutor] private access to her ear,
considering the contents of her communications, one might reasonabl y
question whether the trial judge was interested in seeing the prosecutio n
succeed or seeing defendant convicted.” Id. at ___ (quotation mark s
omitted) (holding that “the trial judge’s private exchange with the elected
prosecutor violated the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct”). Thus, “th e
trial judge should have known that grounds for her disqualificatio n
might have existed under MCR 2.003(C)(1)(b)(ii).” Loew, ___ Mich at ___.
Pursuant to MCJC 3(C), the trial judge “should have raised the issue o f
her disqualification sua sponte” and “should have recused herself unde r
MCR 2.003(C)(1)(b)(ii).” Loew, ___ Mich at ___. The Loew Court opined
that “[t]he trial judge’s actions fell short of the high ethical standards tha t
Michigan jurists are expected to uphold, and regrettably, her behavio r
has the potential to erode public confidence in the integrity of our justic e
system.” Id. at ___ (holding defendant was not entitled to a new trial
under MCR 6.431(B) because “the trial judge’s failure to recuse hersel f
did not result in a miscarriage of justice at defendant’s trial or depriv e
defendant of any constitutional right”).

“[A]n adverse ruling is not a sufficient reason for disqualification . . . ,
even if that ruling is later reversed.” Swain v Morse, 332 Mich App 510,
538 (2020). The trial court’s factual findings on a motion fo r
disqualification are reviewed for an abuse of discretion; however, th e
applications of the facts to the law is reviewed de novo. Van Buren Charter
Twp v Garter Belt Inc, 258 Mich App 594, 598 (2003).

Judicial Institute’s publication, Judicial Disqualification in Michigan. Se e

1.10 Pro Se Litigants
In both civil and criminal cases, a party has a right to represent himself o r
herself. Const 1963, art 1, § 13. See also MCL 600.1430; MCL 763.1.
Individuals who represent themselves are held to the same standards a s
members of the state bar. Baird v Baird, 368 Mich 536, 539 (1962) (notin g
that the trial court warned the defendant he should secure counsel);
Totman v Royal Oak School Dist, 135 Mich App 121, 126 (1984). A n
appellate court will not overlook a party’s tactical errors or conside r
documentary evidence that was not submitted to the trial court merel y
because a party acted in propria persona. Amorello v Monsanto Corp, 186
Mich App 324, 330-331 (1990); Bachor v Detroit, 49 Mich App 507, 51 2
(1973) (noting that “[a]ppearance in pro per does not excuse all
application of court rules”). When a litigant elects to proceed withou t
counsel, the litigant is “bound by the burdens that accompany suc h
election.” Hoven v Hoven, 9 Mich App 168, 174 (1967).
Committee Tips:
No special warnings or cautions are required ;
however, it is good practice to caution the pro se
litigant that he or she may wish to consult with
and be represented by an attorney and that he
or she should not expect special treatment
because he or she is a pro se litigant.
The court may reference particular statutes,
court rules, or rules of evidence that may have
significance in a particular case.
Explain to a pro se litigant that he or she does
not have to testify, but if testifying, he or she
may be subjected to cross-examination.
Page 1-30 Michigan Judicial Institute

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.10
Although a party has a right to represent himself or herself, an individual
may not represent another person or entity. See MCL 600.916
(unauthorized practice of law); Shenkman v Bragman, 261 Mich App 412,
416 (2004) (finding that the appellant was representing his grandfather’ s
estate, not himself, and was therefore engaged in the unauthorized
practice of law). A corporation “can appear only by attorney regardles s
of whether it is interested in its own corporate capacity or in a fiduciar y
capacity.” Peters Prod, Inc v Desnick Broadcasting Co, 171 Mich App 283,
287 (1988), citing Detroit Bar Ass’n v Union Guardian Trust Co, 282 Mich
707, 711 (1938). Also, a minor’s next friend cannot act as the minor’ s
attorney unless he or she is an attorney. Marquette Prison Warden v
Meadows, 114 Mich App 121, 124 (1982). Finally, a personal representative
may not represent an estate. Shenkman, 261 Mich App at 416 (2004).
“[A] person who represents himself or herself cannot recover actual
attorney fees even if the pro se individual is a licensed attorney.” Omdah l
v West Iron Co Bd of Ed, 478 Mich 423, 432 (2007). The phrase “actual
attorney fees” requires that an agency relationship exist between a n
attorney and the attorney’s client and that an attorney be acting on behal f
of a client separate from the attorney. Id.
Facilitating ability of litigants to be fairly heard. “A judge may mak e
reasonable efforts, consistent with the law, court rules, and rules of
evidence, to facilitate the ability of all litigants, including self-represented
litigants, to be fairly heard.” MCJC 3(A)(4). “In the interest of ensuring
fairness and access to justice, judges may make reasonable efforts tha t
help self-represented litigants to understand the proceedings and
applicable procedural requirements, secure legal assistance, and be heard
according to law.” MCJC 3(A)(4)(a). “The judge should be careful that the
reasonable efforts do not give self-represented litigants an unfai r
advantage or create an appearance of judicial partiality.” Id. “In som e
circumstances, particular efforts for self- represented litigants ar e
required by decisional or other law.” Id. “In other circumstances,
potential efforts are within the judge’s discretion.” Id. “Reasonable effort s
that a judge may take in the exercise of such discretion include, but ar e
not limited to:
(i) Construe pleadings to facilitate consideration of the issue s
raised.
(ii) Provide brief information or explanation about the
proceedings.
(iii) Ask neutral questions to elicit or clarify information.

(iv) Modify the traditional manner or order of takin g
evidence.
(v) Refer litigants to any resources available to assist in the
preparation of the case or enforcement and compliance wit h
any order.
(vi) Inform litigants what will be happening next in the cas e
and what is expected of them.” MCJC 3(A)(4)(b).
1.11 Waiver of Fees
30
Generally, filing fees are required in all cases. The trial court fe e
schedules are available here.
When properly requested, MCR 2.002 requires a trial court to relieve a n
indigent person of his or her obligation to pay filing fees and assures tha t
a person will not be denied access to the courts on the basis of indigence.
See MCR 2.002. “Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002],
courts must enable a litigant who seeks a fee waiver to do so by a n
entirely electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L).
31
Except as provided in MCR 2.002(I), for purposes of MCR 2.002, fees
applies only to fees required by MCL 600.857, MCL 600.878,
MCL 600.880–MCL 600.880c, MCL 600.1027, MCL 600.1986,
MCL 600.2529, MCL 600.5756, MCL 600.8371, MCL 600.8420,
MCL 700.2517, MCL 700.5104, and MCL 722.717. MCR 2.002(A)(2).
A. Who Qualifies for Waiver or Suspension
“Only an individual is eligible for the waiver of fees under [MCR
2.002].” MCR 2.002(A)(1). “A private or public organization is no t
eligible for a waiver of fees unless an applicable statue provides tha t
no fee(s) shall be required.” Id.
32
Assuming a proper request has been made, see MCR 2.002(B),
certain individuals are entitled to the waiver of fees, see MCR
2.002(C)-(D) and MCR 2.002(F). “Notwithstanding any other
provision of [MCR 2.002], courts must enable a litigant who seeks a
30However, there are some instances in which fees are not required. See, e.g., MCL 722.727 (in proceeding s
under the paternity act, no fees are required for commencement of suit, filing, decree or judgment, o r
stenographer); MCL 722.904(2)(f) (no fee for minors regarding self-consent to an abortion); MCR 3.703(A)
(no fees for filing a personal protection action).
31 MCR 2.002(I) provides special procedures and requirements where an indigent person requests servic e
by publication. See Section 1.11(E) for more information.
32 See Section 1.11(B) for more information on proper requests to waive filing fees.

fee waiver to do so by an entirely electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L).
“If a party shows that he or she is receiving any form of means-
[33]
tested public assistance, the clerk of the court must waiv e
payment of fees as to that party on a form approved by the State
Court Administrative Office.” MCR 2.002(C). “If a party i s
represented by a legal services program that is a grantee of the
federal Legal Services Corporation or the Michigan State Bar
Foundation, or by a law school clinic that provides services on the
basis of indigence, the clerk of the court must waive payment of fee s
as to that party on a form approved by the State Cour t
Administrative Office.” MCR 2.002(D).
“If the clerk of the court is unable to waive fees under [MCR
2.002(C) or MCR 2.002(D)], the clerk shall immediately submit th e
request for judicial review.” MCR 2.002(E).
“If an individual shows that he or she is unable because of
indigence to pay fees, the court shall order those fees waived.” MCR
2.002(F). “The court must waive fees when the individual lives in a
household with gross income under 125% of the federal poverty
guidelines. The court must also waive fees when gross household
income is above 125% of the federal poverty guidelines if the
payment of fees would constitute a financial hardship on the
individual.” Id.
MCR 2.002 “places the initial burden of establishing indigence o n
the petitioner requesting a waiver of filing fees.” Lewis v Dep’t of
Corrections, 232 Mich App 575, 579 (1998) (construing MCR
34
2.002(F)) .
B. Proper Request to Waive Filing Fees
“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002], courts mus t
enable a litigant who seeks a fee waiver to do so by an entirely
electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L). “Waiver of filing fees for
prisoners who are under the jurisdiction of the Michiga n
Department of Corrections [(MDOC)] is governed by MCL 600.2963
and as provided in [MCR 2.002].” MCR 2.002(A)(3).
The individual requesting a waiver of fees under MCR 2.002(C)-(D)
35
or MCR 2.002(F) must file SCAO’s fee waiver request form. MCR
33“[M]eans-tested public assistance includes but is not limited to: (1) Food Assistance Program through the
State of Michigan; (2) Medicaid; (3) Family Independence Program through the State of Michigan; (4)
Women, Infants, and Children benefits; (5) Supplemental Security Income through the federa l
government; or (6) Any other federal, state, or locally administered means-tested income or benefit.” MC R
2.002(C).
34Formerly MCR 2.002(D).

Section 1.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2.002(B). “If the request is being made by a prisoner under th e
jurisdiction of the [MDOC], the prisoner must also file a certified
copy of their institutional account showing the current balance and
a 12-month history of any deposits and withdrawals.” Id. “Th e
request must be verified in accordance with MCR 1.109(D)(3)(b) an d
may be signed either (1) by the individual in whose behalf the
request is made; or (2) by a person having knowledge of the fact s
required to be shown, if the individual in whose behalf the reques t
is made is unable to sign it because of minority or other disability.”
MCR 2.002(B). If the court finds that the form is incomplete or has a
reasonable belief that the request is inaccurate, “the court may
conduct further inquiries reasonably necessary to prove indigence
or financial hardship.” MCR 2.002(K). Any hearing on thes e
inquiries must be held on the record, and the notice of hearing mus t
indicate the issues subject to further inquiry. Id.
C. Domestic Relations Cases
“If a party entitled to relief in an action for divorce, separate
maintenance, annulment, or affirmation of marriage is qualified for
a waiver of filing fees under [MCR 2.002(C)-(D) or MCR 2.002(F)]
and is also entitled to an order requiring the other party to pay
attorney fees, the court shall order waiver of payment of those fee s
and shall require the other party to pay them, unless the other party
is also qualified to have filing fees waived under [MCR 2.002(C)-(D)
or MCR 2.002(F)]. MCR 2.002(H).
“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002], courts mus t
enable a litigant who seeks a fee waiver to do so by an entirely
electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L).
D. Grant or Denial of a Request to Waive Fees
Waivers processed by the clerk of the court do not require an order
by the judge. See MCR 2.002(C)-(D); MCR 2.002(G) (only requirin g
an order when the judge decides the waiver request). Waiver
requests reviewed by the court, see MCR 2.002(E)-(F), require entry
of an order granting or denying the request within three busines s
days, and the order must be nonpublic. MCR 2.002(G). “If required
financial information is not provided in the waiver request, the
judge may deny the waiver.” Id. Alternatively, if the court finds th e
waiver request incomplete or reasonably believes it is inaccurate, i t
may conduct further inquiries, including a hearing on the record.
MCR 2.002(K).
35The information contained on the form must be nonpublic. MCR 2.002(B).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.11
“An order denying [the request] shall indicate the reason for denial.
[An] order granting [the] request must include a statement that the
person for whom fees are waived is required to notify the cour t
when the reason for the waiver no longer exists.” MCR 2.002(G).
“Except as otherwise provided in [MCR 2.002(G)(2)(a)], if the cour t
denies a request for fee waiver, the individual may file a request for
de novo review within 14 days of the notice denying the waiver. ”
MCR 2.002(G)(2)(a). “A prisoner under the jurisdiction of th e
Michigan Department of Corrections may file the de novo review
request within 21 days of the notice denying the waiver.” Id. “There
is no motion fee for the request. A request for de novo review
automatically stays the case or preserves the filing date until the
review is decided. A de novo review must be held within 14 days of
receiving the request.” Id. The de novo review must be conducted
by someone other than the judge who made the original decision.
See MCR 2.002(G)(2)(c)(i) (requiring either the chief judge o r
another judge assigned by the state court administrator to conduc t
the de novo review).
“If the court holds a hearing on the request for de novo review, i t
shall be closed and held on the record. The clerk of the court shall
serve notice of the review at least 9 days before the time set for the
hearing if served by mail, or at least 7 days before the time set for
the hearing if served by delivery under MCR 2.107(C)(1) or [MCR
36
2.107(C)(2). The Michigan Rules of Evidence do not apply at this
hearing.” MCR 2.002(G)(2)(b)(i). “If a hearing is held, the individual
shall bring documents to verify the statements made in the fee
waiver request and request for de novo review. The court may
question the individual regarding the statements made in the
requests.” MCR 2.002(G)(2)(b)(ii).
“The court shall enter an order reflecting its decision on the de nov o
review. If the court denies the request, it shall explain its reasoning
in the order.” MCR 2.002(G)(2)(c)(ii).
E. Payment of Service Fees and Costs of Publication
“If payment of fees has been waived for an individual and service of
process must be made by an official process server or by
publication, the court shall order the service fees or costs of
publication paid by the county or funding unit in which the action i s

process except for case initiation must be performed using electronic means (e-Filing where available,
email, or fax, where available) to the greatest extent possible. Email transmission does not requir e
agreement by the other party(s) but should otherwise comply as much as possible with the provisions of
[MCR 2.107(C)(4)].” MCR 2.107(G).

Section 1.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
pending, if the individual files an ex parte affidavit stating fact s
showing the necessity for that type of service of process. If known a t
the time, the affidavit may be included in or with the request t o
waive fees.” MCR 2.002(I).
F. Reinstatement of Requirement for Payment of Fees
Note: The cases discussed in this subsection were published befor e
MCR 2.002 was amended by ADM File No. 2002-37 and 2018-20,
effective January 1 and 23, 2019, respectively. Reference t o
suspensions have been removed from the case summaries, as well
was references to costs. In addition, the amendment to MCR 2.002
included amendments regarding reinstating the requirement to pay
fees. It is unclear if these amendments (which now specifically
require a finding of fact before reinstating the obligation to pay)
impact the analysis in the cases discussed.
“If the payment of fees has been waived under [MCR 2.002], the
court may on its own initiative order the individual for whom the
fees were waived to pay those fees when, upon a finding of fact, the
court determines the reason for the waiver no longer exists.” MCR
2.002(J).
Before reinstating the requirement to pay the waived fees, the “trial
court must determine whether the litigant is indigent at the time of
the revocation of the waiver[.]” Martin v Dep’t of Corrections (On
Remand), 201 Mich App 331, 335 (1993). A trial court reinstating th e
obligation to pay filing fees is not required to establish a petitioner’ s
indigency in any particular manner. Lewis v Dep’t of Corrections, 23 2
Mich App 575, 582 (1998) (holding that it was “proper that the cour t
attempted to ascertain petitioner’s financial status by requiring hi m
to supply the relevant information”).
G. Prisoners
Fee waiver issues frequently arise in the context of litigatio n
initiated by prisoners. “Waiver of filing fees for prisoners who are
under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Correction s
[(MDOC)] is governed by MCL 600.2963 and as provided in [MCR
2.002].” MCR 2.002(A)(3).
MCL 600.2963 addresses claims of indigency in connection wit h
prisoners’ civil actions. “MCL 600.2963 requires that a prisoner
pursuing a civil action be liable for filing fees.” Johnson v Lakeland
Correctional Facility Warden, 501 Mich 920 (2017). “If the request i s
being made by a prisoner under the jurisdiction of the [MDOC], the
prisoner must also file a certified copy of their institutional accoun t
showing the current balance and a 12-month history of any deposit s
Page 1-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 59 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.11
and withdrawals.” MCR 2.002(B); MCL 600.2963(1). MCL 600.2963
sets out requirements for payment of filing fees based on the
prisoner’s financial records. MCL 600.2963(2)-(6). Incarceration
cannot be the “sole basis” for a determination of indigency, but a
prisoner must be permitted to commence a civil action or file a n
appeal even if he or she has no assets and no means by which to pay
the initial partial filing fee, and the court may suspend or waive the
filing fees and costs under MCL 600.2963(1). MCL 600.2963(7).
However, if the reason for waiver no longer exists, the court mus t
reinstate the order to pay the fees. Id. A trial court’s “discretio n
regarding the claim of indigency is limited to whether the prisoner
must pay the filing fee in full immediately, in part, over a period, or
at a later time.” Keenan v Dep’t of Corrections, 250 Mich App 628, 63 5
(2002), citing MCL 600.2963(2), MCL 600.2963(3), MCL 600.2963(5),
and MCL 600.2963(7). If the court denies a request for a fee waive r
from a prisoner under the jurisdiction of the MDOC, “the clerk’ s
notice shall indicate that the prisoner must pay the full or partial
payment ordered by the court within 21 days after the date of the
order, or the filing will be rejected.” MCR 2.002(G)(1).
“A prisoner who has failed to pay outstanding fees and costs a s
required under this section shall not commence a new civil action or
appeal until the outstanding fees and costs have been paid.” MCL
600.2963(8). However, “MCL 600.2963(8) cannot constitutionally b e
applied to bar a complaint for superintending control over a n
underlying criminal case if the bar is based on outstanding fee s
owed by an indigent-prisoner plaintiff from an earlier case and the
prisoner-plaintiff lacks funds to pay those outstanding fees.” In re
Jackson (On Remand), 326 Mich App 629, 631-632 (2018). Whe n
dealing with “criminal cases,” there is a “’fla t
prohibition’ . . . against making access to ‘appellate processes’ tur n
on the ability to pay.” Id. at 635, citing MLB v SLJ, 519 US 102, 11 2
(1996). “[A] complaint for superintending control over a n
underlying criminal case must reasonably be recognized as a n
‘appellate process,’ . . . even though it is an original civil action, and
not formally an appeal, under Michigan procedural law.” Jackson,
326 Mich App at 637 (although the claim for superintending control
was “recognized as criminal in nature for purposes of the federal
constitutional right of access to the courts,” the claim remained
classified “as an original civil action subject to the fee-related
requirements of MCL 600.2963 (apart from an unconstitutional
application of MCL 600.2963(8))”).
While it is possible “[c]ases might arise in which a prisoner-plaintiff
in a civil action could establish entitlement to an exception to MCL

(2019). “The holding in Jackson was based on the heightene d

1.12 Appointment of Foreign Language Interpreter
A. Court Rule Regarding Foreign Language Interpreters
“The appointment of foreign language interpreters is governed by
MCR 1.111 . . . [.]” In re DRRR Guardianship, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025) (noting “the critical role that foreign language interpreter s
play in facilitating meaningful access to justice for those whose
English skills are lacking”). The purpose of MCR 1.111 is t o
“provide court-appointed foreign language interpreter s
for . . . [limited English proficient (LEP)] persons to support their
37
access to justice[.]” ADM File No. 2012-03. MCR 1.111, which
“focuses on the critical legal requirement[ of] meaningful access, ”
requires the court “to provide an interpreter for a party or witness if
the court determines one is needed for either the party or the
38
witness to meaningfully participate.” ADM File No. 2012-03. See
also MCR 1.111(B)(1).

B. Determining Whether to Appoint a Foreign Language
Interpreter
An interpreter must be appointed for a testifying witness or a party
if interpretation services “are necessary for the person t o
meaningfully participate in the case or court proceeding[.]” MCR
1.111(B)(1). The court has discretion to appoint an interpreter fo r
other persons. MCR 1.111(B)(2).
“Any doubts as to eligibility for interpreter services should be
resolved in favor of appointment of an interpreter.” MCR
1.111(F)(6). “At the time of determining eligibility, the court shall
inform the party or witness of the penalties for making a fals e
statement. The party has the continuing obligation to inform the
court of any change in financial status and, upon request of the
court, the party must submit financial information.” MCR
1.111(F)(7).
Committee Tips:
A Language Access Coordinator has been
designated in each court to assist with questions
or requests regarding appointment of foreign
language interpreters.
Whether to appoint multiple interpreters is in
the discretion of the trial court. See MCR
1.111(E)(1) and MCR 1.111(F)(3). The court rule s
were purposefully crafted to allow the trial
courts broad discretion to consider all of the
facts of any circumstance and decide for
themselves. For example, in a situation in which
a defendant and a victim both need an
interpreter, the court should seriously consider
appointing separate interpreters for each. The
court should avoid any appearance that
proceedings are not equitable.
“[O]nce a litigant or counsel requests an interpreter and the cour t
agrees to appoint one, the trial court has an ongoing obligatio n
under MCR 1.111(B)(1) to ensure that [the testifying witness or
party] receive[s] such interpretation services as [are] necessary t o
‘meaningfully participate in the case or court proceeding[.]” In re
DRRR Guardianship, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation mark s

and citation omitted) (holding that the court erred “in requiring
appellant to repeatedly request an interpreter, in violation of MCR
1.111(B)(1), despite having previously determined that a n
interpreter was necessary for [appellant’s sister] to meaningfully
participate in the case”).
1. Appointment for Witness or Party
“If a person requests a foreign language interpreter and th e
court determines such services are necessary for the person t o
meaningfully participate in the case or court proceeding, or o n
the court’s own determination that foreign languag e
interpreter services are necessary for a person to meaningfull y
participate in the case or court proceeding, the court shall
appoint a foreign language interpreter for that person if th e
person is a witness testifying in a civil or criminal case or cour t
proceeding or is a party.” MCR 1.111(B)(1).
“Under MCR 1.111(B)(1), when a party or witness requests a n
interpreter and the court determines such services ar e
necessary for meaningful participation, or when the cour t
makes that determination on its own, the court must appoin t
an interpreter.” In re DARL Guardianship, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2025). “Once this determination is made, the trial cour t
has a continuing obligation to ensure that interpreter service s
remain adequate throughout the proceedings, safeguardin g
the individual’s ability to fully understand and participate i n
the case.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, after the court grants a
request for an interpreter, “there [is] no need for [a testifyin g
witness or a party] to make additional requests for a n
interpreter.” In re DRRR Guardianship, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025).
In DRRR, “while the court had previously provided
[appellant] with an interpreter at initial proceedings, it erred
by failing to abide by its continuing obligation, under MCR
1.111(B)(1), to provide [appellant] with an interpreter at all
subsequent court proceedings.” DRRR, ___ Mich App at ___.
“Neither MCR 1.111 nor the court’s language access plan
require litigants to request an interpreter prior to eac h
proceeding if the court has already determined that the litigan t
needs an interpreter.” DRRR, ___ Mich App at ___. “The cour t
was obligated by MCR 1.111(F)(1) to provide an interprete r
until the proceedings were concluded.” DRRR, ___ Mich App
at ___ n 1 (holding that the trial court violated MCR 1.111(B)
when it “required appellant to make multiple requests for a n
interpreter”).
Page 1-40 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 63 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.12
“Whenever practicable, the interpreter must be certified by th e
State Court Administrative Office (SCAO).” DARL, ___ Mic h
App at ___, citing MCR 1.111(F)(1) and MCR 1.111(A)(4).
“However, when a SCAO-certified interpreter is no t
reasonably available, ‘after considering the gravity of th e
proceedings and whether the matter should be rescheduled, ’
the court may appoint a ‘qualified’ or ‘capable’ interpreter. ”
DARL, ___ Mich App at ___, citing MCR 1.111(F)(1) and MCR
1.111(F)(2). “MCR 1.111(A)(6) outlines the detailed criteria for
an interpreter to be considered ‘qualified.’” DARL, ___ Mic h
App at ___ n 3. “The court determines a potential interpreter’ s
capability through voir dire, during which the court assesse s
whether the interpreter can convey the intent and content o f
the speaker’s words sufficiently to allow the court to conduc t
the proceeding without prejudice to the speaker.” DARL, ___
Mich App at ___ n 4, citing MCR 1.111(F)(2).
In DARL, “petitioner requested an interpreter for her SIJ
[Special Immigrant Juvenile] hearing, and the court clearly wa s
required to procure one.” DARL, ___ Mich App at ___, citing
MCR 1.111(B)(1) and DRRR, ___ Mich App at ___. “However,
when petitioner’s counsel attended DARL’s virtual SIJ hearing,
she learned that no interpreter had been procured, so th e
hearing would need to be rescheduled.” DARL, ___ Mich Ap p
at ___. “On appeal, petitioner argue[d] that the court erred
when petitioner’s counsel suggested the use of a virtual
language interpreting service, but the trial court chose instead
to reschedule the hearing, which took place approximately tw o
weeks later with an interpreter—before DARL’s eighteent h
birthday.” Id. at ___. But the Court of Appeals noted that
“although the trial court initially failed to procure a n
interpreter, the court took care to conduct the SIJ hearing wit h
the requisite interpreter and make its determinations befor e
DARL reached the age of majority.” Id. at ___. “Therefore, an y
initial failure to secure an interpreter at DARL’s SIJ hearing did
not deny her meaningful access to justice.” Id. at ___
(concluding that “the trial court’s decision to reschedule the SIJ
motion for a later date was [not] an unreasonable or
unprincipled decision”). “This stands in stark contrast to the
trial court in [DRRR], who refused to voir dire a present,
willing interpreter; refused to use the proffered virtual
interpreter; refused to recall the case when the petitione r
produced a certified, in-person interpreter; and ultimately,
delayed the case so long that the minor turned 18 years old an d
the court declined to take jurisdiction.” Id. at ___.

2. Appointment for Person Other than Witness or
Party
“The court may appoint a foreign language interpreter for a
person other than a party or witness who has a substantial
interest in the case or court proceeding.” MCR 1.111(B)(2).
3. Determining Whether Services are Necessary for
Meaningful Participation
“In order to determine whether the services of a foreig n
language interpreter are necessary for a person t o
meaningfully participate under [MCR 1.111(B)(1)], the cour t
shall rely upon a request by an LEP individual (or a reques t
made on behalf of an LEP individual) or prior notice in th e
record.” MCR 1.111(B)(3). “If no such requests have been
made, the court may conduct an examination of the person o n
the record to determine whether such services are necessary. ”
Id.
“During the examination, the court may use a foreign languag e
interpreter.” MCR 1.111(B)(3). “For purposes of thi s
examination, the court is not required to comply with th e
requirements of [MCR 1.111(F)] and the foreign languag e
interpreter may participate remotely.” MCR 1.111(B)(3).
4. Denying Request for Interpreter
“Any time a court denies a request for the appointment of a
foreign language interpreter . . . , it shall do so by written
order.” MCR 1.111(H)(1). “An LEP individual ma y
immediately request review of the denial of appointment of a
foreign language interpreter.” MCR 1.111(H)(2). “A request for
review must be submitted to the court within 56 days afte r
entry of the order.” Id.
“In a court having two or more judges, the chief judge shal l
decide the request for review de novo.” MCR 1.111(H)(2)(a).
“In a single-judge court, or if the denial was issued by a chie f
judge, the judge shall refer the request for review to the stat e
court administrator for assignment to another judge, who shall
decide the request de novo.” MCR 1.111(H)(2)(b).
If there is a pending request for review under MCR 1.111(H),
the underlying litigation is stayed and the request for revie w
must be decided on an expedited basis. MCR 1.111(H)(2)(c)-
(d).
Page 1-42 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 65 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.12
“No motion fee is required for a request for review mad e
under [MCR 1.111(H)].” MCR 1.111(H)(2)(e).
C. Waiver of Right to Interpreter
“A person may waive the right to a foreign language interpreter
established under [MCR 1.111(B)(1)] unless the court determine s
that the interpreter is required for the protection of the person’ s
rights and the integrity of the case or court proceeding.” MCR
1.111(C). “The court must find on the record that a person’s waiver
of an interpreter is knowing and voluntary.” Id. “When accepting
the person’s waiver, the court may use a foreign language
interpreter.” Id. “For purposes of this waiver, the court is no t
required to comply with the requirements of [MCR 1.111(F)] and the
foreign language interpreter may participate remotely.” Id.
D. Classifications of Foreign Language Interpreters
1. Certified Foreign Language Interpreters
“When the court appoints a foreign language interpreter unde r
[MCR 1.111(B)(1)], the court shall appoint a certified foreig n
language interpreter whenever practicable.” MCR 1.111(F)(1).
2. Qualified Foreign Language Interpreters
“If a certified foreign language interpreter is not reasonably
available, and after considering the gravity of the proceeding s
and whether the matter should be rescheduled, the court ma y
appoint a qualified foreign language interpreter who meets th e
qualifications in [MCR 1.111(A)(6)].” MCR 1.111(F)(1). “The
court shall make a record of its reasons for using a qualifie d
foreign language interpreter.” Id.
“As MCR 1.111(F)(1) suggests, a ‘qualified foreign languag e
interpreter’ differs from a ‘certified foreign languag e
interpreter,’ see MCR 1.111(A)(4).” In re DRRR Guardianship,
___ Mich App ___, ___ n 6 (2025).
3. Other Capable Person
“If neither a certified foreign language interpreter nor a
qualified foreign language interpreter is reasonably available,
and after considering the gravity of the proceeding and
whether the matter should be rescheduled, the court ma y
appoint a person whom the court determines through voir dir e
to be capable of conveying the intent and content of th e

Section 1.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
speaker’s words sufficiently to allow the court to conduct th e
proceeding without prejudice to the limited English proficien t
person.” MCR 1.111(F)(2).
“[T]he court erred when it failed to comply with MCR
1.111(F)(2) by refusing to voir dire or otherwise permi t
[appellant’s sister] to use the qualified interpreter who m
counsel brought to [a] hearing.” In re DRRR Guardianship, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “Although a certified foreig n
language translator was not present at the hearing, appellant’ s
attorney had a person capable of translating present at th e
hearing, as permitted under MCR 1.111(F)(2), yet the trial cour t
refused to accept her as a translator because she was no t
certified by the State Court Administrator’s Office (SCAO). ”
DRRR, ___ Mich App at ___. “[T]he sum of the trial court’ s
rationale for asserting that it could prevent use of a non-
certified interpreter was that requiring a certified foreig n
language interpreter was ‘the procedure’ and simply ‘how w e
run things here’, but those comments fall short of valid reason s
for requiring a certified foreign language interpreter.” DRRR,
___ Mich App at ___ n 8. “Had the court adhered to MCR
1.111(F)(2), it would have found that the proposed interpreter
had been speaking Spanish since she was five years old, tha t
she had a minor degree in Spanish from Michigan Stat e
University, and that she had been employed in variou s
positions that required her to translate English and Spanish i n
the United States and abroad.” DRRR, ___ Mich App at ___.
“The proposed interpreter was precisely the type of perso n
referenced in MCR 1.111(F)(2), i.e., a person ‘capable o f
conveying the intent and content of the speaker’s word s
sufficiently to allow the court to conduct’ the hearing withou t
prejudice to [appellant’s sister], who was not proficient i n
English.” DRRR, ___ Mich App at ___ (“conclud[ing] that th e
court made several critical errors, resulting in [appellant’ s
sister] being denied meaningful access to justice”).
4. Court Employee As Foreign Language Interpreter
“A court employee may interpret legal proceedings as follows:
(a) The court may employ a person as a n
interpreter. The employee must meet the minimu m
requirements for [certified foreign language, se e
MCR 1.111(A)(4)]. The state court administrato r
may authorize the court to hire a person who doe s
not meet the minimum requirements established
by [MCR 1.111(A)(4)] for good cause including the
unavailability of a certification test for the foreig n

=== Page 67 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.12
language and the absence of certified interpreter s
for the foreign language in the geographic area i n
which the court sits. The court seeking
authorization from the state court administrator
shall provide proof of the employee’s competency
to act as an interpreter and shall submit a plan for
the employee to meet the minimum requirement s
established by [MCR 1.111(A)(4)] within a
reasonable time.
(b) The court may use an employee as a n
interpreter if the employee meets the minimu m
requirements for interpreters established by [MCR
1.111] and is not otherwise disqualified.” MCR
1.111(E)(2).
E. Appointing More Than One Interpreter
In general, “[t]he court shall appoint a single interpreter for a case o r
court proceeding.” MCR 1.111(F)(3). However, “[t]he court ma y
appoint more than one interpreter after consideration of[:]
• the nature and duration of the proceeding;
• the number of parties in interest and witnesses requiring
an interpreter;
• the primary languages of those persons; and
• the quality of the remote technology that may be utilized
when deemed necessary by the court to ensure effective
communication in any case or court proceeding.” MCR
1.111(F)(3) (bullets added).
F. Avoiding Potential Conflicts of Interest
“The court should use all reasonable efforts to avoid potential
conflicts of interest when appointing a person as a foreign language
interpreter and shall state its reasons on the record for appointing
the person if any of the following applies:
(a) The interpreter is compensated by a business owne d
or controlled by a party or a witness;
(b) The interpreter is a friend, a family member, or a
household member of a party or witness;
(c) The interpreter is a potential witness;
(d) The interpreter is a law enforcement officer;

=== Page 68 ===
Section 1.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(e) The interpreter has a pecuniary or other interest i n
the outcome of the case;
(f) The appointment of the interpreter would not serv e
to protect a party’s rights or ensure the integrity of th e
proceedings;
(g) The interpreter does have, or may have, a perceive d
conflict of interest;
(h) The appointment of the interpreter creates a n
appearance of impropriety.” MCR 1.111(E)(1).
G. Recordings
“The court may make a recording of anything said by a foreig n
language interpreter or a limited English proficient person whil e
testifying or responding to a colloquy during those portions of the
proceedings.” MCR 1.111(D).
H. Interpreter Oath or Affirmation
“The court shall administer an oath or affirmation to a foreig n
language interpreter substantially conforming to the following:
‘Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will truly,
accurately, and impartially interpret in the matter no w
before the court and not divulge confidentia l
communications, so help you God?’” MCR 1.111(G).
I. Interpreter Costs
“The court may set reasonable compensation for interpreters wh o
are appointed by the court.” MCR 1.111(F)(4). “Court-appointed
interpreter costs are to be paid out of funds provided by law or by
the court.” Id.
“If a party is financially able to pay for interpretation costs, the cour t
may order the party to reimburse the court for all or a portion of
interpretation costs.” MCR 1.111(F)(5).
“Any time a court . . . orders reimbursement of interpretation costs,
it shall do so by written order.” MCR 1.111(H)(1).
“An LEP individual may immediately request review of . . . a n
assessment for the reimbursement of interpretation costs.” MCR
1.111(H)(2). “A request for review must be submitted to the cour t
within 56 days after entry of the order.” Id. “In a court having two or
more judges, the chief judge shall decide the request for review de

novo.” MCR 1.111(H)(2)(a). “In a single-judge court, or if the denial
was issued by a chief judge, the judge shall refer the request for
review to the state court administrator for assignment to another
judge, who shall decide the request de novo.” MCR 1.111(H)(2)(b).
If there is a pending request for review under MCR 1.111(H), the
underlying litigation is stayed and the request for review must be
decided on an expedited basis. MCR 1.111(H)(2)(c)-(d).
“No motion fee is required for a request for review made under
[MCR 1.111(H)].” MCR 1.111(H)(2)(e).
J. Standard of Review
Appellate courts review a trial court’s decision whether to appoin t
an interpreter for an abuse of discretion. In re DRRR Guardianship,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “A court abuses its discretion when it s
decision falls outside the range of reasonable and principled
outcomes.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).

1.13 Appointment of Interpreter for Deaf or Deaf-Blind
Person
A deaf or deaf-blind person has the right to a qualified interpreter and t o
meaningful participation in judicial or investigative proceedings. People v
Brannon, 194 Mich App 121, 127 (1992); Bednarski v Bednarksi, 141 Mic h
App 15, 19 (1985); MCL 393.503(3); MCL 393.504(1).
A. Determining Whether to Appoint an Interpreter for Deaf
or Deaf-Blind Person
1. Appointment for Witness or Party
“In any action before a court or a grand jury where a deaf or
deaf-blind person is a participant in the action, either as a
plaintiff, defendant, or witness, the court shall appoint a
qualified interpreter to interpret the proceedings to the deaf or
deaf-blind person, to interpret the deaf or deaf-blind person’ s
testimony or statements, and to assist in preparation of th e
action with the deaf or deaf-blind person’s counsel.” MCL
393.503(1).
“In a proceeding before an appointing authority, other than a
court, the appointing authority shall appoint a qualifie d
interpreter to interpret the proceedings to the deaf or deaf-

Section 1.13 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
blind person and to interpret the deaf or deaf-blind person’ s
testimony or statements in any proceeding before th e
appointing authority.” MCL 393.503(2).
“The Deaf Persons’ Interpreters Act . . . provides for th e
mandatory appointment of an interpreter in any action befor e
a court or a grand jury where a deaf person is a participant i n
the action, either as a plaintiff, defendant, or witness, t o
perform three specific functions: (1) to interpret th e
proceedings to the deaf person; (2) to interpret the dea f
person’s testimony or statements; and (3) to assist i n
preparation of the action with the deaf person.” Bednarski v
Bednarksi, 141 Mich App 15, 20 (1985) (the defendant wa s
entitled to a new trial where the procedure followed at trial
only satisfied the second function).
The trial court’s decision to deny the defendant’s motion for a
new trial based upon the failure of the court to appoint a n
interpreter on behalf of the defendant was insufficientl y
supported, and the Michigan Supreme Court remanded for
“supplemental findings as to why an interpreter was no t
appointed on the defendant’s behalf” where “the record
include[d] statements by the court that it was aware that th e
defendant had a hearing problem at the time the defendan t
waived his right to a jury trial . . . and during the trial itself[.]”
People v Thomas (Michael), 441 Mich 879 (1992) (“[t]he record
also contain[ed] an assertion by defense counsel during trial
that the defendant was 80% deaf and also suggest[ed] that th e
court appointed an interpreter for the defendant to assist i n
proceedings in another case that took place at about the sam e
time as or soon after the trial of this matter”). Id.
2. Notification of Need for/Right to Interpreter
“Each deaf or deaf-blind person whose appearance in an actio n
or other proceeding entitles the deaf or deaf-blind person to a
qualified interpreter shall provide reasonable notice to the
appointing authority of the need of a qualified interpreter
before the appearance.” MCL 393.504(1).
“An appointing authority, when it knows a deaf or deaf-blind
person is or will be coming before it, shall inform the deaf o r
deaf-blind person of the right to a qualified interpreter.” MCL
393.504(2). See also Bednarski v Bednarksi, 141 Mich App 15, 2 0
(1985) (“an appointing authority . . . who knows a deaf perso n
will be coming before it is obliged to inform the deaf person o f
the right to an interpreter”).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.13
3. Reasonable Proof of Deafness
“An appointing authority may require a person requesting th e
appointment of a qualified interpreter to furnish reasonabl e
proof of the person’s deafness, if the appointing authority ha s
reason to believe that the person is not deaf or deaf-blind. ”
MCL 393.504(3).
4. Making a Determination
“A trial court’s decision regarding whether an individual is a
deaf person is based upon factual findings[.]” People v Brannon,
194 Mich App 121, 127-128 (1992).
“A qualified interpreter shall not be appointed unless th e
appointing authority and the deaf or deaf-blind person make a
preliminary determination that the qualified interpreter is abl e
to readily communicate with the deaf or deaf-blind person and
to interpret the proceedings in which the deaf or deaf-blin d
person is involved.” MCL 393.503(4). “[T]he record should
affirmatively disclose that the required preliminar y
determination was made.” Bednarski v Bednarksi, 141 Mich App
15, 22 (1985).
“If a qualified interpreter states that the interpreter is unable t o
render a satisfactory interpretation and that an intermediar y
interpreter or deaf interpreter will improve the quality of the
interpretation, the appointing authority shall appoint a n
intermediary interpreter or deaf interpreter to assist th e
qualified interpreter.” MCL 393.503(5).
5. Fulfilling Requests
“The appointing authority shall channel requests for qualified
interpreters, intermediary interpreters, and deaf interpreters
through the division.” MCL 393.508(1). “The division shal l
compile and update annually a listing of qualified interpreters,
intermediary interpreters, and deaf interpreters and shall
make this listing available to an appointing authority that ma y
need the services of a qualified interpreter, intermediar y
interpreter, or deaf interpreter as required by [the Dea f
Persons’ Interpreters Act, MCL 393.501 et seq.]” MCL
393.508(2).

Committee Tip:
An ADA Coordinator or contact has been
designated in each court to assist with questions
or requests regarding accommodations for
individuals who are deaf, deaf-blind, or hard of
hearing.
B. Waiver of Right to Interpreter
“The right of a deaf or deaf-blind person to a qualified interprete r
shall not be waived except by a request for waiver in writing by the
deaf or deaf-blind person.” MCL 393.503(3).
“A written waiver of a plaintiff or defendant is subject to the
approval of the deaf or deaf-blind person’s counsel and the approval
of the appointing authority.” MCL 393.503(3). See also Bednarski v

C. Classifications of Interpreters for Deaf Person
“If an interpreter is required as an accommodation for a deaf o r
deaf-blind person under state or federal law, the interpreter shall be
a qualified interpreter.” MCL 393.503a. An interpreter may be a
qualified interpreter, a qualified oral interpreter, a qualified sig n
language interpreter, or an intermediary interpreter or dea f
interpreter. MCL 393.502(e)-(h).
D. Appointing More Than One Interpreter
In a situation where both parties and several additional witnesse s
were deaf, the Court of Appeals stated that “the provisions of [the
Deaf Persons’ Interpreters Act] require the appointment of a n
interpreter for each plaintiff and defendant, and a third interpreter
for the court, if necessary.” Bednarski v Bednarksi, 141 Mich App 15,
21 (1985).
39On February 22, 2016, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR)—Division of Deaf, Deaf-Blind,
and Hard of Hearing released its policies and procedures for certified interpreters who provide American
Sign Language (ASL) services enforcing Michigan’s Deaf Persons’ Interpreters Act and the Qualifie d
Interpreter-General Rules. For more information, see the State Court Administrative Office’s
Memorandum.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.13
E. Interpreter Oath or Affirmation
“Before a qualified interpreter participates in any action or other
proceeding because of an appointment under [the Deaf Persons’
Interpreters Act, MCL 393.501 et seq.], the qualified interpreter shall
make an oath or affirmation that the qualified interpreter will make
a true interpretation in an understandable manner to the deaf or
deaf-blind person for whom the qualified interpreter is appointed
and that the qualified interpreter will interpret the statements of the
deaf or deaf-blind person in the English language to the best of the
interpreter’s skill.” MCL 393.506(1).
The Court of Appeals noted that MCL 393.506(1) may have bee n
violated where “[p]rior to trial, counsel stipulated that the
interpreter would ‘paraphrase’ the answers of the witnesses t o
‘expedite’ the proceeding.” Bednarski v Bednarksi, 141 Mich App 15,
22 (1985). The Court recognized that “[d]ue to the conceptual nature
of sign language, a verbatim translation of oral testimony (or vice
versa) may not be possible”; “[h]owever, the very fact of th e
unavoidable translation difficulty renders the need for accurate and
skillful interpretation even more critical.” Id.
“The appointing authority shall provide recess periods as necessary
for the qualified interpreter when the qualified interpreter s o
indicates.” MCL 393.506(1).
“The information that the qualified interpreter, intermediar y
interpreter, or deaf interpreter gathers from the deaf or deaf-blin d
person pertaining to any action or other pending proceeding shall a t
all times remain confidential and privileged, unless the deaf or deaf-
blind person executes a written waiver allowing the information t o
be communicated to other persons and the deaf or deaf-blind
person is present at the time the information is communicated.”
MCL 393.506(2).
F. Interpreter Costs
“A court appointed interpreter, qualified interpreter, intermediar y
interpreter, or deaf interpreter shall be paid a fee by the court that i t
determines to be reasonable.” MCL 393.507(1).
“A qualified interpreter, intermediary interpreter, or deaf interpreter
appointed by an appointing authority other than a court shall b e
paid a fee by the appointing authority . . . out of funds available t o
the appropriate appointing authority.” MCL 393.507(1)-(2).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-51
=== Page 74 ===
Section 1.14 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“In addition, a qualified interpreter, intermediary interpreter, or
deaf interpreter shall be paid for his or her actual expenses for
travel, meals, and lodging.” MCL 393.507(1).
“A qualified interpreter appointed for the deaf or deaf-blind person
shall be available for the duration of the deaf or deaf-blind person’s
participation in the action or other proceeding.” MCL 393.507(3).
1.14 Communication Equipment
“A court may, on its own initiative or on the written request of a party,
direct that communication equipment be used for a motion hearing,
pretrial conference, scheduling conference, or status conference. Th e
court must give notice to the parties before directing on its own initiativ e
that communication equipment be used.” MCR 2.402(B).
“A party wanting to use communication equipment must submit a
written request to the court at least 7 days before the day on which suc h
equipment is sought to be used, and serve a copy on the other parties,
unless good cause is shown to waive this requirement. The requestin g
party also must provide a copy of the request to the office of the judge t o
whom the request is directed.” MCR 2.402(B).
“The court may, with the consent of all parties or for good cause, direc t
that the testimony of a witness be taken through communicatio n
equipment. A verbatim record of the proceeding must still be made. ”
MCR 2.402(B).
Unless the court directs otherwise, the party initiating the use o f
communication equipment bears the cost for its use. MCR 2.402(C). If the
court initiates the use of communication equipment, the cost must b e
shared equally among the parties. Id.

1.15 Videoconferencing
Consistent with the court rules, and subject to MCR 2.407(4), “courts may
determine the manner and extent of the use of videoconferencing
technology and may require participants to attend court proceedings b y
videoconferencing technology.” MCR 2.407(B)(2). “All proceeding s
occurring by videoconferencing are subject to requirements, standards,
and guidelines published by the [SCAO] and the criteria set forth i n
41
[MCR 2.407(C)].” MCR 2.407(B)(1).
40See Section 1.3(B) for additional information on judicial appearances by videoconferencing.
41See Section 1.15(C) for additional information on the criteria for videoconferencing.
Page 1-52 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 75 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 1.15
Additionally, “a court may, at the request of any participant, or su a
sponte, allow the use of videoconferencing technology by any participan t
in any civil proceeding.” MCR 2.408(A)(1). However, “[e]xcept as
otherwise provided in [MCR 2.408(A)(2)], the use of videoconferencing
technology shall not be used in bench or jury trials, or any civil
proceeding wherein the testimony of witnesses or presentation o f
evidence may occur, except in the discretion of the court after all partie s
have had notice and opportunity to be heard on the use o f
videoconferencing technology. MCR 2.408 “does not supersede a
participant’s ability to participate by telephonic means under MCR
2.402.” MCR 2.408(A)(3).
A participant may request to physically appear in person for an y
proceeding. MCR 2.407(B)(4). “If there is a request to appear in person, or
a participant is found to be unable to adequately use the technology, t o
hear or understand or be heard or understood, the presiding judge and
any attorney of record for said participant must appear in person wit h
the participant for said proceeding. Subject to [MCR 2.407(B)(5)], th e
court must allow other participants to participate usin g
videoconferencing technology.” MCR 2.407(B)(4).
A court may determine “that a case is not suited for videoconferencing,
and may require any hearing, even a proceeding categorized a s
presumptively subject to videoconferencing technology, to be conducted
in person.” MCR 2.407(B)(5). However, a court must “consider the factor s
listed in [MCR 2.407(C)]” and “state its decision and reasoning, either i n
writing or on the record, when requiring in-person proceedings in eac h
case where there is a presumption for the use of videoconferencin g
technology.” MCR 2.407(B)(5)(a)-(b).
Courts “must provide reasonable notice to participants of the time and
mode of a proceeding. If a proceeding will be held usin g
videoconferencing technology, the court must provide reasonable notic e
of the way(s) to access that proceeding.” MCR 2.407(B)(6). Courts mus t
also “allow a party and their counsel to engage in confidential
communication during a proceeding being conducted b y
videoconferencing technology.” MCR 2.407(B)(7). However, “trial court s
have the authority to direct and control the proceedings before them.” K2
Retail Constr Servs, Inc v West Lansing Retail Dev, LLC, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2025) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (holding that a trial
court may maintain control over the proceedings by ordering a party’ s
counsel to be muted at times during an oral hearing being held virtually).
In K2 Retail, “during hearings, counsel repeatedly gave nonresponsiv e
answers to the trial court’s direct questions.” Id. at ___. “Counse l
interrupted the court, including after the court asked counsel to sto p
speaking.” Id. at ___. “Counsel interrupted other counsel when the cour t
was addressing other counsel.” Id. at ___. “As a result, the court ordered
that [defendant’s] counsel be muted.” Id. at ___. “However, counsel wa s

=== Page 76 ===
Section 1.15 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
unmuted for the trial court to allow counsel to address issues.” Id. at ___.
The Court of Appeals held that defendant “was not entitled to an ora l
hearing, and even though it was given an oral hearing, counsel was no t
entitled to avoid any consequences for belligerent conduct.” Id. at ___.
“The [trial] court repeatedly warned counsel about counsel’s conduct. ”
Id. at ___ (concluding that “the sanction of being muted [was] relativel y
minor and directly tailored to curb counsel’s conduct”).
“If, during the course of a videoconference proceeding, the court or a
participant is unable to proceed due to failure of technology, the cour t
must reschedule the proceeding and promptly notify the participants o f
the rescheduled date and time and whether the proceeding will be held
using videoconferencing technology or in person.” MCR 2.407(B)(8). “All
proceedings that are held using videoconferencing technology o r
communication equipment must be recorded verbatim by the court wit h
the exception of hearings that are not required to be recorded by law. ”
MCR 2.407(B)(9). “Courts must provide access to a proceeding held usin g
videoconferencing technology to the public either during the proceedin g
or immediately after via access to a video recording of the proceeding,
unless the proceeding is closed or access would otherwise be limited b y
statute or rule.” MCR 2.407(B)(10).
See also MCL 600.2164a, which addresses videoconference testimony by
an expert witness at trial.
A. Use of Videoconferencing in Circuit Court
In circuit court, “[s]ubject to a determination by the court that the use of
videoconferencing technology is inappropriate for a particular cas e
under an analysis as contained in MCR 2.407(C), the use of
videoconferencing technology shall be presumed for:
(1) civil pretrials;
(2) early scheduling conferences under MCR 2.401(B);
(3) motions filed pursuant to MCR 2.119 regarding discovery;
(4) adjournments;
(5) modifications to scheduling orders;
(6) motions in limine;
(7) postjudgment collection or discovery matters;
(8) testimonial proofs for hearings under MCR 3.210(A)(4);
(9) motions to correct, strike, or amend pleadings; and

(10) motions pursuant to MCR 2.116.” MCR 2.407(B).
B. Use of Videoconferencing in District Court
In district court, “[s]ubject to a determination by the court that the use of
videoconferencing technology is inappropriate for a particular cas e
under an analysis as contained in MCR 2.407(C), the use of
videoconferencing technology shall be presumed for:
(1) civil pretrials;
(2) early scheduling conferences under MCR 2.401(B);
(3) motions filed pursuant to MCR 2.119 regarding discovery;
(4) adjournments;
(5) postjudgment collection matters; and
(6) motions to correct, strike, or amend pleadings.” MCR
2.407(C).
C. Criteria for Videoconferencing
“In determining in a particular case the use of videoconferencing
technology and the manner of proceeding with videoconferencing,
the court shall consider the following factors:
(1) The capabilities of the court and the parties t o
participate in a videoconference.
(2) Whether a specific articulable prejudice would
result.
(3) The convenience of the parties and the proposed
witness(es), the cost of producing the witness in perso n
in relation to the importance of the offered testimony,
and the potential to increase access to courts b y
allowing parties and/or their counsel to appear b y
videoconferencing technology.
(4) Whether the procedure would allow for full an d
effective cross-examination, especially when the cross-
examination would involve documents or othe r
exhibits.
(5) Whether the court has reason to believe that the
participants in this hearing will not be able to maintai n
the dignity, solemnity, and decorum of court whil e
using videoconferencing technology, or that the use o f
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 1-55
=== Page 78 ===
Section 1.15 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
videoconferencing technology will undermine th e
integrity, fairness, or effectiveness of the proceeding.
(6) Whether a physical liberty or other fundamenta l
interest is at stake in the proceeding.
(7) Whether the court can sufficiently control th e
participants in this hearing or matter so as to effectivel y
extend the courtroom to the remote location.
(8) Whether the use of videoconferencing technolog y
presents the person at a remote location in a diminishe d
or distorted sense that negatively reflects upon th e
individual at the remote location to persons present i n
the courtroom.
(9) Whether the person appearing by videoconferencing
technology presents a significant security risk t o
transport and be present physically in the courtroom.
(10) Whether the parties or witness(es) have waived
personal appearance or stipulated to videoconferencing.
(11) The proximity of the videoconferencing reques t
date to the proposed appearance date.
(12) Any other factors that the court may determine t o
be relevant.” MCR 2.407(C).
D. Request for Videoconferencing and Participant Contact
Information
A participant who requests videoconferencing is subject to th e
following requirements:
“(1) A participant who requests the use o f
videoconferencing technology shall ensure that th e
equipment available at the remote location meets th e
technical and operational standards established by th e
State Court Administrative Office.
(2) A participant who will be using videoconferencing
technology must provide the court with th e
participant’s contact information, including mobil e
phone number(s) and email address(es), in advance o f
the court date when videoconferencing technology wil l
be used. A court may collect the contact informatio n
using an SCAO-approved form. The contac t
information form used under this provision shall b e
confidential. An email address for an attorney must b e

Section 2.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2.1 Jurisdiction in General
The court must have jurisdiction with regard to both the parties and th e
subject matter. Sovereign v Sovereign, 354 Mich 65, 71 (1958). “[O]nce a
court acquires jurisdiction, unless the matter is properly removed o r
dismissed, that court is charged with the duty to render a final decisio n
on the merits of the case, resolving the dispute, with the entry of a n
enforceable judgment.” Clohset v No Name Corp (On Remand), 302 Mic h
App 550, 562 (2013).
“Courts are bound to take notice of the limits of their authority, and a
court may, and should, on its own motion, though the question is no t
raised by the pleadings or by counsel, recognize its lack of jurisdictio n
and act accordingly by staying proceedings, dismissing the action, o r
otherwise disposing thereof, at any stage of the proceeding.” In re Fraser
Estate, 288 Mich 392, 394 (1939). See also Hodge v State Farm Mut Auto Ins
Co, 499 Mich 211, 228 (2016).
Courts with jurisdiction may decline to exercise it based on forum no n
conveniens, which is “the ‘discretionary power of court to declin e
jurisdiction when convenience of parties and ends of justice would b e
better served if action were brought and tried in another forum.’ ”
Radeljak v DaimlerChrysler Corp, 475 Mich 598, 604 (2006), quoting Black’s
Law Dictionary (6th ed).
2.2 Subject-Matter Jurisdiction in General
“Subject-matter jurisdiction refers to a court’s power to act and authorit y
to hear and determine a case.” Usitalo v Landon, 299 Mich App 222, 22 8
(2012). Every court is required to confirm that subject-matter jurisdictio n
exists, either upon challenge or sua sponte. Clohset v No Name Corp (On
Remand), 302 Mich App 550, 560 (2013). “’Jurisdiction of the subjec t
matter is the right of the court to exercise judicial power over a class o f
cases, not the particular case before it; to exercise the abstract power t o
try a case of the kind or character of the one pending.’” Wayne Co v
AFSCME Local 3317, 325 Mich App 614, (2018), quoting Altman v Nelson,
197 Mich App 467, 472-473 (1992). “[A] judgment entered by a court tha t
lacks subject-matter jurisdiction is void[.]” Clohset, 302 Mich App at 561.
Parties may not waive defects in subject matter jurisdiction. Travelers Ins
Co v Detroit Edison Co, 465 Mich 185, 204 (2001). Accordingly, lack o f
subject matter jurisdiction is not waived by failure to raise it in th e
pleadings. MCR 2.111(F)(2). Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any time. MCR 2.116(D)(3). See also In re Brody Living Trust, 32 1
Mich App 304, 309 (2017) (holding that “subject-matter jurisdictio n
cannot be waived and can be raised at any time by any party or th e
court”) (citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted), vacated i n
Page 2-2 Michigan Judicial Institute

part on other grounds, 501 Mich 1094, 1094 (2018). “Although partie s
have no time constraints when challenging subject-matter jurisdiction,
procedurally a nonparty wishing to do so must first be a party to th e
action in the action’s normal course.” Kuhlgert v Mich State Univ, 328 Mic h
App 357, 380 (2019).
“The existence of subject-matter jurisdiction does not depend on th e
correctness of the trial court’s ultimate legal conclusions.” Usitalo, 29 9
Mich App at 228. “Thus, while the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction may
be collaterally attacked, a court’s exercise of jurisdiction can only b e
challenged on direct appeal.” Id. at 229.
A. Transfer
“Except as otherwise provided in [MCR 2.227],” a court lacking
subject matter jurisdiction may transfer the case to another Michiga n
court with proper jurisdiction. MCR 2.227(A). See also MCR 4.002
(transfer of actions from district court to circuit court). If the partie s
did not raise the jurisdictional issue, the court may not transfer th e
case “until the parties are given notice and an opportunity to be heard
on the jurisdictional issue.” MCR 2.227(A).
“A circuit court may not transfer an action to district court unde r
[MCR 2.227] based on the amount in controversy unless:
(a) the parties stipulate in good faith to the transfer an d
to an amount in controversy not greater than th e
applicable jurisdictional limit of the district court; or
(b) from the allegations of the complaint, it appears to a
legal certainty that the amount in controversy is no t
greater than the applicable jurisdictional limit of th e
district court.” MCR 2.227(B)(1).
1. Order Transferring Jurisdiction, Case Records, and
Required Fees
“The transferring court must enter all necessary order s
pertaining to the certification and transfer of the action to the
receiving court” and “order the plaintiff to pay the applicable
statutory filing fee directly to the receiving court, unless fee s
2
have been waived in accordance with MCR 2.002.” MCR
1For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
2“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002], courts must enable a litigant who seeks a fee
waiver to do so by an entirely electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L). See Section 1.11 for more information on
waiver of fees.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-3
=== Page 84 ===
Section 2.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2.227(C)(1). “The [transferring] court may also order the plaintif f
to pay reasonable compensation and attorney fees to the
defendant for filing the case in the wrong court.” Id.
“The transferring court must serve the order [of transfer] on the
parties and send a copy to the receiving court. The clerk of the
court must prepare the case records for transfer in accordance
with the orders entered under [MCR 2.227(C)(1)] and th e
Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards and send
them to the receiving court by a secure method.” MCR
2.227(C)(2). “If part of the action remains pending in th e
transferring court, certified copies of the papers filed may be
forwarded, with the cost to be paid by the plaintiff.” MCR
2.227(E)(1). “The receiving court shall temporarily suspen d
payment of the filing fee and open a case pending payment of
the filing fee and costs as ordered by the transferring court. The
receiving court must notify the plaintiff of the new case number
in the receiving court, the amount due, and the due date.” MCR
2.227(C)(3).
Jury trial waivers entered in the original court are not effective
after transfer; however, jury trial demands are preserved. MCR
2.227(E)(3). “A party who had waived trial by jury may deman d
a jury trial after transfer by filing a demand and paying the
applicable jury fee within 28 days after the filing fee is paid
under [MCR 2.227(D)(1)].” MCR 2.227(E)(3). If a jury fee wa s
paid prior to transfer, “the clerk of the transferring court mus t
forward it to the clerk of the receiving court as soon as possible
after the case records have been transferred.” MCR 2.227(D)(2).
2. Proceedings After Transfer
Once a case is transferred to a court of proper jurisdiction, the
case proceeds “‘as if it had been originally filed there.’” Ashle y
Ann Arbor, LLC v Pittsfield Charter Twp, 299 Mich App 138, 15 7
3
(2012), quoting MCR 2.227(E)(1). The receiving court mus t
dismiss the action if the plaintiff fails to pay the filing fee or fail s
to submit proof of the payment of any expenses ordered by the
transferring court within 28 days of the date of the transfer
order. MCR 2.227(D)(1).
The time for filing any further pleadings runs from the date the
filing fee is paid under MCR 2.227(D)(1). MCR 2.227(E)(1). Th e
receiving court must issue a new summons to the plaintiff if a
defendant was not served with process when the action was
transferred. MCR 2.227(E)(2).
3Formerly MCR 2.227(B)(1).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.2
B. Internal Affairs of Foreign Corporations Doctrine
The internal affairs of foreign corporations doctrine “is the rule tha t
the courts of one State will not exercise the power of decidin g
controversies relating merely to internal management of the affairs o f
a corporation organized under the laws of another State or o f
determining rights dependent upon such management, but will leav e
questions relating to the management of the internal affairs of a
foreign corporation to be settled by the tribunals of the State whic h
created the corporation.” Wojtczak v American United Life Ins Co, 29 3
Mich 449, 452 (1940) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
However, “circuit courts in Michigan have broad subject-matte r
jurisdiction over claims involving corporations,” MCL 600.3605, and
“Wojtczak should not be read as negating the subject-matter
jurisdiction the trial court otherwise holds under MCL 600.605. ”
Daystar Seller Fin, LLC v Hundley, 326 Mich App 31, 37 (2018). Rather,
“Wojtczak simply recognizes that the choice-of-law consideration s
implicated by the internal affairs doctrine should guide a trial court’ s
discretion in determining whether it ought to decline jurisdiction ove r
certain actions involving foreign corporations that would be mor e
appropriately adjudicated in another forum.” Id. at 37-38 (“the trial
court erred as a matter of law in dismissing [the] case for want o f
subject-matter jurisdiction” because “the claims [of the] case [did] no t
require the trial court to become involved in the management of th e
internal affairs of a foreign business entity”).
C. Ecclesiastical Abstention Doctrine
“The ecclesiastical abstention doctrine arises from the Religio n
Clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and
reflects [the Michigan Supreme] Court’s longstanding recognition tha t
it would be inconsistent with complete and untrammeled religiou s
liberty for civil courts to enter into a consideration of church doctrin e
or church discipline, to inquire into the regularity of the proceeding s
of church tribunals having cognizance of such matters, or t o
determine whether a resolution was passed in accordance with th e
canon law of the church, except insofar as it may be necessary to d o
so, in determining whether or not it was the church that acted
therein.” Winkler v Marist Fathers of Detroit, Inc, 500 Mich 327, 337-33 8
(2017) (quotation marks and citations omitted).
The ecclesiastical abstention doctrine “requires a case-specific inquir y
that informs how a court must adjudicate certain claims within it s
subject matter jurisdiction; it does not determine whether the cour t
has such jurisdiction in the first place.” Winkler, 500 Mich at 327. “Th e
existence of subject matter jurisdiction turns not on the particula r
facts of the matter before the court, but on its general legal
classification.” Id. “What matters . . . is whether the actual
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-5
=== Page 86 ===
Section 2.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
adjudication of a particular legal claim would require the resolutio n
of ecclesiastical questions; if so, the court must abstain from resolvin g
those questions itself, defer to the religious entity’s resolution of suc h
questions, and adjudicate the claim accordingly.” Id. at 341-342
(holding that “[i]t is for the circuit court, in the first instance, t o
determine whether and to what extent the adjudication of the legal
and factual issues presented by the plaintiff’s claim would require th e
resolution of ecclesiastical questions”).
D. Standard of Review
Whether a court has subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of la w
that is reviewed de novo. Mich Ass’n of Home Builders v City of Troy, 497
Mich 281, 285 (2015).
2.3 District Court Subject-Matter Jurisdiction
The district court has the following jurisdiction:
• Civil claims of $25,000 or less. MCL 600.8301(1).
• “[I]n its subject-matter jurisdiction inquiry, a distric t
court determines the amount in controversy using th e
prayer for relief set forth in the plaintiff’s pleadings ,
calculated exclusive of fees, costs, and interest.” Hodge v
State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 499 Mich 211, 223-224 (2016).
In the absence of bad faith in the pleadings, even if a
plaintiff’s proofs exceed the $25,000 jurisdictional limi t
of the district court under MCL 600.8301(1), “the prayer
for relief controls when determining the amount i n
controversy, and the limit of awardable damages. ”
Hodge, 499 Mich at 221, 224 (concluding that “i n
adopting MCL 600.8301, the Legislature intended t o
continue the longstanding practice of determining th e
jurisdictional amount based on the amount prayed for i n
the complaint”; thus, where a district court plaintif f
pleads a case of damages for $25,000 or less and obtain s
a verdict for more than that amount, he or she is limite d
to the jurisdictional amount ($25,000)).
• “A joint stipulation in good faith to an amount i n
controversy that has been approved by the cour t
necessarily governs a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction ,
as any pleading that contradicts such a joint stipulatio n
is unjustifiable and cannot be proved.” Krolczyk v
Hyundai Motor America, 507 Mich 966, 966 n 2 (2021)

order to provide that court with subject-matte r
jurisdiction where it otherwise would not posses s
subject-matter jurisdiction over that action”). In Krolczyk,
507 Mich at 966, the parties initially filed a complaint i n
circuit court stating that the amount in controvers y
exceeded $25,000. “After defendants rejected a cas e
evaluation award of $14,000 to plaintiffs, the parties file d
a stipulation in the circuit court that the amount i n
controversy was less than $25,000 and requested that th e
case be transferred to the district court pursuant to MCR
2.227.” Krolczyk, 507 Mich at 966. “The failure of th e
parties to explicitly stipulate to an appropriat e
amendment of the complaint when they requested tha t
the circuit court transfer the case to the district court, a s
required by Administrative Order No. 1998-1, . . . did
not deprive the district court of subject-matte r
jurisdiction over the action.” Krolczyk, 507 Mich at 966
(“[a]ssuming that the circuit court should not hav e
transferred the case pursuant to AO 1998-1 without a n
express stipulation to an appropriate amendment of th e
complaint, any error in granting the transfer withou t
such a stipulation was a procedural error tha t
defendants waived by failing to challenge the transfe r
within a reasonable time after it occurred”) (emphasi s
added).
• Generally, under the American rule, “each party bears its
own litigation expenses, including that party’s ow n
attorney fees, and therefore, [those] expenses are usuall y
not part of the matter at controversy between th e
parties.” ABCS Troy, LLC v Loancraft, LLC, 337 Mich App
125, 132 (2021). However, “the American rule is not a n
absolute one and . . . parties can contract around it[.]” Id.
“When parties do this, a claim of attorney fees under a
contractual fee-shifting provision is one for genera l
damages,” and “general damages count toward th e
amount in controversy.” Id. at 132-133, 139-141 (notin g
that although a party cannot know for certain th e
amount of attorney fees at the beginning of a lawsuit ,
when “a party makes a claim for attorney fees under [ a
contractual] provision, then that party can submit a
reasonable estimate of such fees that it expects to incu r
during the lawsuit for purposes of determining th e
amount in controversy”; additionally, “a defendant ca n
bring a counterclaim . . . seeking relief in an amoun t
beyond the district court’s jurisdictional limit”). See
Section 8.6(F) for additional information on an award of
contractual attorney fees.

infractions alleged to have been committed by juveniles

A. Concurrent Jurisdiction
Some district courts are under concurrent jurisdiction plans pursuan t
10
to MCL 600.401. However, there are some limitations on a distric t
court’s jurisdiction under a concurrent jurisdiction plan:
“(a) The circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction ove r
appeals from the district court and from administrativ e
agencies as authorized by statute.
(b) The circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction an d
power to issue, hear, and determine prerogative an d
remedial writs consistent with section 13 of article VI o f
the state constitution of 1963.” MCL 600.8304.
Under a concurrent jurisdiction plan, any magistrate in any of th e
district courts involved in the concurrent jurisdiction plan approved
by the Michigan Supreme Court is authorized to use any power s
granted to them by their judge under the local administrative orde r
(LAO), which must outline the duties that the district cour t
magistrate is authorized to perform pursuant to statute. See MCL
600.401, MCL 600.8304, MCL 600.8501, Administrative Order No.

B. Removal to Circuit Court
MCR 4.002 covers the transfer of an action from district court to
circuit court.
1. Counterclaim or Cross-Claim in Excess of Jurisdiction
“If a defendant asserts a counterclaim or cross-claim seeking
relief of an amount or nature beyond the jurisdiction or power of
the district court in which the action is pending, and
accompanies the notice of the claim with a statement verified i n
the manner prescribed by MCR 1.109(D)(3) indicating that th e
defendant is justly entitled to the relief demanded, the clerk shall
10See Section 2.6 on concurrent jurisdiction.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-11
=== Page 92 ===
Section 2.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
record the pleadings and present them to the judge to whom the
action is assigned.” MCR 4.002(A)(1). “The judge shall either
order the action transferred to the circuit court to which appeal
of the action would ordinarily lie or inform the defendant tha t
transfer will not be ordered without a motion and notice to the
11
other parties.” Id.
2. Change of Condition, Circumstance, or Unknown Facts
Requiring Relief in Excess of Jurisdiction
“A party may, at any time, file a motion with the district court i n
which an action is pending, requesting that the action be
transferred to circuit court. The motion must be supported by a
statement verified in the manner prescribed by MCR 1.109(D)(3)
indicating that
(a) due to a change in condition or circumstance, or
(b) due to facts not known by the party at the time
the action was commenced, the party wishes t o
seek relief of an amount or nature that is beyond
the jurisdiction or power of the court to grant.”
MCR 4.002(B)(1).
“If the district court finds that the party filing the motion may be
entitled to the relief the party now seeks to claim and that the
delay in making the claim is excusable, the court shall order the
action transferred to the circuit court to which an appeal of the
action would ordinarily lie.” MCR 4.002(B)(2).
3. Order for Transfer, Case Records, and Required Fees
“The district court must enter all necessary orders pertaining t o
the certification and transfer of the action to the circuit court”
and “order the moving party to pay the applicable statutory
filing fee directly to the circuit court, unless fees have bee n
12
waived in accordance with MCR 2.002.” MCR 4.002(C)(1). Th e
order must be entered on a SCAO-approved form. MCR
2.226(A). If the order “is not prepared as required under [MCR
2.226(A)], and the order lacks the information necessary for the
receiving court to determine under which rule the transfer wa s
ordered, the clerk of the receiving court shall refuse to accept the
11MCR 4.002(C), MCR 4.002(D), MCR 4.201(H)(2), and MCR 4.202(I)(4) govern transfer of summary
proceedings to recover possession of premises. MCR 4.002(A)(2).
12“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002], courts must enable a litigant who seeks a fee
waiver to do so by an entirely electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L). See Section 1.11 for more information on
waiver of fees.

transfer and shall prepare a notice of refusal on a form approved
by the [SCAO] and return the case to the transferring court for a
proper order within seven business days of receipt of the
transfer order.” MCR 2.226(B). Upon receipt of a refusal to accep t
a transfered case under MCR 2.226(B), the transferring cour t
must “prepare a proper order in accordance with [MCR
2.226(A)] and retransfer the case within seven business days. ”
MCR 2.226(C). “The district court may also order the part y
seeking transfer to pay the opposing parties the costs they have
reasonably incurred up to that time that would not have bee n
incurred if the action had originally been brought in circui t
court.” MCR 4.002(C)(2).
“The district court must serve the order [of transfer] on the
parties and send a copy to the circuit court. The clerk of the
district court must prepare the case records for transfer i n
accordance with the orders entered under [MCR 4.002(C)(1)] and
the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards and
send them to the receiving court by a secure method.” MCR
4.002(C)(3). “The circuit court shall temporarily suspend
payment of the filing fee and open a case pending payment of
the filing fee and costs as ordered by the district court. Th e
circuit court must notify the moving party of the new cas e
number in the circuit court, the amount due, and the due date.”
MCR 4.002(C)(4).
Any jury fee paid in the district court will transfer to the circui t
court, and the party requesting the jury must pay the circui t
court any difference in the jury fee “within 28 days after th e
filing fee is paid under [MCR 4.002(D)(1)].” MCR 4.002(D)(2).
4. Proceedings After Transfer
“After transfer, no further proceedings may be conducted in the
district court, and the action shall proceed in the circuit court.
The circuit court may order further pleadings and set the time
when they must be filed.” MCR 4.002(C)(5).
“No further action may be had in the case [in circuit court] until
payment [of the applicable filing fee] is made.” MCR 4.002(D)(1).
The circuit court must dismiss the counterclaim or cross-claimor
enter an order transferring the case back to the district court if
the filing fee or costs ordered by the district court are not paid
within 28 days of the date of the transfer order. Id.; MCR
4.002(D)(3).

leave to appeal is granted. MCR 7.107.
“Appeals from the district court shall be on a written transcript of th e
record made in the district court or on a record settled and agreed t o
by the parties and approved by the court.” MCL 600.8341. “Appeal s
from the district court shall be to the circuit court in the county i n
which the judgment is rendered.” MCL 600.8342(1). Appeals fro m
final judgments are generally appeals as of right and other appeal s
are by application; however, all appeals from final orders an d
judgments based upon pleas of guilty or nolo contendere are b y
application. MCL 600.8342(2); MCL 600.8342(4). “All appeals to the
court of appeals from judgments entered by the circuit court or th e
recorder’s court on appeals from the district court shall be b y
application.” MCL 600.8342(3).
2.4 Circuit Court Subject-Matter Jurisdiction
The circuit court is the court of general jurisdiction. Const 1963, art 6, §
13; MCL 600.605. It has jurisdiction over all matters not assigned to other
courts, except as otherwise provided by the Legislature. Const 1963, art 6,
§ 13; MCL 600.605. See also Schaaf v Forbes (On Remand), 338 Mich App 1 ,
12 (2021) (“jurisdiction extends to all civil claims and remedies, excep t
where exclusive jurisdiction is given in the constitution or by statute t o
some other court or where the circuit courts are denied jurisdiction by th e
constitution or statutes of this state”) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted); In re Petition of Tuscola Co Treasurer for Foreclosure, 317 Mich App
688, 695 (2016) (“circuit courts are presumed to have subject-matte r
jurisdiction unless jurisdiction is expressly prohibited or given to anothe r
court by constitution or statute”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
In 1996, the Legislature created the Family Division of Circuit Court b y
transferring many cases previously handled by the probate court to th e
circuit courts and by requiring circuit courts and probate courts t o
develop a plan for the family division. MCL 600.1011; MCL 600.1021. The
legislation anticipated that some probate judges would serve in th e
family division. MCL 600.1011(6).

joined in a divorce action only if they are alleged t o
have conspired with one spouse to defraud the other
spouse.” Souden, 303 Mich App at 410. “Specifically, a
divorce court lacks the jurisdiction to adjudicate the
rights of third-party creditors.” Id. However, “ a
divorce court [has] power to enforce charging lien s

foreclosure. Southfield v Shefa, LLC, 340 Mich App 391, 40 7
(2022), citing MCL 554.1016; MCL 600.2926; MCL 600.2927;
MCL 600.2940; MCL 125.542; MCL 600.3101; MCL 600.601;
MCL 600.605.
A. Removal to District Court
MCR 2.227 covers transfer of actions upon a finding of lack o f
jurisdiction. See Section 2.2(A) for a discussion of MCR 2.227.
“A circuit court may not transfer an action to district court unde r
[MCR 2.227] based on the amount in controversy unless:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-17
=== Page 98 ===
Section 2.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(a) the parties stipulate in good faith to the transfer an d
to an amount in controversy not greater than th e
applicable jurisdictional limit of the district court; or
(b) from the allegations of the complaint, it appears to a
legal certainty that the amount in controversy is no t
greater than the applicable jurisdictional limit of th e
district court.” MCR 2.227(B)(1).
An order for transfer of jurisdiction must be entered on a SCAO-
approved form. MCR 2.226(A). If the order “is not prepared a s
required under [MCR 2.226(A)], and the order lacks the information
necessary for the receiving court to determine under which rule th e
transfer was ordered, the clerk of the receiving court shall refuse t o
accept the transfer and shall prepare a notice of refusal on a for m
approved by the [SCAO] and return the case to the transferring cour t
for a proper order within seven business days of receipt of th e
transfer order.” MCR 2.226(B). Upon receipt of a refusal to accept a
transfered case under MCR 2.226(B), the transferring court mus t
“prepare a proper order in accordance with [MCR 2.226(A)] an d
retransfer the case within seven business days.” MCR 2.226(C).
B. Aggregating Claims
In an action that is not a class action, multiple plaintiffs canno t
aggregate their claims to establish the jurisdictional limit for circui t
court. Boyd v Nelson Credit Ctrs, Inc, 132 Mich App 774, 780-781 (1984 )
(distinguishing Crippen v Fletcher, 56 Mich 386 (1885) and Henderson v
Detroit & Mackinac R Co, 131 Mich 438 (1902) because those case s
permitted a single plaintiff to aggregate claims and did not addres s
the aggregation of multiple plaintiffs’ claims). See also Mich Head &
Spine Institute PC v Auto-Owners Ins Co, 338 Mich App 721, 727 (2021 )
(holding that “based on treatment it provided to 39 separat e
patients,” plaintiff was “indisputably a single plaintiff attempting t o
aggregate its various claims,” and “applying the rule from Boyd, ”
plaintiff could “aggregate its various claims for the purposes o f
determining jurisdiction”); Moody v Home Owners Ins Co, 304 Mic h
App 415, 443 (2014) (holding that under the specific facts of the case,
there was “such an identity between the providers’ and [th e
plaintiff’s] claims that consolidation for trial resulted in merging th e
claims” to determine the amount in controversy; further, “th e
providers’ claims [were] derivative of [the plaintiff’s] claims,” thus,
the rule allowing a single plaintiff to aggregate claims to determin e
subject-matter jurisdiction applied), rev’d on other grounds by Hodge
19
v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 499 Mich 211 (2016).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.4
While MCR 2.206(A) permits the joinder of parties, it is unclea r
whether that rule can be used to establish jurisdiction which would
not otherwise exist.
C. Business Courts
“A business court has jurisdiction over business and commercial
disputes in which equitable or declaratory relief is sought or in whic h
the matter otherwise meets circuit court jurisdictional requirements. ”
MCL 600.8035(1).
“Business and commercial disputes include, but are not limited to, th e
following types of actions:
(a) Those involving the sale, merger, purchase,
combination, dissolution, liquidation, organizationa l
structure, governance, or finances of a busines s
enterprise.
(b) Those involving information technology, software,
or website development, maintenance, or hosting.
(c) Those involving the internal organization or busines s
entities and the rights or obligations of shareholders,
partners, members, officers, directors, or managers.
(d) Those arising out of contractual agreements or othe r
business dealings, including licensing, trade secret,
intellectual property, antitrust, securities, noncompete,
nonsolicitation, and confidentiality agreements if al l
available administrative remedies are completel y
exhausted, including, but not limited to, alternativ e
dispute resolution processes prescribed in th e
agreements.
(e) Those arising out of commercial transactions,
including commercial bank transactions.
(f) Those arising out of business or commercial
insurance policies.
(g) Those involving commercial real property.” MCL
600.8031(2).
See MCL 600.8031(3) for a list of actions that are specifically not
business or commercial disputes.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-19
=== Page 100 ===
Section 2.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
1. Initial Assignment to Business Court
“An action must be assigned to a business court if all or part o f
the action includes a business or commercial dispute. An action
that involves a business or commercial dispute that is filed in a
court with a business docket must be maintained in a busines s
court although it also involves claims that are not business or
commercial disputes, including excluded claims under [MCL
600.8031(3)].” MCL 600.8035(3).
2. Removal to Business Court
“An action that does not initially include a business or
commercial dispute but that subsequently includes a business o r
commercial dispute as a result of a cross-claim, counterclaim,
third-party complaint, amendment, or any other modification of
the action must be reassigned by blind draw to a business court
after the action is modified to include a business or commercial
dispute as prescribed by the plan submitted under [MCL
600.8033(1) or MCL 600.8033(2)], as applicable.” MCL
600.8035(6).
3. Reassignment from Business Court
“An action assigned to a business court judge may be reassigned
by blind draw to another judge as prescribed by the pla n
submitted under [MCL 600.8033(1) or MCL 600.8033(2)], as
applicable, if the action ceases to include a business or
commercial dispute.” MCL 600.8035(5).
4. Venue, Fees, and Appeals
“Venue of a suit in the business court is as provided in [MCL
20
600.1601 et seq.].” MCL 600.8035(2). “The fees payable in civil
actions in circuit court apply to cases in a business court, unles s
otherwise provided by law.” MCL 600.8045. An appeal from a
business court is to the Court of Appeals and is governed by
[MCR 7.200 et seq.]. MCL 600.8041. However, “[a]n order
concerning the assignment of a case to the business court under
[MCL 600.8001 et seq.] is not appealable to the court of appeals. ”
MCL 600.308(3).

D. Jurisdiction Pending Appeal
“[T]he filing of a claim of appeal typically divests the circui t
court of its jurisdiction to amend its final orders and judgments.”
Cary Investments, LLC v Mount Pleasant, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2022) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In Cary,
“[b]ecause plaintiff’s motion requested permission to file a n
amended complaint after the trial court had dismissed the
original complaint, the motion asked the circuit court to alter th e
order plaintiff had already appealed. Thus, the trial court lacked
jurisdiction to address plaintiff’s motion to amend its complain t
during the pendency of [the] appeal.” Id. at ___.
2.5 Probate Court Subject-Matter Jurisdiction
The probate court has the jurisdiction, powers, and duties as provided b y
law. Const 1963, art 6, § 15. See also Manning v Amerman, 229 Mich App
608, 611 (1998) (“[t]he probate court . . . is a court of limited jurisdiction ,
deriving all of its power from statutes”). There must be a probate court i n
each county organized for judicial purposes. Const 1963, art 6, § 15.
Probate courts have jurisdiction as conferred by:
• the Estates and Protected Individuals Code (EPIC);
• the Mental Health Code;
• the Revised Judicature Act; and
• any other law or compact. MCL 600.841(1).
The probate court “has exclusive legal and equitable jurisdiction of all of
the following:
(a) A matter that relates to the settlement of a deceased
individual’s estate, whether testate or intestate, who was a t
the time of death domiciled in the county or was at the time
of death domiciled out of state leaving an estate within the
county to be administered, including, but not limited to, all
of the following proceedings:
(i) The internal affairs of the estate.
(ii) Estate administration, settlement, and distribution.
(iii) Declaration of rights that involve an estate, devisee,
heir, or fiduciary.
(iv) Construction of a will.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-21
=== Page 102 ===
Section 2.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(v) Determination of heirs.
(vi) Determination of death of an accident or disaster
victim under [MCL 700.1208].
(b) A proceeding that concerns the validity, internal affairs, or
settlement of a trust; the administration, distribution,
modification, reformation, or termination of a trust; or the
declaration of rights that involve a trust, trustee, or trus t
beneficiary, including, but not limited to, proceedings to d o
all of the following:
(i) Appoint or remove a trustee.
(ii) Review the fees of a trustee.
(iii) Require, hear, and settle interim or final accounts.
(iv) Ascertain beneficiaries.
(v) Determine a question that arises in th e
administration or distribution of a trust, including a
question of construction of a will or trust.
(vi) Instruct a trustee and determine relative to a trustee
the existence or nonexistence of an immunity, power,
privilege, duty, or right.
(vii) Release registration of a trust.
(viii) Determine an action or proceeding that involves
settlement of an irrevocable trust.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in . . . MCL 600.1021, a
proceeding that concerns a guardianship, conservatorship, or
protective proceeding.
(d) A proceeding to require, hear, or settle the accounts of a
fiduciary and to order, upon request of an interested person,
instructions or directions to a fiduciary that concern an estate
within the court’s jurisdiction.” MCL 700.1302.
“[B]y having set forth and retaining specific statutory authorization fo r
the circuit court to hear and decide matters concerning rights to real
property [(MCL 600.2932(1); MCL 600.3301)], the Legislature provided
that its grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the probate court over th e
administration and distribution of trusts [does] not extend to . . . real
property claims.” Schaaf v Forbes (On Remand), 338 Mich App 1, 13 (2021).
“The Legislature declined to grant the probate court exclusiv e
jurisdiction over every cause of action that might incidentally touch o n
such issues as a settlor’s intentions but, instead, confined that grant of
exclusive jurisdiction to a proceeding that concerns the distribution of a
Page 2-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 103 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.5
trust; or the declaration of rights that involve a trust, trustee, or trus t
beneficiary.” Id. at 14 (cleaned up). “The statutory reference to ‘ a
proceeding’ that ‘concerns’ trust matters suggests that the exclusiv e
jurisdiction of the probate court under MCL 700.1302(b)(vi) covers no t
every issue that might arise from involvement of a trust, but rather t o
whole causes of action fundamentally arising from issues concerning th e
distribution of trusts or the rights and duties of affected persons.” Schaaf,
338 Mich App at 14.
Although a petition filed under the EPIC for the removal of a truste e
involved “claims relating to two family businesses,” the trust action wa s
not “within the mandatory jurisdiction of the business court under MCL
21
600.8035.” In re Brody Living Trust, 321 Mich App 304, 309 (2017),
22
vacated in part on other grounds, 501 Mich 1094, 1094 (2018). . “[T]he
probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over [the petitioner’s] claim s
under MCL 700.1302 and MCL 700.1303” because the “petition wa s
brought under the EPIC[.]” Brody I, 321 Mich App at 314.
Committee Tip:
If a matter is brought in circuit court where
exclusive jurisdiction rests in the probate court, it
may be possible to appoint the circuit judge as
an acting probate judge, or the matter may be
removed to probate court. See MCL 600.1021 for
the transfer of jurisdiction to the family division
of the circuit court, effective January 1, 1998.
A. Concurrent Jurisdiction
“In addition to the jurisdiction conferred by [MCL 700.1302] an d
other laws, the court has concurrent legal and equitable jurisdiction t o
21“Matters brought under the EPIC are specifically excluded from the definition of ‘business or commercial
dispute’ in MCL 600.8031(1)(c)[;]” “[t]o the extent the petition involved transactions of the . . . famil y
businesses or existing contracts, these matters arose only tangentially to the central issue of [the trustee’ s
alleged] breach of fiduciary duty[.]” In re Brody Living Trust, 321 Mich App 304, 311 (2017), vacated in part
on other grounds, 501 Mich 1094, 1094 (2018) (declining to interpret MCL 600.8035(3) “as requiring ever y
case affecting or affected by a business matter, including a trust case, to be brought before the busines s
court[;]” rather, MCL 600.8035(3) “indicate[s] a Legislative intent to retain cases originally filed in the
business court for the entirety of the proceedings, regardless of whether the business dispute als o
involves, or comes to involve, excluded subject matter”) (emphasis added). See Section 2.4(C) fo r
additional information on business or commercial disputes.

Some probate courts are under concurrent jurisdiction plans pursuan t
23
to MCL 600.401. MCL 600.841(2). However, there are limitations o n
a probate court’s jurisdiction under a concurrent jurisdiction plan:
“(a) The circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction ove r
appeals from the district court and from administrativ e
agencies as authorized by law.
(b) The circuit court has exclusive jurisdiction an d
power to issue, hear, and determine prerogative an d
remedial writs consistent with section 13 of article VI o f
the state constitution of 1963.” MCL 600.841(2).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.6
B. Removal to Probate Court
MCL 600.845 states that a circuit court with concurrent jurisdiction i s
not deprived of that jurisdiction when jurisdiction is granted to th e
probate court by MCL 600.801 et seq. Where concurrent jurisdictio n
exists between the probate court and another court, an action o r
proceeding may be removed from the other court to the probat e
court, “upon motion of a party and after a finding and order on th e
jurisdictional issue.” MCL 600.846. See also MCL 700.1303(2).
An order for transfer of jurisdiction must be entered on a SCAO-
approved form. MCR 2.226(A). If the order “is not prepared a s
required under [MCR 2.226(A)], and the order lacks the information
necessary for the receiving court to determine under which rule th e
transfer was ordered, the clerk of the receiving court shall refuse t o
accept the transfer and shall prepare a notice of refusal on a for m
approved by the [SCAO] and return the case to the transferring cour t
for a proper order within seven business days of receipt of th e
transfer order.” MCR 2.226(B). Upon receipt of a refusal to accept a
transfered case under MCR 2.226(B), the transferring court mus t
“prepare a proper order in accordance with [MCR 2.226(A)] an d
retransfer the case within seven business days.” MCR 2.226(C).
C. Appeals from Probate Court
Final judgments and orders issued by the probate court are generall y
appealable to the Court of Appeals as of right. MCL 600.308(1). Se e
also Administrative Order No. 2016-4, 500 Mich cxlii (2016 )
(providing for expedited consideration of probate appeals pending i n
circuit court and requiring reporting of pending probate appeals i n
the circuit court in light of 2016 PA 186, which repealed MCL 600.863,
which provided that probate appeals be made in the circuit court).
Other judgments or interlocutory orders from the probate court a s
determined by the Michigan Court Rules are appealable to the Court
of Appeals only by leave granted. MCL 600.308(2)(c).

MCL 600.413(2). The objection must specifically state the reasons for th e
objection and may include objections based on insufficient allocation o f
staff or resources, inadequate training for any judge or staff, excessiv e
assignments outside of a judge’s election district, or retaliation for an y
action, including failing to vote for a concurrent jurisdiction plan. Id.
“Subject to approval of the supreme court, before the supreme cour t
approves a concurrent jurisdiction plan under [MCL 600.401 et seq.], the
state court administrator shall review objections under [MCL 600.413]
and report the substance of the objections and the administrator’ s
findings about the objections’ validity to the supreme court. Subject t o
approval of the supreme court, the state court administrator shall
forward a proposed concurrent jurisdiction plan to the supreme court fo r
review after affirmatively finding that the proposed concurren t
jurisdiction plan is in compliance with [MCL 600.401 et seq.] and the bes t
interests of the people in the communities being served.” MCL
600.413(3).
“Within each judicial circuit, subject to approval by the supreme cour t
and to the limitations contained in [MCL 600.410, MCL 600.841, and MCL
600.8304], a plan of concurrent jurisdiction shall be adopted by a majority
vote of all of the judges of the trial courts in the plan unless a majority o f
all of the judges of the trial courts in that judicial circuit vote not to have a
plan of concurrent jurisdiction. If a majority of all of the judges of the trial
courts in a judicial circuit vote not to have a plan of concurren t
jurisdiction, the chief judge of the circuit court of that judicial circuit shall
report the results of that vote to the state court administrator.” MCL
600.401(1).

B. Verified Claim and Notice
The state of Michigan “enjoys sovereign immunity and it determine s
when it can be sued, and under what conditions.” Stephens v Dep't of
Corrections, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “One of those conditions
that must be complied with before suing the state is the notic e
requirement contained in MCL 600.6431, which ‘sets forth a general
rule that a party must follow, regardless of forum, if that party is t o
overcome immunity and bring the state before a court.’” Stephens, __ _

of [the state of Michigan] designated in the claim or notice.” MCL
600.6431(3).
MCL 600.6431(3) “is an unambiguous condition precedent to sue the
state, and a claimant’s failure to comply strictly with this notic e
provision warrants dismissal of the claim, even if no prejudic e
resulted.” Stephens, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “There are no statutory exceptions to complianc e
with the notice provision, and no statutory time period for when th e
defense of lack of compliance can be raised.” Id. at ___.
“The failure to provide a verified claim or notice of intent is a bar t o
pursuing a claim in the Court of Claims.” Chisolm v State Police, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2023). In Chisolm, the Court of Appeals conclude d
that “plaintiff’s notice satisfied the requirement contained in [MCL
600.6431(2)(d)] of a verification ‘before an officer authorized t o
administer oaths,’ because plaintiff signed and swore to the notic e
before a notary public.” Chisolm, ___ Mich App at ___ (noting
plaintiff’s notice of intent “was signed by plaintiff and his attorney,
and was notarized”). “[R]egardless of whether plaintiff’s notice o f
intent is a document under the broad definition of ‘document’ i n
MCR 1.109(B), and thus subject to the subrule governing th e
verification of documents, plaintiff’s jurat notification satisfies MCR
1.109(D)(3)(a) as an ‘oath or affirmation of the party or of someon e
having knowledge of the facts stated.’” Chisolm, ___ Mich App at ___.
See Section 2.7(C) for additional information on the notic e
requirements of MCL 600.6431.
C. Notice Requirements
MCL 600.6431 “operates as a precondition to suing the state.” Stephens
v Dep't of Corrections, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted) (holding that “both caselaw and the court rule s
allow the state to invoke immunity-based defenses at any time durin g
litigation”). “MCL 600.6431(1) provides that a plaintiff cannot sue th e
state of Michigan without first filing a notice within one year after th e
date at which the claim accrued.” Hudson v Dep’t of Corrections, ___
Mich App ___, ___ (2025). Specifically, MCL 600.6431(1) states, in part,
that “a claim may not be maintained against [the state of Michigan ]
unless the claimant, within 1 year after the claim has accrued, files i n
the office of the clerk of the court of claims either a written claim or a
written notice of intention to file a claim against [Michigan] or any o f
its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, o r
agencies.” “The notice provision is an integral component an d
precondition to being able to sue the state, as this provisio n
‘establishes conditions precedent for avoiding the governmental
immunity conferred by the GTLA [governmental tort liability act ,
Page 2-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 111 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.7
MCL 691.1401 et seq.], which expressly incorporates MCL 600.6431.’”
Stephens, ___ Mich App at ___, quoting Fairley v Dep’t of Corrections,
497 Mich 290, 297 (2015).
“[A]ll parties with claims against the state, except those exempted i n
MCL 600.6431 itself, must comply with the notice requirements of
MCL 600.6431(1).” Christie v Wayne State Univ, ___ Mich ___, ___
(2023). “This includes claims against the state brought in the circui t
court.” Id. at ___ (noting that MCL 600.6431(1)’s notice requirements
apply categorically to “a claim” against the state, including those filed
in the circuit court, except as otherwise excepted in the statute). Pu t
differently, “any claim against the state, regardless of where it is filed,
must comply with MCL 600.6431(1)’s notice requirements, except fo r
claims brought under the [wrongful imprisonment compensation ac t
(WICA), MCL 691.1751 to 691.1757] as exempted in MCL
600.6431(5).” Christie, ___ Mich at ___. See also Elia Cos, LLC v Univ o f
Mich Regents, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2023) (holding that defects in
complaint cannot be cured after the 1 year notice requirement of MCL
29
600.6431 has expired).
“[T]he notice requirements of MCL 600.6431(1) apply to all claim s
against the state, including those filed in the circuit court . . . . ”
Flamont v Dep’t of Corrections, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotatio n
marks omitted) (holding that Christie has “full retroactive effect ”
because it did not establish a new rule of law); see also Hudson, __ _
Mich App at ___ (conflict panel opinion holding that Christie applie s
retroactively to all pending cases). In Flamont, the plaintiff did not file
the Court of Claims notice described in MCL 600.6431(A). Flamont,
___ Mich App at ___. The Court of Appeals agreed with defendants ’
assertion that “plaintiff’s failure to comply with the requirements o f
MCL 600.6431 was fatal to her claims because the statutorily required
notice was a condition precedent to overcoming governmental
immunity, even when the action was filed in the circuit court. ”
Flamont, ___ Mich App at ___.
While a plaintiff’s complaint is required to be verified under MCL
600.6434, a plaintiff is “not required to file both his verified notice of
intent and his verified complaint within the time period specified i n
MCL 600.6431.” Chisolm v State Police, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023 )
(holding that because plaintiff “complied with MCL 600.6431 by
timely filing his [verified] notice of intent, [he] was not required als o
to file his verified complaint within the time period established b y
MCL 600.6431”). Although “plaintiff’s original complaint was no t
verified and the amended complaint, though verified, was not file d
until after the time limit for complying with MCL 600.6431,” “the
29A claim against the state for property damage or personal injury must be filed within six months after the
event giving rise to the claim. MCL 600.6431(4).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-31
=== Page 112 ===
Section 2.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Court of Claims did not err by holding that plaintiff’s amended
complaint was not subject to dismissal under MCL 600.6431. ”
Chisolm, ___ Mich App at ___. The Court distinguished Elia Cos, LLC,
where “the plaintiff did not file a verified notice of intent[,]” “and
although the plaintiff filed a complaint within the time period[,] th e
complaint was not verified.” Chisolm, ___ Mich App at ___. I n
contrast, in Chisolm, “plaintiff fully complied with MCL 600.6431 b y
timely filing a verified notice of intent to file a claim. Having done so,
plaintiff’s complaint was not subject to the time requirements of MCL
600.6431.” Chisolm, ___ Mich App at ___.
D. Jury Trial Right and Joinder
MCL 600.6421 addresses trial by jury and the joinder and transfer of
claims.
“Nothing in [Chapter 64 of the Revised Judicature Act, MCL 600.6401
et seq.] eliminates or creates any right a party may have to a trial by
jury, including any right that existed before November 12,
2013, . . . [nor] deprives the circuit, district, or probate court o f
jurisdiction to hear and determine a claim for which there is a right t o
a trial by jury as otherwise provided by law, including a claim agains t
an individual employee of this state for which there is a right to a trial
by jury as otherwise provided by law. Except as otherwise provided
by this section, if a party has the right to a trial by jury and asserts tha t
right as required by law, the claim may be heard and determined by a
circuit, district, or probate court in the appropriate venue.” MCL
600.6421(1).
“For declaratory or equitable relief or a demand for extraordinar y
writ sought by a party within the jurisdiction of the court of claim s
described in [MCL 600.6419(1)] and arising out of the sam e
transaction or series of transactions with a matter asserted for which a
party has the right to a trial by jury under [MCL 600.6421(1)], unles s
joined as provided in [MCL 600.6421(3)], the court of claims shall
retain exclusive jurisdiction over the matter of declaratory o r
equitable relief or a demand for extraordinary writ until a fina l
judgment has been entered, and the matter asserted for which a part y
has the right to a trial by jury under [MCL 600.6421(1)] shall be stayed
until final judgment on the matter of declaratory or equitable relief o r
a demand for extraordinary writ.” MCL 600.6421(2).
“With the approval of all parties, any matter within the jurisdiction o f
the court of claims described in [MCL 600.6419(1)] may be joined for
trial with cases arising out of the same transaction or series o f
transactions that are pending in any of the various trial courts of th e
state. A case in the court of claims that has been joined with th e
approval of all parties shall be tried and determined by the judg e
Page 2-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 113 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.7
even though the trial court action with which it may be joined is tried
to a jury under the supervision of the same trial judge.” MCL
600.6421(3).
E. Transfer to the Court of Claims
“A notice of transfer to the Court of Claims must be provided befor e
or at the time the defendant files an answer.” MCR 2.228(A). If the
time to file an answer has passed, and “the court in which [the] civil
action is pending has concurrent jurisdiction with the Court o f
Claims, the defendant must seek leave to file a notice of transfer an d
the court may grant leave if it is satisfied that the facts on which th e
motion is based were not and could not with reasonable diligenc e
have been known to the moving party more than 14 days before th e
motion was filed.” MCR 2.228(B)(1). “If the court in which [the] civil
action is pending does not have subject matter jurisdiction becaus e
the case is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims,
MCR 2.227 governs.” MCR 2.228(B)(2). See Section 2.2(A) for mor e
information on transfers under MCR 2.227.
An order for transfer of jurisdiction must be entered on a SCAO-
approved form. MCR 2.226(A). If the order “is not prepared a s
required under [MCR 2.226(A)], and the order lacks the information
necessary for the receiving court to determine under which rule th e
transfer was ordered, the clerk of the receiving court shall refuse t o
accept the transfer and shall prepare a notice of refusal on a for m
approved by the [SCAO] and return the case to the transferring cour t
for a proper order within seven business days of receipt of th e
transfer order.” MCR 2.226(B). Upon receipt of a refusal to accept a
transfered case under MCR 2.226(B), the transferring court mus t
“prepare a proper order in accordance with [MCR 2.226(A)] an d
retransfer the case within seven business days.” MCR 2.226(C).
F. Remedy in Federal Court Exception
MCL 600.6440 provides:
“No claimant may be permitted to file claim in sai d
court against the state nor any department, commission,
board, institution, arm or agency thereof who has a n
adequate remedy upon his claim in the federal courts,
but it is not necessary in the complaint filed to alleg e
that claimant has no such adequate remedy, but that fac t
may be put in issue by the answer or motion filed by th e
state or the department, commission, board, institution,
arm or agency thereof.”
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-33
=== Page 114 ===
Section 2.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
G. Res Judicata
“The judgment entered by the court of claims upon any clai m
described in [MCL 600.6419(1)], either against or in favor of the state
or any of its departments or officers, upon becoming final is re s
judicata of that claim.” MCL 600.6419(2).
H. Setoff, Recoupment, or Cross Declaration
“Upon the trial of any cause in which any demand is made by the
state or any of its departments or officers against the claimant either
by way of setoff, recoupment, or cross declaration, the court shall hea r
and determine each claim or demand, and if the court finds a balanc e
due from the claimant to the state, the court shall render judgment i n
favor of the state for the balance.” MCL 600.6419(2).
I. Judgment
“Writs of execution or garnishment may issue upon the judgment th e
same as from the circuit court of this state.” MCL 600.6419(2). Th e
judgment entered by the court of claims upon any claim, either for o r
against the claimant, is final unless appealed from as provided i n
[MCL 600.6401 et seq.].” MCL 600.6419(2).
J. Caselaw
1. Jurisdiction Over Actions for Mandamus Against State
30
Officials and Departments
“MCL 600.6419, as amended by 2013 PA 164, properly delegate s
to the Court of Claims jurisdiction over actions for mandamu s
against state officials and departments”; although MCL
31
600.6419(1)(a) and MCL 600.4401(1) “clearly conflict,” they ca n
be harmonized by reading MCL 600.6419(1)(a) “to expand the
original jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to include ‘any
demand for an extraordinary writ against the state or any of it s
departments or officers,’ such that the Court of Claims now
possesses jurisdiction over mandamus claims that had
previously been within the jurisdiction of the circuit cour t
pursuant to MCL 600.4401(1).” O’Connell v Dir of Elections, 316
Mich App 91, 100, 103-104, 108 (2016) (holding that “the Court of
Claims erred by concluding that it lacked subject-matter
30See Section 9.9 for additional information on writs of mandamus.
31MCL 600.4401 states that “[a]n action for mandamus against a state officer shall be commenced in the
court of appeals, or in the circuit court in the county in which venue is proper or in Ingham county, at th e
option of the party commencing the action.”
Page 2-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 115 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.7
jurisdiction to hear and decide” the plaintiff judge’s mandamu s
action against the Director of Elections and other state-level
defendants). “[T]he circuit court never had exclusive jurisdictio n
over claims for mandamus against state-level defendants, MCL
600.6419(1) permissibly delegated such jurisdiction to the Cour t
[32]
of Claims, and MCL 600.6419(6) did not revoke tha t
delegation of jurisdiction because it was unnecessary to do so.”
O’Connell, 316 Mich App at 104, 106 (holding that the exceptio n
under MCL 600.6419(6) did not apply because the circuit cour t
shared concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Appeals and
therefore lacked exclusive jurisdiction over mandamus action s
involving state officers).
2. Jurisdiction Over Headlee Amendment Claims
The Court of Claims “has subject-matter jurisdiction over
Headlee Amendment claims.” Telford v State of Michigan, 327
Mich App 195, 197 (2019) (the Court of Claims erred when i t
transfered the plaintiffs’ Headlee Amendment claim to the
circuit court pursuant to City of Riverview v State of Michigan, 29 2
Mich App 516 (2011), which holds that a Headlee Amendmen t
action may be filed in circuit court pursuant to MCL 600.308a(1),
because “the Legislature intended to repeal MCL 600.308a(1) by
implication when it enacted 2013 PA 164,” expanding the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims).
3. Jurisdiction Over Appeals Regarding the Department
of Treasury’s Seizure of Tobacco Products
There is “an inherent tension between” MCL 600.6419(1)(a),
which provides the Court of Claims with exclusive jurisdictio n
for claims “against the state or any of its departments or officers
notwithstanding another law that confers jurisdiction of the case in the
circuit court” and MCL 205.429(4), which requires an “appeal t o
33
the circuit court of the county where the seizure was made[.]”
Prime Time Int’l Distrib, Inc v Dep’t of Treasury, 322 Mich App 46,
55 (2017) (emphasis added). “To remedy this tension, [the Court]
[34]
look[s] first to the exceptions under the CCA, MCL
600.6419(5), which provides: ‘[the CCA] does not deprive th e
circuit court of exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the
32MCL 600.6419(6) provides that Chapter 64 of the Revised Judicature Act “does not deprive the circuit
court of exclusive jurisdiction to issue, hear, and determine prerogative and remedial writs consistent wit h
section 13 of article VI of the state constitution of 1963.”
33MCL 205.429 provides the procedure for judicial review of the Michigan Department of Treasury’s
actions under the Tobacco Products Tax Act (TPTA), MCL 205.421 et seq.
34The Court of Claims Act, MCL 600.6401 et seq.

Section 2.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
district court and administrative agencies as authorized by
law.’” Prime Time Int’l Distrib, 322 Mich App at 55-56.
Accordingly, where MCL 600.6419(5) applies, the Court o f
Claims does not have jurisdiction to hear an action against the
state. Prime Time Int’l Distrib, 322 Mich App at 56. Whether th e
Court of Claims has jurisdiction in this case “turns on whether
MCL 205.429(4) confers exclusive jurisdiction on the circuit cour t
for matters involving appeals from the Department pursuant t o
the TPTA.” Prime Time Int’l Distrib, 322 Mich App at 57.
Accordingly, the Court of Claims did not err by concluding tha t
it lacked jurisdiction because the TPTA, MCL 205.429(4), confers
exclusive jurisdiction to the circuit court; MCL 205.429(4) doe s
not confer concurrent jurisdiction to any other court. Prime Time
Int’l Distrib, 322 Mich App at 57, 58 (concluding that MCL
600.6419(5) applies and the circuit court has exclusiv e
jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ appeals pursuant to the TPTA).
4. Jurisdiction Over Constitutional Tort Claims
The Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over
constitutional tort claims against the state or any of it s
departments. Rusha v Dep’t of Corrections, 307 Mich App 300, 30 5
(2014).
5. Intervention
The Court of Claims properly denied private parties’ motions t o
intervene as defendants under MCR 2.209; the private partie s
could not intervene in the action because, under MCL 600.6419,
“the Court of Claims lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over
claims against non-state actors.” Council of Orgs & Others for Ed
About Parochiaid v Michigan, 321 Mich App 456, 465 (2017), citing
Estes v Titus, 481 Mich 573, 583-584 (2008).
Under MCL 600.6419(1)(a) and MCL 600.6419(7), for the Court o f
Claims to have jurisdiction over a state officer who is seeking t o
intervene as a defendant, “the officer must have been acting, or
reasonably believed he or she was acting, within the scope of hi s
or her authority at the time of the alleged wrongful conduct, no t
at the time he or she filed a motion to intervene or become a par t
of the action.” Council of Orgs & Others for Ed About Parochiaid,
321 Mich App at 470 (holding that where the plaintiffs asserted
that state legislation was unconstitutional, state legislators could
not intervene; the Court of Claims lacked jurisdiction over the
state legislators because the plaintiffs had raised no claim s
against them “for allegedly wrongful conduct during which they
were acting, or reasonably believed that they were acting, withi n
the scope of their authority while engaged in or discharging a

government function in the course of their duties”) (quotatio n
35
marks, alteration, and citation omitted).
6. Power of Legislature to Expand Court of Claims’
Jurisdiction
Neither MCL 600.6419 (conferring jurisdiction to Court o f
Claims) nor MCL 600.6437 (authorizing the Court of Claims t o
36
issue orders against the state and its subunits) preclude the
Court of Claims from “exercis[ing] jurisdiction over any other
case, if the Legislature were to grant it additional jurisdiction.”
River Investment Group, LLC v Casab, 289 Mich App 353, 35 8
(2010).
2.8 Michigan Supreme Court and Court of Appeals
Subject-Matter Jurisdiction
The Michigan Supreme Court may issue, hear, and determin e
prerogative and remedial writs. Const 1963, art 6, § 4. It also has appellat e
jurisdiction as provided in the court rules. Id. Further, as it relates directly
to trial courts, “[t]he Supreme Court may . . . exercise superintending
37
control over a lower court or tribunal[.]” MCR 7.303(B)(5); see als o
Const 1963, art 6, § 4. Finally, although the Supreme Court does not hav e
the power to remove a judge, Const 1963, art 6, § 4, it must review a
Judicial Tenure Commission order recommending discipline, removal,
retirement, or suspension, MCR 7.303(A). Chapter 2 of the Revised
Judicature Act, MCL 600.202 et seq., also addresses the jurisdiction of th e
Supreme Court.
The Michigan’s Court of Appeals jurisdiction is provided by statute and
court rule. Const 1963, art 6, § 10. See Chapter 3 of the Revised Judicature
Act, MCL 600.301 et seq., and MCR 7.203 for more information on the
jurisdiction of the Michigan Court of Appeals.
35Generally, a municipality is not an “arm of the state” under MCL 600.6419(7), when it operates a
waterworks system, nor is it an arm of the state when it is operating under Michigan’s emergenc y
management laws. Boler v Governor, 324 Mich App 614, 619 (2018). Accordingly, the Court of Claims does
not have exclusive jurisdiction to hear claims in these situations. Id. at 630.
36MCL 600.6437 provides: “The court may order entry of judgment against the state or any of its
departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms or agencies based upon facts as stipulated b y
counsel after taking such proofs in support thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the court as to th e
accuracy of such facts and upon being satisfied that such judgment is in accordance with applicable law.”

Section 2.9 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2.9 Authority of District Court Magistrate
“A district court magistrate may hear, preside over, and conduct any o f
the following in civil infraction actions under [the Michigan vehicle code
(MVC)], MCL 257.746, the Michigan Regulation and Taxation o f
Marijuana Act [(MRTMA)], MCL 333.27951 to [MCL 333.27967], or [MCL
600.8719] or [MCL 600.8819] of [the Revised Judicature Act (RJA)], or in
civil fine actions under the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act [(MMMA)],
MCL 333.26421 to [MCL 333.26430], as applicable:
(a) Admissions.
(b) Admissions with explanation.
(c) Motions to set aside default or withdraw admissions.
(d) Informal hearings.” MCL 600.8512(1).
“In exercising the authority conferred by [MCL 600.8512(1)], a distric t
court magistrate may administer oaths, examine witnesses, and mak e
findings of fact and conclusions of law.” MCL 600.8512(2).
“If a defendant is determined to be responsible for a civil infraction, or,
under the [MMMA], a civil fine, the district court magistrate may impos e
the civil sanctions authorized by the [MVC], MCL 257.907, the
[MRTMA], or [MCL 600.8827] of [the RJA], as applicable.” MCL
600.8512(2).
“A district court magistrate may exercise the authority conferred b y
[MCL 600.8512] only to the extent expressly authorized by the chief
judge, presiding judge, or only judge of the district court district.” MCL
600.8512(4).
MCL 600.8512a provides that a district court magistrate may “[a]ccept an
admission of responsibility, decide a motion to set aside a default o r
withdraw an admission, or order civil sanctions for a civil infraction an d
order an appropriate civil sanction permitted by the statute or ordinanc e
defining the act or omission.” MCL 600.8512a(a).
2.10 Trial Court’s Authority After Appeal
A. District Courts and Agencies
Jurisdiction vests in the circuit court after a claim of appeal is filed o r
leave to appeal is granted. MCR 7.107. “After a claim of appeal is filed
[with the circuit court] or leave to appeal is granted [by the circui t
court], jurisdiction vests in the circuit court.” Id. “The trial court or
agency may not set aside or amend the judgment, order, or decisio n

appealed except by circuit court order or as otherwise provided b y
law. In all other respects, the authority of the trial court or agency i s
38
governed by MCR 7.208(C) through [MCR 7.208](I).” MCR 7.107.
For more information on circuit court appeals, see the Michiga n
Judicial Institute’s Appeals & Opinions Benchbook, Chapter 2.
B. Trial Courts (Exclusive of District Court and Agencies)
Filing the entry fee and a claim of appeal from a final judgment in th e
circuit court transfers jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals in a n
appeal of right, except as otherwise provided in MCR 3.993(D)(3) and
MCR 6.425(G)(1). MCR 7.204(B); MCL 600.308. See also Michigan State
Emp Ass’n v Civil Serv Comm, 177 Mich App 231, 245 (1989). The lower
court reacquires jurisdiction when the clerk returns the record to it.
Dep’t of Conservation v Connor, 321 Mich 648, 654 (1948); Luscombe v
Shedd’s Food Products Corp, 212 Mich App 537, 541 (1995). See MCR
7.210(H)-(J.).
“After a claim of appeal is filed or leave to appeal is granted, the trial
court or tribunal may not set aside or amend the judgment or orde r
appealed from except
(1) by order of the Court of Appeals,
(2) by stipulation of the parties,
(3) after a decision on the merits in an action in which a
preliminary injunction was granted, or
(4) as otherwise provided by law.” MCR 7.208(A).
See also Wiand v Wiand, 205 Mich App 360, 369-370 (1994) (holdin g
that “the trial court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction to gran t
plaintiff’s motion [to amend her complaint and add a claim] unde r
MCR 7.208(A) because a claim of appeal had already been filed fro m
the order of dismissal”).
The statutes authorizing a trial court to amend child and spousa l
support orders after the entry of judgment if circumstances require,
MCL 552.17(1) and MCL 552.28, satisfy the “as otherwise provided b y
law” exception in MCR 7.208(A)(4). Lemmen v Lemmen, 481 Mich 164,
167 (2008). The “as otherwise provided by law” exception in MCR
7.208(A)(4) is applicable to custody situations. Safdar v Aziz, 501 Mic h

“Except as otherwise provided by rule and until the record is filed i n
the Court of Appeals, the trial court or tribunal has jurisdiction
(1) to grant further time to do, properly perform, o r
correct any act in the trial court or tribunal in connectio n

the Court of Appeals, but only after notice to the partie s
and an opportunity for a hearing on the proposed
correction.
After the record is filed in the Court of Appeals, the trial court ma y
correct the record only with leave of the Court of Appeals.” MCR
7.208(C).
“The probate court retains continuing jurisdiction to decide othe r
matters pertaining to the proceeding from which an appeal wa s
filed.” MCR 7.208(D).
“When an appeal is filed while property is being held fo r
conservation or management under the order or judgment of the trial
court, that court retains jurisdiction over the property pending th e
outcome of the appeal, except as the Court of Appeals otherwis e
orders.” MCR 7.208(E).
“A trial court order entered before final judgment concerning custody,
control, and management of property; temporary alimony, support o r
custody of a minor child, or expenses in a domestic relations action;
or a preliminary injunction, remains in effect and is enforceable in th e
trial court, pending interlocutory appeal, except as the trial court o r
the Court of Appeals may otherwise order.” MCR 7.208(F).
“The trial court retains authority over stay and bond matters, excep t
as the Court of Appeals otherwise orders.” MCR 7.208(G). Generally,
the trial court can still enforce its orders unless there is a stay. Se e
MCR 7.209(A)(1). The trial court must first address a motion for bond
or stay of proceedings before a party can file such a motion with th e
Michigan Court of Appeals. MCR 7.209(A)(2).
“Throughout the pendency of an appeal involving an indigen t
person, the trial court retains authority to appoint, remove, or replac e
an attorney except as the Court of Appeals otherwise orders.” MCR
7.208(H).

2.11 Federal Court Subject-Matter Jurisdiction
A. Removal
The most common grounds for federal court jurisdiction are federal
question (28 USC 1331) and diversity of citizenship (28 USC 1332). A n
action originally filed in a state court may be removed to federal cour t
if: (1) the case could have originally been filed in a federal court; and
(2) for cases removed on the basis of diversity, no defendant is a
citizen of the state where the action is filed. 28 USC 1441. Removal of a
state case to federal court is governed by 28 USC 1441–28 USC 1455.
Federal law controls the criteria for removal. Grubbs v Gen Elec Credit
Corp, 405 US 699, 705 (1972). If the federal court concludes that it doe s
not have jurisdiction, it must remand the case. 28 USC 1447(c); 28 USC
1455(b)(4).
Only a defendant may exercise the right of removal; the trial cour t
does not have authority to remove a case to federal court. See 28 USC
1441(a); 28 USC 1455(a).
“Promptly after the filing of [a] notice of removal of a civil action th e
defendant or defendants shall give written notice thereof to all
adverse parties and shall file a copy of the notice with the clerk o f
such State court, which shall effect the removal and the State cour t
shall proceed no further unless and until the case is remanded.” 28
USC 1446(d).
The federal court in which the notice of removal is filed must examin e
it promptly, and “[i]f it clearly appears on the face of the notice and
any exhibits annexed thereto that removal should not be permitted,
the court shall make an order for summary remand.” 28 USC
1455(b)(4).
If the federal court does not summarily remand the prosecution, a n
evidentiary hearing must be held promptly, and the federal court,
after the hearing, “shall make such disposition of the prosecution a s
justice shall require. If the [federal court] determines that removal
shall be permitted, it shall so notify the State court in whic h
prosecution is pending, which shall proceed no further.” 28 USC
1455(b)(5).
Where there are multiple claims or multiple parties, a defendant ma y
remove a whole case if it contains a separate and independent clai m
or cause of action within federal question jurisdiction. 28 USC 1441.

Section 2.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
B. Bankruptcy
“[F]or those matters that merely arise under, arise in, or are otherwis e
related to a bankruptcy case, the [federal] district court has original
jurisdiction, but such jurisdiction is not exclusive”; “[r]ather, the
federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and the matter s
can be heard by either one.” Southfield v Shefa, LLC, 340 Mich App 391,
410 (2022). “[I]n a dispute involving a hotel whose owner entered and
exited federal bankruptcy proceedings, and now the city where th e
hotel is located seeks [declaratory relief, appointment of receiver, and
judicial foreclosure] from that owner for alleged violations of stat e
law,” “the circuit court erred in concluding that . . . [it] did not hav e
subject-matter jurisdiction over any of the city’s claims.” Id. at 394 ,
39
416.
2.12 Personal Jurisdiction
Personal jurisdiction is defined as a “‘court’s power to bring a person int o
its adjudicative process.’” Foster v Wolkowitz, 486 Mich 356, 367 n 2 2
(2010), quoting Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed). Jurisdiction over a perso n
is distinct from jurisdiction over a case (subject-matter jurisdiction).
Foster, 486 Mich at 367. “[A] party may stipulate to, waive, or implicitl y
consent to personal jurisdiction.” People v Lown, 488 Mich 242, 268 (2011).
See also Lease Acceptance Corp v Adams, 272 Mich App 209, 229 (2006)
(quotation marks and citation omitted) (“[c]hallenges to personal
jurisdiction may be waived by either express or implied consent”). Lac k
of personal jurisdiction is waived if it is not raised in the responsiv e
pleading or first motion, whichever is filed first. MCR 2.111(F)(2); MCR
2.116(D)(1).
A. General Personal Jurisdiction
“The exercise of general jurisdiction is possible when a defendant’ s
contacts with the forum state are of such nature and quality as t o
enable a court to adjudicate an action against the defendant, eve n
when the claim at issue does not arise out of the contacts with th e
forum state.” Electrolines, Inc v Prudential Assurance Co, Ltd, 260 Mic h
App 144, 166 (2003), citing Oberlies v Searchmont Resort, Inc, 246 Mic h
App 424, 427 (2001).

1. Forum Selection and Choice of Law Clauses
Generally, parties may create contractual forum selectio n
clauses. Lease Acceptance Corp v Adams, 272 Mich App 209, 21 9
(2006). Subject to certain conditions, Michigan courts will
enforce an express forum selection clause where the partie s
agreed in writing to bring an action in Michigan and “the

Section 2.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
agreement provides the only basis for the exercise of
44
jurisdiction.” MCL 600.745(2). The conditions listed in MCL
600.745(2) are:
“(a) The court has power under the law of this state
to entertain the action.
(b) This state is a reasonably convenient place for
the trial of the action.
(c) The agreement as to the place of the action i s
not obtained by misrepresentation, duress, the
abuse of economic power, or other unconscionable
means.
(d) The defendant is served with process a s
provided by court rules.”
“In general, Michigan courts enforce forum-selection clauses,
and Michigan’s public policy favors the enforcement of
contractual forum-selection clauses and choice-of-law
provisions.” Superior Roll, LLC v Machinery Mktg Int'l, LLC, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). Subject to certain exceptions, Michigan courts mus t
stay or dismiss an action that was brought in Michigan where
“the parties agreed in writing that an action . . . shall be brough t
only in another state[.]” MCL 600.745(3). The exceptions listed i n
MCL 600.745(3) are:
“(a) The court is required by statute to entertai n
the action.
(b) The plaintiff cannot secure effective relief in the
other state for reasons other than delay in bringing
the action.
(c) The other state would be a substantially les s
convenient place for the trial of the action than thi s
state.
(d) The agreement as to the place of the action i s
obtained by misrepresentation, duress, the abuse
of economic power, or other unconscionable
means.
(e) It would for some other reason be unfair or
unreasonable to enforce the agreement.”
44Similarly, subject to certain conditions, Michigan courts will enforce a contractual choice of law
provision. Chrysler Corp v Skyline Indus Servs Inc, 448 Mich 113, 126-127 (1995).
Page 2-44 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 125 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.12
“If none of the exceptions listed in Subdivisions (a) through (e)
applies, then Michigan courts will enforce the parties’
contractual forum-selection clause as written pursuant t o
MCL 600.745(3).” Barshaw v Allegheny Performance Plastics, LLC,
334 Mich App 741, 749 (2020). Accordingly, “when presente d
with a contractual forum-selection clause, a court’s first step is t o
determine the threshold issue whether a party is bound by a
contract, and, accordingly, any forum selection and choice-of-
law provision in the contract.” Id. at 748 (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “A contractual forum selection clause, thoug h
otherwise valid, may not be enforced against one not bound by
the contract.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Notably, “when two merchants orally agree to a transaction, and
one merchant subsequently sends a document to the other
merchant with a forum-selection clause, that clause is no t
included as part of the parties’ agreement because it constitute s
a material alteration of the preexisting agreement.” Superior Roll,
___ Mich App at ___. In Superior Roll, the evidence indicated that
“the parties reached an agreement to purchase [a] machine
either orally by phone or through informal e-mail
communications, or both.” Id. at ___. Subsequently, the
defendant sent an invoice to plaintiff that included a forum-
selection clause. Id. at ___. “[T]he machine quickly developed
problems, which defendant failed to correct at its own expense”
despite “its representation that it would provide a 30-day
warranty to plaintiff.” Id. at ___. When the plaintiff sought t o
recover repair expenses and lost profits, “defendant argued that
the trial court was required to apply the forum-selection clause
in the invoice pursuant to MCL 600.745(3) . . . .” Superior Roll, __ _
Mich App at ___. However, the Court of Appeals agreed with
plaintiff “that under UCC 2-207, see MCL 440.2207, the forum-
selection clause set forth in the invoice was not a part of the
parties’ agreement.” Superior Roll, ___ Mich App at ___ (notin g
that the defendant did not dispute or otherwise deny that the
parties had an informal agreement that predated the invoice).
“Thus, as comment 1 to UCC 2-207 explains, MCL 440.2207
governs . . . because there is written confirmation, where an
agreement has been reached either orally or by informal
correspondence between the parties and is followed by one or
both of the parties sending formal memoranda embodying the
terms so far as agreed upon and adding terms not discussed.” Id.
at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). Because th e
forum-selection clause in the invoice materially altered the
parties’ earlier agreement and “plaintiff did not otherwise agree
to the forum-selection term, it did not become a part of th e
parties’ agreement.” Superior Roll, ___ Mich App at __ _
(declining to address whether the trial court had subject-matter
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-45
=== Page 126 ===
Section 2.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction because the underlying
question on appeal was simply whether the forum-selectio n
clause governed the dispute).
“[T]he analysis becomes more complicated when . . . a single
agreement contains both a forum-selection clause and a choice-
of-law provision.” Barshaw, 334 Mich App at 749 (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Addressing the question of
whether a contractual forum-selection clause should be
governed by the law of the state where the action was filed or, i n
the alternative, the law selected by the parties in the choice-of-
law provision, . . . this question does not concern the underlyin g
merits of the lawsuit and will only affect where the action i s
litigated. In this respect, dismissing an action under a
contractual forum-selection clause is analogous to dismissing a n
action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.” Id. at 751.
“Dismissal for forum non conveniens reflects a court’s assessmen t
of a range of considerations, most notably the convenience to the
parties and the practical difficulties that can attend the
adjudication of a dispute in a certain locality.” Id. at 753.
“[T]he question to be answered by a court considering whether
to dismiss an action pursuant to a contractual forum-selectio n
clause is similar to the question facing a court considering
whether to dismiss an action under the doctrine of forum no n
conveniens; namely, whether there is a sufficient reason that th e
action should be litigated in another forum rather than the one i n
which the plaintiff filed the action. The difference between the
two situations is that a dismissal on forum non conveniens
grounds is based on concepts related to convenience, the ends of
justice, court administration, and other relevant considerations,
whereas a dismissal pursuant to a forum-selection clause i s
based on honoring the contractual agreement reached betwee n
the parties[.]” Barshaw, 334 Mich App at 753-754 (citations
omitted). “[A] forum selection clause can be understood as the
embodiment of the parties’ negotiation for the most convenien t
or best forum.” Id. at 755.
“Because of the similarities between the operation of a forum-
selection clause and the doctrine of forum non conveniens i n
both effect and underlying purpose, . . . analyzing the validit y
and effect of a forum-selection clause is also a threshold,
nonmerits issue that the Michigan court in which the action ha s
been filed may address first before considering other threshold
issues.” Barshaw, 334 Mich App at 755. “[A] forum-selectio n
clause may [generally] be considered separately from an y
choice-of-law provision that may also be in the contract. In suc h
cases, the Michigan court in which the action has been filed shall
apply Michigan law in determining the effect of the forum-

=== Page 127 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.12
selection clause.” Id. (indicating that factors not germane to thi s
case may be present that could alter this analysis).
“MCL 600.745(3) plainly indicates that when an action is filed i n
a Michigan court, the court is required to consider dismissing or
staying the action if the parties agreed in writing that any suc h
action was required to be brought only in another state. Thus,
under the statute, there must be an agreement to litigat e
exclusively in another state before a Michigan court is required t o
dismiss the action on the basis of a forum-selection clause.”
Barshaw, 334 Mich App at 757-758 (absent exclusivity language,
the forum-selection clause is considered permissive). In Barshaw,
because there was nothing in the forum-selection clause
“evidencing an intent by the parties to forgo the personal
jurisdiction of all forums other than those within the state of
Pennsylvania,” the Court could not “infer from the language of
the clause that the parties agreed that Pennsylvania would be th e
sole forum in which they could litigate disputes to the exclusio n
of all other forums.” Id. at 760-761 (concluding the trial cour t
“was not required to dismiss [the] case under MCL 600.745(3)”
because the forum-selection clause at issue was “permissive
under Michigan law,” and the clause “provided tha t
Pennsylvania was one potential appropriate forum withou t
excluding the use of other appropriate forums”).
B. Limited Personal Jurisdiction
A long-arm statute provides “for jurisdiction over a nonresiden t
defendant who has had contacts with the territory where the statute i s
45
in effect.” Black’s Law Dictionary (8th ed).
The following list contains authority regarding limited personal
jurisdiction over individuals and entities.
46
• Individuals — MCL 600.705, which states, “[A]ny of
the following relationships between an individual or hi s
agent and the state . . . enable a court . . . to exercis e
limited personal jurisdiction over the individua l
and . . . to render personal judgments against the
individual or his representative arising out of an ac t
which creates any of the following relationships:
[47]
(1) The transaction of any business within the state.
45 See Section 2.12(C) for a discussion of constitutional limitations on jurisdiction.
46See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Personal Jurisdiction of Individuals Flowchart.
47 “The word ‘any’ means just what is says. It includes ‘each’ and ‘every.’” Sifers v Horen, 385 Mich 195, 19 9
n 2 (1971).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-47
=== Page 128 ===
Section 2.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(2) The doing or causing an act to be done, or
consequences to occur, in the state resulting in an actio n
[48]
for tort.
(3) The ownership, use, or possession of real or tangible
personal property situated within the state;
(4) Contracting to insure a person, property or ris k
located in this state at the time of contracting.
(5) Entering into a contract for services to be rendered o r
for materials to be furnished in the state by th e
[49]
defendant.
(6) Acting as a director, manager, trustee, or othe r
officer of a corporation incorporated under the laws of,
or having its principal place of business within thi s
state.
(7) Maintaining a domicile in this state while subject to a
marital or family relationship which is the basis of the
claim for divorce, alimony, separate maintenance,
property settlement, child support, or child custody. ”
MCL 600.705(1)-(7).
50
• Corporations — MCL 600.715.
51
• Partnerships and limited partnerships — MCL 600.725.
• Partnership associations and unincorporated voluntary
52
associations — MCL 600.735.
C. Constitutional Limitations
Due process limits the power of a state court to render a valid
personal judgment against a nonresident defendant. Shaffer v Heitner,
433 US 186, 204 (1977); Kulko v Superior Court of California, 436 US 84 ,
91 (1978). Due process requirements must be met in addition t o
satisfying the requirements of the Michigan long-arm statutes. Se e
48 “[E]ither the tortious conduct or the injury must occur in Michigan.” WH Froh, Inc v Domanski, 252 Mich
App 220, 229 (2002).
49“F.O.B. shipping terms are not dispositive of whether the defendant entered into a contract for materials
to be furnished in Michigan.” Starbrite Distrib, Inc v Excelda Mfg Co, 454 Mich 302, 304 (1997).

Oberlies v Searchmont Resort, Inc, 246 Mich App 424, 432 (2001). There
must be both:
• Adequate notice that suit has been brought. Mullane v
Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co, 339 US 306, 313 (1950);
Krueger v Williams, 410 Mich 144, 158 (1981), and
• “Minimum contacts” between the state and the
defendant. Int’l Shoe Co v Washington, 326 US 310, 31 6
(1945); Jeffrey v Rapid American Corp, 448 Mich 178, 185-
186 (1995).
The Michigan Supreme Court identified a three-part test for
determining minimum contacts in Jeffrey, 448 Mich at 186:
(1) The defendant must purposefully avail himself o f
the privilege of acting in the forum state;
(2) The cause of action must arise from the defendant’ s
activities in the forum state; and
(3) The defendant’s acts must have a substantial enoug h
connection with the forum state to make the exercise o f
53
jurisdiction reasonable.
“[Michigan’s] ‘long-arm’ statutes extend jurisdiction to the maximu m
limits permitted by due process.” Northern Ins Co of New York v B
Elliott, Ltd, 117 Mich App 308, 316 (1982), citing Sifers v Horen, 38 5
Mich 195, 199 (1971).
“The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing [personal] jurisdictio n
over the defendant[.]” Yoost v Caspari, 295 Mich App 209, 221 (2012)
(citations and quotation marks omitted). To succeed against a pretrial
motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a plaintiff nee d
only make a prima facie showing. Id. “The plaintiff’s complaint mus t
be accepted as true unless specifically contradicted by affidavits o r
other evidence submitted by the parties.” Id. “[W]hen allegations i n
the pleadings are contradicted by documentary evidence, th e
plaintiff . . . must produce admissible evidence of his or her prim a
facie case establishing jurisdiction.” Id. “‘To be adequate, a plaintiff’ s
circumstantial proof must facilitate reasonable inferences . . ., no t
mere speculation.’” Id. at 228, quoting Skinner v Square D Co, 445 Mic h
153, 164 (1994).
Where a party’s only contact with Michigan is through it s
advertisements, the advertising party’s conduct may fall withi n

Partnerships or Limited Partnerships, and Partnership Associations or Unincorporated Voluntary
Associations.

Section 2.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Michigan’s long-arm statute, but it may not be enough to provid e
personal jurisdiction over the advertising party. Oberlies, 246 Mic h
App at 437-439. In Oberlies, the plaintiff (a Michigan resident) wa s
injured at the defendant’s facility (located in Canada). Id. at 426. The
plaintiff argued that because the defendant directed it s
advertisements at Michigan residents, Michigan could obtai n
personal jurisdiction over the defendant for purposes of a negligenc e
suit. Id. The Michigan Court of Appeals disagreed and stated:
“[I]n order for a foreign defendant to be compelled t o
defend a suit brought in Michigan where th e
defendant’s contacts with Michigan are limited solely t o
advertising aimed at Michigan residents, th e
defendant’s instate advertising activities must, in a
natural and continuous sequence, have caused th e
alleged injuries forming the basis of the plaintiff’s caus e
of action.” Oberlies, 246 Mich App at 437.
When personal jurisdiction is authorized by MCL 600.701(3) and
MCL 600.745, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction i n
Michigan via a valid forum selection clause, enforcement of the foru m
selection clause “does not violate due process as long as a party wil l
not be deprived of its day in court.” Lease Acceptance Corp v Adams, 272
Mich App 209, 229 (2006).
Where personal jurisdiction is conferred pursuant to a foru m
selection clause, and where the inconvenience of litigating in anothe r
forum is apparent at the time of contracting, that inconvenience i s
part of the bargain negotiated by the parties and will not render th e
forum selection clause unenforceable. Turcheck v Amerifund Fin, Inc,
272 Mich App 341, 350 (2006).
“Pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act’s catch-all
provision regarding personal jurisdiction, a forum state may exercise
personal jurisdiction over petitions for enforcement of out-of-stat e
support claims, . . . if there is any other basis consistent with the
constitutions of [Michigan] and the United States for the exercise of
personal jurisdiction.” Hilyard v Johnston, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2023)
(cleaned up). Where “the statute includes a catchall provision tha t
only requires a court to consider constitutional due process, the two
inquiries collapse into a single inquiry regarding minimum contacts. ”
Id. at ___. The Hilyard Court concluded that “personal jurisdictio n
may exist regardless of whether the respondent-father’s action s
satisfy any provision of MCL 600.705,” holding that “the circuit cour t
was obligated under MCL 552.2201(1)(h) to analyze whether du e
process is satisfied here by determining whether sufficient minimu m
contacts exist between a nonresident respondent and the state to
support due process requirements of limited personal jurisdiction. ”
Hilyard, ___ Mich at ___ (cleaned up).

D. Standard of Review
Whether a court has personal jurisdiction over a party is a question o f
law that is reviewed de novo. Oberlies v Searchmont Resort, Inc, 24 6
Mich App 424, 426 (2001).
2.13 Actions In Rem and Quasi In Rem
“[A]ctions in personam differ from actions in rem in that actions o r
proceedings in personam are directed against a specific person, and see k
the recovery of a personal judgment, while actions or proceedings in re m
are directed against the thing or property itself, the object of which is t o
subject it directly to the power of the state, to establish the status o r
condition thereof, or determine its disposition, and procure a judgmen t
which shall be binding and conclusive against the world. Th e
distinguishing characteristics of an action in rem [are] its local rather tha n
transitory nature, and its power to adjudicate the rights of all persons i n
the thing.” Detroit v 19675 Hasse, 258 Mich App 438, 448 (2003), quotin g
1A CJS, Actions, § 69, pp 463-464.
In rem— “Involving or determining the status of a thing, and therefor e
the rights of persons generally with respect to that thing.” Black’s La w
Dictionary (8th ed).
Quasi in rem— “Involving or determining the rights of a person having
an interest in property located within the court’s jurisdiction.” Black’s La w
Dictionary (8th ed).
The following list of statutes provides authority for determining th e
appropriate jurisdiction of the piece of property in question:
• MCL 600.751 — Land in Michigan.
• MCL 600.755 — Chattels (movable or transferable property )
in Michigan.
• MCL 600.761 — Documents in Michigan.
• MCL 600.765 — Corporate stock of Michigan corporation s
and other stock with a specified relationship to Michigan.
• MCL 600.771 — Obligations owed by persons subject to the
jurisdiction of Michigan courts.

2.14 Venue
Venue is simply the location of the trial. Determining proper venu e
ensures the selection of a fair and convenient location where the merits o f
a dispute can be adjudicated. Gross v Gen Motors Corp, 448 Mich 147, 155
(1995). “[T]he primary goal is to minimize the costs of litigation . . . b y
reducing the burdens on the parties, [and] by considering the strains o n
the system as a whole.” Id. “Courts evaluate convenience primarily i n
terms of the interests of the parties and any relevant witnesses.” Id.
“[P]laintiffs carry the burden of establishing the propriety of their venu e
choice, and the resolution of a venue dispute generally occurs befor e
meaningful discovery has occurred.” Id. at 155-156.
“[V]enue is controlled by statute [(MCL 600.1621)] in Michigan.” Omne
Fin, Inc v Shacks, Inc, 460 Mich 305, 309 (1999). Because “the Legislature
declined to provide that parties may contractually agree to venue i n
advance, [the Michigan Supreme Court] decline[d] to read into th e
statute a provision requiring enforcement of such agreements.” Id. at 311-
312. In most cases, venue is proper where the defendant (1) resides, (2) has
a place of business or conducts business, or (3) if the defendant is a
corporation, where the registered office is located. MCL 600.1621(a). If n o
defendant meets any of these criteria, venue may be proper where th e
plaintiff (1) resides, (2) has a place of business or conducts business, or (3 )
has a registered office, if the plaintiff is a corporation. MCL 600.1621(b).
Actions against court-appointed fiduciaries should be brought in th e
county where the fiduciary was appointed. MCL 600.1621(c). Specifi c
statutes govern proper venue in actions involving: replevin and real
property; probate bonds; governmental units; and multiple causes o f
action involving a tort or involving another legal theory seeking damage s
for personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death. See MCL
600.1605, MCL 600.1611, MCL 600.1615, MCL 600.1629, and MCL
600.1641 respectively.
Multiple types of claims. “MCL 600.1641 addresses proper venue [in]
cases where there is more than one type of claim raised in the complaint.”
Dep't of Health and Human Servs v NRK RX, Inc, ___ Mich App ___, ___
(2024). “If more than 1 cause of action is pleaded in the complaint or
added by amendment at any time during the action and 1 of the causes o f
action is based on tort or another legal theory seeking damages fo r
personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death, venue shall b e
determined under the rules applicable to actions in tort as provided i n
[MCL 600.1629].” MCL 600.1641(2). “MCL 600.1641(2) mandates tha t
MCL 600.1629 controls the selection of venue for this tort action, whic h
arose in Oakland County, regardless of whether the action was brough t
by the Attorney General or a private party.” NRK RX, Inc, ___ Mich App
at ___.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.14
Tort actions. “MCL 600.1629 provides a hierarchy of criteria for
determining the proper venue in tort actions.” NRK RX, Inc, ___ Mic h
App at ___. When applying MCL 600.1629(1)(a), courts must determine
the county in which the original injury occurred. NRK RX, Inc, ___ Mic h
App at ___. In NRK RX, Inc, on behalf of the Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS), the Attorney General pleaded “tort claims fo r
common-law conversion and statutory conversion related to Medicaid
overpayments, MCL 400.111b(16).” NRK RX, Inc, ___ Mich App at ___.
The Court of Appeals concluded that venue was proper in Oakland
County because “the original injury occurred in Oakland County, th e
county in which NRK has its corporate office and where it refused t o
return the funds to DHHS.” Id. at ___; see MCL 600.1629(1)(a)(ii).The
Court further observed that “the Legislature’s command in MCL 600.1641
that ‘venue shall be determined under the rules applicable to actions i n
tort as provided in [MCL 600.1629],’ means just that, and there is no carve
out for actions brought by DHHS nor is there an exception made fo r
MCL 14.102 and MCL 600.1631(a).” NRK RX, Inc, ___ Mich App at __ _
(“We cannot fathom a more unambiguous directive than that found i n
MCL 600.1641(2), ‘venue shall be determined under the rules applicable
to actions in tort as provided in [MCL 600.1629].’”).
Paternity actions. “[P]aternity determinations, and the venu e
requirements the legislature has imposed for making them, involv e
matters of substantive law involving important public polic y
considerations concerning the welfare and support of children.” Rose v
May, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “MCL 722.714(1) requires a plaintiff
to file a paternity complaint in the county where the mother or child
resides.” Rose, ___ Mich App at ___. “If DHHS exercises its authority t o
file a paternity complaint, the complaint must be filed ‘in the circuit court
in the county in which the child resides.’” Id. at ___, quoting MCL
722.714(12). “But when the same parents have a prior support order ,
[MCR 3.204(A)(2)] purports to require that a new action for a differen t
child must be filed in the same county as the prior action if the circui t
court for that county has jurisdiction over the new action . . . .” Rose, ___
Mich App at ___ (quotation marks omitted). The Rose Court noted tha t
“MCL 722.714 and MCR 3.204 appear to conflict . . . .” Rose, ___ Mich
App at ___. However, “because MCL 722.714 addresses the public polic y
of providing support for children born out of wedlock, and more
specifically requires that a paternity action is to be filed in the count y
where the mother or child resides, the mandatory venue provision of the
statute is most appropriately categorized as a substantive rule dictatin g
the proper venue for a paternity complaint.” Rose, ___ Mich App at ___ .
“The venue provision itself is a declaration of legislative intent tha t
paternity determinations, which involve the familial relations and
financial support obligations owed to minor children, shall in thi s
instance be made in the county where the child resides, as opposed to
some other jurisdiction potentially long distant from the child’s place o f
residence.” Id. at ___.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-53
=== Page 134 ===
Section 2.14 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
In Rose, “the Michigan Office of Child Support, a division of the [DHHS],
sent a referral to the Gladwin County Prosecutor’s Office requestin g
establishment of paternity and support for the minor child, in accordanc e
with MCL 722.714(12).” Rose, ___ Mich App at ___. “The trial cour t
determined that because the parties’ older child had a child suppor t
order in Oakland County, MCR 3.204(A)(2) required that [the minor
child’s] complaint for paternity be filed there as well.” Rose, ___ Mich
App at ___. “This was error.” Id. at ___. “Because the child resided in
Gladwin County at the time the complaint was filed, the Gladwin Circui t
Court was the exclusive venue to hear the paternity complaint.” Id. at ___
(noting that the minor child “was not born in Oakland County and ha s
never resided there”). Furthermore, “it would be grossly inefficient t o
require plaintiff to travel to Oakland County to proceed in an action fo r
paternity of a child who resides with mother in Gladwin County jus t
because there is a support case involving the parties’ older child pendin g
in Oakland County.” Rose, ___ Mich App at ___.
A. Change of Venue Generally
Once a court enters an order granting a change of venue, it lose s
jurisdiction over any subsequent proceedings, including th e
jurisdiction to “entertain [a] motion for reconsideration or any othe r
substantive issue other than the costs and expenses relative to th e
transfer.” Frankfurth v Detroit Med Ctr, 297 Mich App 654, 662 (2012).
To avoid any “serious inconvenience” to the parties, a good practic e
“might be to make orders changing venue effective as of som e
reasonable time thereafter[.]” Id. at 662. Failure to do so results in a n
immediate loss of jurisdiction. Id. at 660 (“unless otherwise explicitl y
specified, orders are effective when signed by the judge”).
The court rules distinguish between motions for change of proper
54 55
venue , MCR 2.222, and improper venue , MCR 2.223.
“[C]ontractual venue provisions are not binding on Michiga n
courts, . . . [and] such agreements do not constitute a waiver of a
party’s right to challenge venue, nor do they constitute a consent to a
change of venue.” Omne Fin, Inc v Shacks, Inc, 226 Mich App 397, 40 7
(1997).
B. Timing
“A motion for change of venue must be filed before or at the time th e
defendant files an answer.” MCR 2.221(A). See also Hills & Dales Ge n
Hosp v Pantig, 295 Mich App 14, 19 (2011) (filing the motion on th e
54See Section 2.14(C).
55See Section 2.14(D).
Page 2-54 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 135 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.14
same day as answering the complaint satisfied the requirement i n
MCR 2.221(A)). However, the court cannot deny a late motion if it “i s
satisfied that the facts on which the motion is based were not and
could not with reasonable diligence have been known to the movin g
party more than 14 days before the motion was filed.” MCR 2.221(B).
If the defendant fails to object to venue within the time limitations se t
forth in MCR 2.221, he or she waives the right to object. MCR
2.221(C). “The failure to timely raise a claim of improper venue in th e
lower court precludes consideration of the claim on appeal.” Saba v
Gray, 111 Mich App 304, 307 (1981). Raising improper venue as a n
affirmative defense will not satisfy the requirement that a change o f
venue motion must be filed. Bursley v Fuksa, 164 Mich App 772, 77 9
(1987).
C. Change of Proper Venue
Venue of a civil action brought in a proper court may be changed t o
any other county on grounds permitted by court rule. MCL 600.1655.
MCR 2.222(A) allows a change of proper venue “for the convenienc e
of parties and witnesses or when an impartial trial cannot be had
where the action is pending.” “[T]he moving party has the burden o f
making a persuasive showing of inconvenience justifying a change o f
venue.” Kohn v Ford Motor Co, 151 Mich App 300, 305 (1986) (using
common sense and logical inferences, the judge properly found tha t
“a far greater number of witnesses would be inconvenienced if trial
were held in Wayne County than if the case were to be transferred t o
Tuscola County”). If venue is proper, the court may not change venu e
on its own initiative; a motion is required. MCR 2.222(B).
1. Order for Change of Venue, Case Records, and
Required Fees
“The transferring court must enter all necessary order s
pertaining to the certification and transfer of the action to the
receiving court” and “order the party that moved for change of
venue to pay the applicable statutory filing fee to the receiving
court, unless fees have been waived in accordance with MCR
56
2.002.” MCR 2.222(D)(1). The order must be entered on a
SCAO-approved form. MCR 2.226(A). If the order “is no t
prepared as required under [MCR 2.226(A)], and the order lack s
the information necessary for the receiving court to determine
under which rule the transfer was ordered, the clerk of the
56“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002], courts must enable a litigant who seeks a fee
waiver to do so by an entirely electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L). See Section 1.11 for more information on
waiver of fees.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-55

Section 2.14 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
receiving court shall refuse to accept the transfer and shall
prepare a notice of refusal on a form approved by the [SCAO]
and return the case to the transferring court for a proper order
within seven business days of receipt of the transfer order.”
MCR 2.226(B). Upon receipt of a refusal to accept a transfered
case under MCR 2.226(B), the transferring court must “prepare a
proper order in accordance with [MCR 2.226(A)] and retransfer
the case within seven business days.” MCR 2.226(C).
“The transferring court must serve the order [of transfer] on th e
parties and send a copy to the receiving court. The clerk of the
transferring court must prepare the case records for transfer i n
accordance with the orders entered under [MCR 2.222(D)(1)]
and the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards
and send them to the receiving court by a secure method.” MCR
2.222(D)(2). “The receiving court must temporarily suspend
payment of the filing fee and open a case pending payment of
the filing fee as ordered by the transferring court. The receiving
court must notify the party that moved for change of venue of
the new case number in the receiving court, the amount due, and
the due date.” MCR 2.222(D)(3).
“If a jury fee has been paid, the clerk of the transferring cour t
must forward it to the clerk of the receiving court as soon a s
possible after the case records have been transferred.” MCR
2.222(E)(2).
2. Proceedings After Transfer
If the court grants the motion to change venue, the moving party
must pay the applicable filing fee within 28 days of the date of
the transfer order. MCR 2.222(E)(1). “No further action may b e
had in the case until payment is made,” and the receiving cour t
must order the case transferred back to the transferring court if
the fee is not paid within 28 days of the date of the original
transfer order. Id.
D. Change of Improper Venue
To determine whether venue is improper, the court should consul t
MCL 600.1621.
If venue is improper, the court:
“(1) shall order a change of venue on timely motion of a
defendant, or
Page 2-56 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 137 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.14
(2) may order a change of venue on its own initiativ e
with notice to the parties and opportunity for them to b e
heard on the venue question.” MCR 2.223(A).
A plaintiff cannot seek a change of venue under MCR 2.223(A)
because the rule permits a venue change only “on timely motion of a
defendant” or on the court’s “own initiative.” Dawley v Hall, 501 Mic h
166, 169-170 (2018) (holding that “by expressly recognizing that th e
defendant and the court can effect a change in venue, but includin g
no similar provision for the plaintiff, the rule . . . must be read t o
exclude the plaintiff”). Similarly, MCL 600.1651 allows only the
defendant to move for a change of venue and must be read to exclud e
the plaintiff. Dawley, 501 Mich at 170-171 (contrasting MCR 2.222,
which permits a court in a proper venue to transfer a case “on motio n
of a party”). A plaintiff can challenge an order transferring venue b y
filing “a motion for rehearing or reconsideration within 21 day s
[57]
pursuant to MCR 2.119(F)(1), or by filing an application for leave
to appeal, MCR 7.205.” Dawley, 501 Mich at 172.
It is the plaintiff’s burden to establish that the county chosen is th e
proper venue. Karpinski v St John Hosp - Macomb Ctr Corp, 238 Mic h
App 539, 547 (1999). Upon the defendant’s timely motion to chang e
venue and a finding that venue is improper, the trial court mus t
transfer the case to a county with proper venue. MCL 600.1651; MCR
2.223(A); Miller v Allied Signal, Inc, 235 Mich App 710, 716-717 (1999).
1. Order for Change of Venue, Case Records, and
Required Fees
“The transferring court must enter all necessary order s
pertaining to the certification and transfer of the action to the
receiving court” and “order the plaintiff to pay the applicable
statutory filing fee directly to the receiving court, unless fee s
58
have been waived in accordance with MCR 2.002.” MCR
2.223(B)(1). The order must be entered on a SCAO-approved
form. MCR 2.226(A). If the order “is not prepared as required
under [MCR 2.226(A)], and the order lacks the informatio n
necessary for the receiving court to determine under which rule
the transfer was ordered, the clerk of the receiving court shall
refuse to accept the transfer and shall prepare a notice of refusal
on a form approved by the [SCAO] and return the case to the
transferring court for a proper order within seven business day s
of receipt of the transfer order.” MCR 2.226(B). Upon receipt of a
57See Section 4.3.
58“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002], courts must enable a litigant who seeks a fee
waiver to do so by an entirely electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L). See Section 1.11 for more information on
waiver of fees.

refusal to accept a transfered case under MCR 2.226(B), th e
transferring court must “prepare a proper order in accordance
with [MCR 2.226(A)] and retransfer the case within seve n
business days.” MCR 2.226(C). “The court may also order th e
plaintiff to pay reasonable compensation and attorney fees to the
defendant if the case was filed in the wrong court.” MCR
2.223(B)(1).
“The transferring court must serve the order [of transfer] on the
parties and send a copy to the receiving court. The clerk of the
transferring court must prepare the case records for transfer i n
accordance with the orders entered under [MCR 2.223(B)(1)] and
the Michigan Trial Court Records Management Standards and
send them to the receiving court by a secure method.” MCR
2.223(B)(2). “The receiving court must temporarily suspen d
payment of the filing fee and open a case pending payment of
the filing fee and costs as ordered by the transferring court. The
receiving court must notify the plaintiff of the new case number
in the receiving court, the amount due, and the due date.” MCR
2.223(B)(3).
“If a jury fee has been paid, the clerk of the transferring cour t
must forward it to the clerk of the receiving court as soon a s
possible after the case records have been transferred.” MCR
2.223(C)(2).
2. Proceedings After Transfer
The receiving court must dismiss the action if the plaintiff doe s
not pay the applicable filing fee, costs, and expenses as ordered
by the transferring court within 28 days of the date of the
transfer order. MCR 2.223(C)(1). “No further proceedings may
be had in the action until payment has been made.” Id.
E. Standard of Review
A circuit court’s decision to grant or deny a motion to change venue i s
reviewed for clear error. Dep't of Health and Human Servs v NRK RX,
Inc, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). “‘Clear error exists when th e
reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a
mistake has been made.’” Id. at ___, quoting Massey v Mandell, 46 2
Mich 375, 379 (2000). Questions of statutory interpretation ar e
reviewed de novo. NRK RX, Inc, ___ Mich App at ___.

2.15 Standing and Real Party In Interest Requirements
“While the [standing and real party in interest] doctrines functio n
similarly in practice, they are derived from different sources and serv e
different purposes.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co,
___ Mich ___, ___ (2025) (referring to the real party in interest rule as a
standing doctrine is an imprecise description). “As a result, it is incorrec t
to assume that all features of our standing doctrine necessarily carry ove r
to the real party in interest context—or vice versa.” Id. at ___. “Similarly,
the fact that a plaintiff is not the real party in interest does not necessaril y
mean that the suit will fail for lack of standing.” Id. at ___.
A. Standing
“Standing generally refers to the right of a plaintiff initially to invok e
the power of a trial court to adjudicate a claimed injury.” C-Spine
Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025 )
(quotation marks and citations omitted). “Under Michigan law,
standing is a limited, prudential doctrine, intended to assess whethe r
a litigant’s interest in the issue is sufficient to ensure sincere and
vigorous advocacy.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted)
(“not[ing] that standing is a distinct question from the merits of th e
case and that it is not necessary to address the merits to determin e
whether a plaintiff has standing”).
“Michigan’s standing doctrine grew out of cases where parties wer e
seeking writs of mandamus to compel a public officer to perform a
statutory duty.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Historically, it has played its greatest role in cases involving publi c
rights, but [the Michigan Supreme Court has] also invoked standin g
in cases involving private rights.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citations omitted). See Bowie v Arder, 441 Mich 23, 42 (1992); Allstate
Ins Co v Hayes, 442 Mich 56, 68-69 (1993).
“In Michigan, standing is a prudential matter, and a plaintiff ca n
establish standing to sue in several independent ways.” Eagan v
Detroit, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “The most straightforward wa y
is when the plaintiff has an explicit ‘legal cause of action.’” Id. at ___,
quoting Lansing Sch Ed Ass’n v Lansing Bd of Ed, 487 Mich 349, 37 2
(2010). “Relatedly, if the plaintiff can meet the requirements for a
declaratory action under MCR 2.605, then that plaintiff will hav e
standing.” Eagan, ___ Mich App at ___. “If there is no cause of actio n
provided by law or MCR 2.605, then the plaintiff has to travel a mor e
circuitous (and less certain) route—to establish standing, the plaintif f
must show a special injury or right, or substantial interest, that will b e
detrimentally affected in a manner different from the citizenry a t
large.” Eagan, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-59
=== Page 140 ===
Section 2.15 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“‘[A]lthough the principle of statutory standing overlaps significantl y
with the real-party-in-interest rule, they are distinct concepts.’” Mak i
Estate v Coen, 318 Mich App 532, 539 n 1 (2017), quoting In re Beatrice
Rottenberg Living Trust, 300 Mich App 339, 355 (2013) (alteration i n
original). “The principle of statutory standing is jurisdictional; if a
party lacks statutory standing, then the court generally lack s
jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding or reach the merits.” In re
Beatrice Rottenberg Living Trust, 300 Mich App at 355. “In contrast, th e
real-party-in-interest rule is essentially a prudential limitation on a
litigant’s ability to raise the legal rights of another.” Id.
B. Real Party in Interest
Michigan’s “real party in interest jurisprudence is derived fro m
statutes and court rules.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich
Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025) (observing that “the purpose of the
real party in interest rule is to ensure that a defendant is not subject t o
multiple lawsuits after a judgment”). Legal actions must b e
prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. MCL 600.2041;
MCR 2.201(B). “Accordingly, a party may sue as the real party i n
interest if he can legally discharge the debtor and the satisfaction o f
judgment rendered will operate as such discharge, notwithstandin g
that the amount recovered may be for the benefit of another.” C-Spine,
___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“A real party in interest is one who is vested with the right of actio n
on a given claim, although the beneficial interest may be in another. ”
BCBSM v Eaton Raps Community Hosp, 221 Mich App 301, 311 (1997) .
See also MCL 600.2041 and MCR 2.201(B)(1). “The real-party-in-
interest rule recognizes that litigation should be begun only by a
party having an interest that will [ensure] sincere and vigorou s
advocacy.” Olin v Mercy Health Hackley Campus, 328 Mich App 337,
345 (2019) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “The rule als o
protects the defendant by ‘requiring that the claim be prosecuted b y
the party who by the substantive law in question owns the clai m
asserted’ against the defendant.’” Id. at 345, quoting In re Beatrice
Rottenberg Living Trust, 300 Mich App 339, 356 (2013). “[W]hen a
minor is negligently injured by another and sues through his or he r
next friend, the claim still belongs to the minor, and it is the mino r
who is the real party in interest.” Olin, 328 Mich App at 346.
MCR 2.201(C) governs an individual’s or an entity’s capacity to sue o r
be sued. “[T]he defense that a plaintiff is not the real party in interes t
is not the same as the legal-capacity-to-sue defense.” Olin, 328 Mic h
App at 355 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Where th e
individual is a minor or incompetent person, MCR 2.201(E) controls.
“Nothing in the plain language of MCR 2.201(E) requires the filing of
a petition for appointment or the completion of a next friend
Page 2-60 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 141 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.15
appointment before suit or simultaneously with the filing of a
complaint on behalf of a minor[.]” Olin, 328 Mich App at 349. MCR
2.201(E) “repeatedly refers to what ‘the court’ must do, clearly
implying that it is the court assigned to the minor’s lawsuit tha t
handles the next friend appointment process.” Olin, 328 Mich App a t
349. As such, “the court rule implicitly assumes the complaint ha s
already been filed, and properly so, even though no next friend ha s
yet been appointed.” Id. at 349. It is not required “that next-friend
appointments occur before commencing suit or before the expiratio n
of the statute of limitations period, even after a complaint has bee n
filed.” Id. at 356 (“the formal appointment of a next friend is [not] a
meaningful date for statute of limitation purposes,” and the trial cour t
erred in dismissing plaintiff’s medical malpractice action where th e
next friend was not appointed until after the expiration of the statut e
59
of limitations period).
Defect in real party in interest. Although “real party in interest statu s
is initially assessed at the time a complaint is filed,” a defect may “b e
remedied after filing.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___ (reiterating that “ a
party may cure a real party in interest defect”). “To be clear, failure t o
bring suit in the name of the real party in interest is a ground fo r
dismissal.” Id. at ___. See Woodley v Lancaster, 307 Mich 473, 478 (1943);
Heck v Henne, 238 Mich 198, 202 (1927). “However, it does no t
follow . . . that a suit originally filed in the name of someone other
than the real party in interest must necessarily be dismissed.” C-Spine,
___ Mich at ___ (observing that “a party with no right, title, or interes t
in the cause will be unable to prevail on the merits and, therefore, will
have little incentive to commence or continue litigation”) (quotatio n
marks omitted). “It is possible, in some circumstances, for a plaintif f
to cure this defect.” Id. at ___. For example, “where there is legal o r
factual uncertainty about who is a real party in interest or wher e
multiple parties have interests in different aspects of a case.” Id. at __ _
n 17 (recognizing rule “allow[ing] for defects of this nature to b e
corrected after the complaint is filed, much as pleading defects ma y
be corrected”).
“A plaintiff may not fix real party in interest defects by unilateral
actions taken outside of court . . . .” Id. at ___. “Instead, plaintiffs mus t
take some action in the litigation that would allow the court to asses s
the effect of the change in parties.” Id. at ___. “One possible proces s
would be to file an amended complaint joining or substituting th e
proper plaintiff.” Id. at ___. See MCR 2.202; MCR 2.205 through MCR
2.207. “A plaintiff can also file an amended complaint reflecting the
fact that they have become the real party in interest through a n
assignment.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___. See MCR 2.118; MCR
2.116(I)(5). “In all of these instances, the court will be able to consider

whether the correction of the real party in interest defect may relat e
back to when the original complaint was filed, or whether the suit will
be barred by the running of the statute of limitations or the one-year-
back rule—as well as any other obstacles that might arise.” C-Spine,
___ Mich at ___ (noting that “the equitable remedy of rescission als o
addresses this issue”). “If a prior assignment is rescinded, th e
assignor plaintiff may effectively become the real party in interest a t
the time the suit was filed.” Id. at ___.

2.16 Assignments
A. Generally
“‘An assignment of rights occurs when the assignor transfers his o r
her rights or interests to the assignee.’” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v
Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025), quoting Mecosta C o
Med Ctr v Metro Group Prop & Cas Ins Co, 509 Mich 276, 284 (2022).
“Unless in some way qualified, an assignment is properly the transfe r
of one’s whole interest in an estate, or chattel, or other thing.” C-Spine,
___ Mich at ___ (cleaned up) (observing “that an assignment entails a
transfer of rights to another”). “It is an ‘absolute’ transfer of the clai m
at issue, that extinguishes the assignor’s rights.” Id. at ___ (cleane d
up). “Indeed, this feature is what separates assignments from othe r
legal transfers of claims or benefits.” Id. at ___. “If the transfer is less
than absolute, it is not an assignment.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
“Michigan courts have long recognized that a plaintiff who assigns a
claim cannot then bring suit to collect on that claim as that plaintiff i s
no longer the real party in interest.” Id. at ___. See Woodley v Lancaster,
307 Mich 473, 478 (1943); Heck v Henne, 238 Mich 198, 202 (1927). “Thi s
is because an assignment is a transfer of the assignor’s whole interes t
in its subject matter.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). However, “it is perfectly acceptable to assign a
claim for the purposes of collection if a judgment obtained by th e
assignee will discharge the defendant from their obligation to th e
assignor.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, “where an assignment is such tha t
satisfaction of the judgment obtained by the assignee will discharg e
the defendant from his obligation to the assignor, for the purpose o f
the suit the assignee is the real party in interest and may maintain a n

action in his own name.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
B. Partial Assignments
“Though an assignment is absolute with respect to the rights assigned
away, there is flexibility in the scope of what is assigned.” C-Spine
Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025).
Accordingly, “an assignor may choose to assign away only part of
their claim.” Id. at ___. “An assignment of a part of a right, whethe r
the part is specified as a fraction, as an amount, or otherwise, i s
operative as to that part to the same extent and in the same manner a s
if the part had been a separate right.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up); see also
Schwartz v Tuchman, 232 Mich 345, 349-350 (1925). “Indeed, suc h
partial assignments are ubiquitous in no-fault cases because the ac t
contemplates and requires a multitude of performances (i.e.,
payments) by the insurer, which are often assigned to the provider s
who performed the relevant services.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___.
“Additionally, it has long been the law in Michigan that a claim ma y
be assigned for the purposes of collection, allowing the assignee t o
litigate the claim and reserving to the assignor the right to proceed s
recovered.” Id. at ___. “A plaintiff who has assigned away their clai m
is not the real party in interest.” Id. at ___. “However, defects in real
party in interest status are not necessarily fatal to a lawsuit.” Id. a t
___. “The plaintiff may fix such a problem by joining or substitutin g
the proper party, amending their complaint, seeking and obtainin g
the equitable remedy of rescission, or taking other actions durin g
litigation to cure a real party in interest defect.” Id. at ___.
C. Counter-Assignments
A counter-assignment may refer to an agreement “in which a n
assignee transfers a claim back to the original assignor.” C-Spine
Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ n 4
(2025). In C-Spine, “the counter-assignments from the factoring
companies back to [the medical provider] and ‘amendments o f
agreements’ allowed [the medical provider] to sue as the real party i n
interest.” Id. at ___ (noting “these documents made [the medical
provider] the real party in interest again, by either transferring claim s
to it or by clarifying that it always had the power to collect on thes e
claims on behalf of the factoring companies”). The medical provider’ s
“counter-assignments were effective in returning its real party i n
interest status—though it did not take action in the trial court, such a s
amending its complaints to reflect the counter-assignments, tha t
would have allowed the trial court to consider the effect of thi s
change.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the ‘counter-assignments’ returned
[the medical provider’s] real party in interest status—though they di d

=== Page 144 ===
Section 2.17 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
not alone cure the real party in interest defect”). Indeed, the medical
provider “needed to file amended complaints reflecting the counter-
assignments or take some other action that would have allowed th e
trial court to consider their effect.” Id. at ___.
2.17 Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel
The concepts of res judicata (also known as claim preclusion) and
collateral estoppel (also known as issue preclusion) are designed t o
prevent the relitigation of claims that have already been litigated or tha t
should have been litigated in a prior case. See, generally, Mable Clear y
Trust v Edward-Marlah Muzyl Trust, 262 Mich App 485 (2004), overruled
60
on other grounds by Titan Ins Co v Hyten, 491 Mich 547, 556 n 4 (2012).
Although the terms res judicata and collateral estoppel are ofte n
conflated, Topps-Toeller, Inc v Lansing, 47 Mich App 720, 726 (1973),
distinguished the two doctrines:
• Res judicata “bars the reinstitution of the same cause of
action by the same parties in a subsequent suit.” Topps-
Toeller, Inc, 47 Mich App at 727.
• Collateral estoppel “bars the relitigation of issue s
previously decided when such issues are raised in a
subsequent suit by the same parties based upon a differen t
cause of action.” Topps-Toeller, Inc, 47 Mich App at 727.
The above “two principles fulfill the judicial policy of providing th e
parties with a final decision upon litigated questions.” Topps-Toeller, Inc,
47 Mich App at 727.
A. Res Judicata
1. Prerequisites
“Res judicata bars a second action on the same claim if (1) the
prior action was decided on the merits, (2) both actions involve
the same parties or their privies, and (3) the matter in the second
case was, or could have been, resolved in the first.” Farmers Ins
Exch v Hudson Ins Co, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotatio n
marks and citations omitted). “Michigan courts use a
transactional test to determine if the matter could have bee n
resolved in the prior case.” Id. at ___. “The transactional tes t
provides that the assertion of different kinds or theories of relief
still constitutes a single cause of action if a single group of

note.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.17
operative facts give rise to the assertion of relief.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Whether a factual
grouping constitutes a transaction for purposes of res judicata i s
to be determined pragmatically, by considering whether the fact s
are related in time, space, origin or motivation, and whether they
form a convenient trial unit.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
“To be accorded the conclusive effect of res judicata, the
judgment must ordinarily be a firm and stable one, the last word
of the rendering court.” In re Bibi Guardianship, 315 Mich Ap p
323, 333 (2016) (explaining that orders granting temporary relief
and interlocutory orders generally do not carry preclusive effec t
under res judicata) (quotation marks, alterations, and citatio n
omitted).
“To be in privity is to be so identified in interest with another
party that the first litigant represents the same legal right tha t
the later litigant is trying to assert.” Farmers, ___ Mich App at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Generally, a
relationship based on an assignment of rights is deemed to be
one of privity.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“An assignment of rights occurs when the assignor transfers hi s
or her rights or interests to the assignee.” Id. at ___ (quotation
marks and citation omitted). “In these circumstances, the
assignee succeeds to the rights of the assignor, thus meeting the
general definition of privity.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). “But the mere succession of rights to the same
property or interest does not, by itself, give rise to privity wit h
regard to subsequent actions by and against the assignor.” Id. a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Privity does no t
arise from the mere fact that persons as litigants are interested i n
the same question or in proving or disproving the same state of
facts.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Rather,
the binding effect of the adjudication flows from the fact tha t
when the successor acquires an interest in the right it is the n
affected by the adjudication in the hands of the former owner.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “In other words, the assignee succeeds t o
those rights subject to any earlier adjudication involving the
assignor that defined those rights.” Id. at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted).
A party may not unilaterally elect to present only a portion of it s
case at trial and, at the same time, reserve its right to litigate the
remaining portion at a separate proceeding in the future.
“Unlike collateral estoppel, which bars relitigation of only those
issues actually decided, res judicata bars relitigation of
claims . . . actually litigated and those claims arising out of the
same transaction that could have been litigated, but were not.”
Hofmann v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 211 Mich App 55, 92 (1995).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-65
=== Page 146 ===
Section 2.17 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2. Burden of Proof
The burden of proving the application of res judicata is on the
party asserting it. Baraga Co v State Tax Comm, 466 Mich 264, 26 9
(2002).
3. Timing
The defense of res judicata must be raised in the party’s firs t
responsive pleading, unless the defense is stated in a motio n
filed under MCR 2.116 before the party’s first responsive
pleading. MCR 2.116(D)(2). However, “MCR 2.116(D)(2) doe s
not foreclose a party from adding a defense in an amended
responsive pleading.” Leite v Dow Chem Co, 439 Mich 920 (1992).
4. Res Judicata Asserted by Plaintiff
A plaintiff may assert res judicata as a ground for judgmen t
against a defendant. Marketplace of Rochester Hills Parcel B, LLC v
Comerica Bank, 309 Mich App 579, 588-589 (2015), vacated in par t
61
on other grounds 498 Mich 934 (2015). Although “[p]artie s
typically use the doctrine of res judicata as a shield rather than a s
a sword, . . . nothing precludes a plaintiff from asserting re s
judicata as a ground for judgment if the plaintiff has asserted a
ripe claim.” Id. (holding that the trial court erred by
“determining that res judicata is a defense that . . . only [a
defendant may] assert in a successive action against it by [a
plaintiff]”) (citations omitted).
5. Federal Case as Basis for Res Judicata
The Michigan Supreme Court requires the application of federal
law to res judicata claims when determining whether the prior
federal suit bars the state action under the doctrine. Pierson San d
& Gravel, Inc v Keeler Brass Co, 460 Mich 372, 380-381 (1999). Th e
federal law on determining whether the doctrine of res judicata
applies can be found at Becherer v Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, &
Smith, Inc, 193 F3d 415, 422 (CA 6, 1999). The elements includ e
the three prerequisites that Michigan analyzes in addition to “a n
identity of the causes of action.” Id. at 422.
61For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Page 2-66 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 147 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.17
6. Application of Res Judicata
a. Consent Judgment
The doctrine of res judicata applies to consent judgments.
In re Bibi Guardianship, 315 Mich App 323, 333 (2016) .
However, the consent judgment must be “a final decisio n
for purposes of res judicata.” Id. Accordingly, res judicat a
did not bar a guardianship petition where a prior foreig n
consent judgment “was clearly not intended to be the las t
word of the [foreign] court with regard to the wards,” bu t
rather was merely “an agreement between the partie s
regarding a temporary placement . . . [pending] ‘further
Order of the Court.’” Id. at 334. Furthermore, wher e
“[m]ore than a year passed between the entry of the
consent judgment and the probate court’s decision,
during which there were intervening changes of both fac t
and law,” and “the proper venue for a guardianship or
custody [action] changed from [the foreign jurisdiction] t o
Michigan,” the probate court erred in applying re s
judicata, which resulted in an “abdicat[ion of] it s
statutory authority to decide the issue on the merits[.]” Id.
at 334, 335 (citations omitted).
b. Involuntary Dismissal
Because an involuntary dismissal operates as a n
adjudication on the merits under MCR 2.504(B)(3), re s
judicata barred a successor personal representative of a
decedent’s estate from filing a complaint after the initial
personal representative’s complaint was dismissed
because the statute of limitations had expired. Washingto n
v Sinai Hosp of Greater Detroit, 478 Mich 412, 414 (2007).
See also Adair v Michigan (Adair III), 317 Mich App 355,
365 (2016) (holding that “[a]n involuntary dismissal
pursuant to MCR 2.504 operates as an adjudication on the
merits,” and “in the absence of any language in the order
of dismissal limiting the scope of the merits decided,” the
first prerequisite to applying res judicata – that the prior
action be decided on the merits – is satisfied by a n
involuntary dismissal).
Note: MCR 2.504(B)(3) states that “[u]nles s
the court otherwise specifies in its order fo r
dismissal, a dismissal under this subrule or a
dismissal not provided for in this rule, othe r
than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or fo r
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-67
=== Page 148 ===
Section 2.17 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
failure to join a party under MCR 2.205,
operates as an adjudication on the merits.”
c. Workers’ Compensation
“The doctrine of res judicata applies to workers’
compensation awards[.]” Banks v LAB Lansing Bod y
Assembly, 271 Mich App 227, 229-230 (2006). “However, a
claimant may later raise a different claim or modify a n
existing award if the employee’s physical conditio n
worsens.” Id. at 230.
d. The Headlee Amendment
The doctrine of res judicata applies to matters involving
the enforcement of the Headlee Amendment, Const 1963 ,
art 9, §§ 25-34. Adair v Michigan (Adair III), 317 Mich Ap p
355, 364 n 3 (2016) (“the ratifiers of the Headlee
Amendment ‘would have thought, as with all litigation,
there would be the traditional rules that would preclude
relitigation of similar issues by similar parties’ and that a n
application of the doctrine was essential to making the
amendment ‘workable,’ and to preventing the
Amendment from becoming a ‘Frankensteinia n
monster’”), quoting Adair v Michigan (Adair II), 470 Mich
105, 120-121, 126-127 (2004).
e. Landlord-Tenant Summary Proceedings
“The remedy provided by summary proceedings is i n
addition to, and not exclusive of, other remedies, either
legal, equitable or statutory.” MCL 600.5750. Accordingly,
the application of res judicata in the context of a judgmen t
of possession is limited to claims that were actually
litigated. Sewell v Clean Cut Mgt, Inc, 463 Mich 569, 576-
577 (2001). “Interpreting this provision, our Supreme
Court has concluded that, ‘the Legislature took thes e
cases outside the realm of the normal rules concerning
merger and bar in order that attorneys would not be
obliged to fasten all other pending claims to the swiftly
moving summary proceedings.’” King v Munro, 329 Mic h
App 594, 602 (2019), quoting Sewell, 463 Mich at 574
(concluding that “because plaintiff was not required t o
bring her negligence claim in the summary-evictio n
proceedings and the district court did not otherwise
resolve the claim, res judicata [did] not bar plaintiff fro m
bringing a negligence claim in the circuit court”).
Page 2-68 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 149 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.17
f. Personal Protection Order
Res judicata did not bar a petitioner’s second request for a
PPO where the petitioner accused the respondent of som e
of the same stalking behaviors she identified in her firs t
request for a PPO. See PF v JF, 336 Mich App 118, 120-121
(2021). In PF, the petitioner sought the first PPO based on
five incidents, and the trial court denied the request. Id. a t
120. After the court denied the request, a sixth inciden t
occurred, and it “drove petitioner to again seek th e
assistance of a [different] court in an effort to obtain a
PPO against respondent. And the sixth incident could no t
be viewed in isolation or a vacuum; rather, the pattern of
conduct between and involving the parties, including the
first five incidents, had to be examined in its entirety. The
earlier incidents could give explanation or context to the
sixth incident by providing insight on intent, continuity
of purpose, the reasonableness of beliefs, and states of
mind or feelings relative to terror, fright, intimidation,
threats, harassment, and molestation.” Id. at 129-130 (the
Court recognized that the incidents raised in the firs t
request overlapped with all but one incident raised in the
second request, but noted that if “res judicata precluded
consideration of the first five incidents in relation t o
whether a PPO should be issued predicated on stalking
activity,” the Court “would effectively be subverting th e
intent of the Legislature in enacting MCL 600.2950” an d
“the common-law doctrine of res judicata cannot be
employed to undermine our Legislature’s intent”). “ A
circuit court needs to have the ability to examine and
consider the totality of the circumstances when ruling o n
a PPO petition. The past history of the parties is a
necessary consideration when evaluating whether a PP O
should be issued.” PF, 336 Mich App at 130-131.
g. Assignments
Because “both res judicata and collateral estoppel appl y
only when the parties in the subsequent action wer e
parties or privies of parties to the original action,” “a
judgment entered after [an] assignment does not bind the
assignee [when] the assignee is not in privity with th e
assignor with respect to that judgment.” Mecosta Co Med
Ctr v Metro Group Prop & Cas Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___
(2022). In Mecosta, the insured “was injured in a car cras h
and received medical treatment from plaintiffs[.]” Id. at
___. “As compensation for this treatment,” the insured
assigned plaintiffs “his right to seek no-fault personal
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-69
=== Page 150 ===
Section 2.17 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
protection insurance (PIP) benefits from the insure r
responsible for making those payments.” Id. at ___. “Afte r
the assignment,” the insured “filed suit seeking PI P
benefits for separate services he received arising from the
crash.” Id. at ___. “In that lawsuit, to which [the Mecost a
plaintiffs] were not party, the trial court held that [th e
insured] had not properly insured the vehicle and wa s
therefore not entitled to any benefits.” Id. at ___.
The Michigan Supreme Court held that “the doctrines o f
res judicata and collateral estoppel [were] inapplicable”
“because plaintiffs were neither parties to the earlier sui t
nor privies with respect to the subsequently entered
judgment[.]” Mecosta Co Med Ctr, ___ Mich at ___. Th e
Mecosta Court noted that “the mere succession of rights t o
the same property or interest does not, by itself, give rise
to privity with regard to subsequent actions by and
against the assignor.” Id. at ___. The Court observed that
“the assignee succeeds to those rights subject to any
earlier adjudication involving the assignor that defined
those rights.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the Court opine d
that “[w]hen the litigation involving the assignor occur s
after the assignment, the rights could not yet have bee n
affected by the litigation at the time they were transferred
to the assignee.” Id. at ___.
“The fact that the prior judgment involved rescission doe s
not alter the analysis under Mecosta.” C-Spine Orthopedics,
PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, 346 Mich App 197, 208
(2023). Accordingly, “[t]he fact that the court in [th e
injured party’s] case granted the equitable remedy of
rescission does not affect [assignee] C-Spine’s rights,
because C-Spine was not involved in that case. It had n o
opportunity to argue against rescission in that litigation.
A contrary position would allow an assignor to cut off a n
assignee’s rights without the latter having any notice or
opportunity to be heard.” Id. at 210. “Rescission does no t
change this.” Id. at 210.
B. Collateral Estoppel
1. Prerequisites
“Collateral estoppel bars relitigation of an issue in a new action.”
Hamood v Trinity Health Corp, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Generally, collateral
estoppel can be invoked when three elements are met: (1) a
question of fact essential to the judgment must have bee n
Page 2-70 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 151 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.17
actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment;
(2) the same parties must have had a full and fair opportunity t o
litigate the issue; and (3) there must be mutuality of estoppel.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “In determining whether a party wa s
given a full and fair opportunity to litigate an issue, a
subsequent action is not precluded if the issue is one of law and
the two actions involve claims that are substantially unrelated.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “A judgment is considered a
determination of the merits, and thereby triggers the doctrine of
collateral estoppel on relitigation, even if the action has bee n
resolved by summary disposition . . . .” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Collateral estoppel is strictly
applied in that the issues in both cases must be identical, and no t
merely similar.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
“One of the critical factors in applying collateral estoppel
involves the determination of whether the respective litigant s
were parties or privy to a party to an action in which a valid
judgment has been rendered.” Synergy Spine & Orthopedi c
Surgery Ctr, LLC v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2024) (cleaned up) (“[C]ollateral estoppel appl[ies] only
when the parties in the subsequent action were parties or privie s
of parties to the original action.”). “[A]n assignee is in privit y
with the assignor only up to the time of the assignment and no t
thereafter.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the doctrine of collatera l
estoppel does not preclude a plaintiff’s claim where the “plaintiff
was neither a party in [the insured’s] case nor in privity with [the
insured] with respect to the judgment that was entered after th e
assignment.” Id. at ___ (rejecting alternative basis for trial court’ s
ruling that “plaintiff’s claim [was] ‘derivative’ of [the insured’s],
and thus, precluded by the judgment in [the insured’s] lawsuit.”)
2. Mutuality of Estoppel
To satisfy mutuality of estoppel, the party attempting to estop
the other party from relitigating an issue must have been a party
or in privy to a party in the previous action. Monat v State Farm
Ins Co, 469 Mich 679, 684 (2004). “A party is one who was directl y
interested in the subject matter and had a right to defend or t o
control the proceedings and to appeal from the judgment, while
a privy is one who, after the judgment, has an interest in the
matter affected by the judgment through one of the parties, as by
inheritance, succession, or purchase.” Rental Props Owners Ass’n
of Kent Co v Kent Co Treasurer, 308 Mich App 498, 529-530 (2014).
Estoppel is mutual if the party asserting estoppel would have
been bound by the earlier adjudication if it had gone agains t
them. Monat, 469 Mich at 684-685. However, “the lack of
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-71
=== Page 152 ===
Section 2.17 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
mutuality of estoppel should not preclude the use of collateral
estoppel when it is asserted defensively to prevent a party fro m
relitigating an issue that such party has already had a full and
fair opportunity to litigate in a prior suit.” Id. at 691-692.
“Mutuality of estoppel occurs when the one taking advantage of
the earlier adjudication would have been bound by it, had i t
gone against him.” Hamood v Trinity Health Corp, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Bu t
mutuality of estoppel is not mandatory in every situation.” Id. a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Whenever
collateral estoppel is being asserted defensively against a party
who has already had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the
issue, mutuality is not required.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “Allowing the defensive use of collateral
estoppel even when mutuality does not exist enhances the
efficient administration of justice and ensures more consisten t
judicial decisions.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). In Hamood, the Cour t
of Appeals held that when a federal court ruled “that plaintiff
did not provide notice of the sexual harassment until after her
employment had ended,” the court had “decided a question of
fact by a valid and final judgment, and plaintiff had a full and
fair opportunity to litigate the issue.” Id. at ___. “It [did] no t
matter that the federal court made that finding in the context of
the federal claim against [a co-defendant], and not [defendant],
because mutuality of estoppel [was] not required in thi s
situation.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, summary disposition wa s
appropriate under MCR 2.116(C)(7) because “plaintiff wa s
collaterally estopped from arguing the notice element of her
hostile work environment claim.” Hamood, ___ Mich at ___.
In the context of “the defensive use of collateral estoppel, [a
plaintiff] is relieved from the mutuality requirement if
defendant already had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the
issues.” Synergy Spine & Orthopedic Surgery Ctr, LLC v State Far m
Mut Auto Ins Co, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). In Synergy Spine,
the Court of Appeals determined that “defendant had a full and
fair opportunity to litigate” whether the insured “suffered a
bodily injury from the [subject] accident, from which allowable
expenses were incurred,” and thus, “collateral estoppel [bound]
defendant to the jury findings.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the trial
court erred in not granting plaintiff’s request to narrow the
issues” accordingly). The Court reasoned that “(1) the tw o
actions [were] closely related; (2) no factual, law, or procedural
changes merit[ed] a new determination; (3) because plaintiff’ s
suit was filed before [the insured’s] and ongoing at the time of
the [insured’s] trial, it was foreseeable these issues would arise i n
the instant case; and (4) because these fundamental issue s
Page 2-72 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 153 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.17
establish the potential for defendant’s liability for expense s
related to the accident, defendant had an incentive to obtain a
full and fair adjudication of the issues during the [insured’s]
trial.” Id. at ___. However, the Court rejected plaintiff’ s
contention “this application of collateral estoppel reduces the
issues for litigation to what is a reasonable and customary fee for
its services” because the insured’s “jury’s finding that [the
insured] sustained an accidental bodily injury arising from th e
accident and that allowable expenses were incurred does no t
speak to the issue whether the specific benefits sought by
plaintiff here were ‘allowable expenses.’” Id. at ___. “More
particularly, the jury’s finding did not specifically address the
issue whether the benefits sought by plaintiff were for the
accidental bodily injury—that the requisite causal connectio n
existed such that PIP benefits were payable for the medical
services rendered by plaintiff. That [the insured] incurred
allowable expenses does not mean that every medical expense
incurred is for the . . . bodily injury caused by the accident.” Id.
at ___. Consequently, the Court held that “the proper narrowing
of issues under collateral estoppel [did] not include that the
requisite causal connection existed between [the insured’s]
accidental bodily injury and plaintiff’s fees for use of its facility;
rather, that [was] for plaintiff to prove.” Id. at ___.
3. Crossover Estoppel
Crossover estoppel, which precludes a party from raising a n
issue in a civil proceeding after it has been raised in a criminal
proceeding, and vice versa, is permissible. People v Gates, 43 4
Mich 146, 155-157 (1990); Barrow v Pritchard, 235 Mich App 478,
481 (1999). For example, crossover estoppel precludes a
complainant from raising a legal malpractice claim in a civil
forum after raising and failing to establish an ineffective
assistance of counsel claim in a criminal forum against the same
attorney. Id. at 483-485. However, the Michigan Supreme Cour t
stated that it “must hesitate to apply collateral estoppel in the
reverse situation—when the government seeks to apply
collateral estoppel to preclude a criminal defendant’s claim o f
ineffective assistance of counsel in light of a prior civil judgment
that defense counsel did not commit malpractice.” People v
Trakhtenberg, 493 Mich 38, 48 (2012). In Trakhtenberg, the Court
determined that collateral estoppel could not be applied t o
preclude review of the criminal defendant’s claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel when a prior civil judgment held tha t
defense counsel’s performance did not amount to malpractice,
because it did not provide the defendant a full and fair
opportunity to litigate the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
Id. at 50-51. Indeed, “collateral estoppel ‘must be applied so as t o

=== Page 154 ===
Section 2.17 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
strike a balance between the need to eliminate repetitious and
needless litigation and the interest in affording litigants a full and
fair adjudication of the issues involved in their claims.’” Id. at 50,
quoting Storey v Meijer, Inc, 431 Mich 368, 372 (1988). See th e
Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criminal Proceedings Benchbook Vol. 1,
Chapter 9, for additional information on civil-to-criminal cross-
over estoppel.
4. On Remand
“[C]ollateral estoppel may arise within the confines of a single
cause of action.” Law Offices of Jeffrey Sherbow, PC v Fieger &
Fieger, PC, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023). “[W]hen a case i s
remanded for a new trial, the trial court may consider and gran t
a motion for summary disposition if the requirements for
granting such a motion are satisfied.” Id. at ___. Additionally,
“when a case is remanded, the lower court is free to consider and
decide any matters left open by the appellate court’s mandate.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
5. Application of Collateral Estoppel
“A question has not been actually litigated until put into issue by
the pleadings, submitted to the trier of fact for determination,
and thereafter determined.” VanDeventer v Mich Nat’l Bank, 172
Mich 456, 463 (1988), citing Cogan v Cogan, 149 Mich App 375,
379 (1986).
a. Consent Judgment
Older Court of Appeals cases have concluded tha t
collateral estoppel does not apply to consent judgment s
because “‘[n]othing is adjudicated between two parties t o
a consent judgment.’” Van Pembrook v Zero Mfg Co, 146
Mich App 87, 102-103 (1985), quoting American Mu t
Liability Ins Co v Mich Mut Liability Co, 64 Mich App 315,
327 (1975). But a more recent opinion, In re Bib i
Guardianship, 315 Mich App 323, 332 (2016), states tha t
“collateral estoppel does not apply to consent judgment s
where factual issues are neither tried nor conceded.”
(Quotation marks and citation omitted.) Where “the
factual issues involved in [a] prior [foreign child
protective] proceeding were [not] actually tried or
conceded by entry of [a] consent judgment . . . [that] wa s
merely an agreement between the parties regarding a
temporary placement for the wards,” and collateral
estoppel did not bar a Michigan guardianshi p
proceeding. Id. at 332.
Page 2-74 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 155 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.17
b. Dismissal/Affirmative Defense
Collateral estoppel does not apply to an issue raised as a n
affirmative defense in a prior action that was dismissed
upon stipulation of the parties where the issue “was no t
one of the essential questions actually litigated in the
prior case and . . . was not resolved by the judgment. ”
King v Munro, 329 Mich App 594, 599 (2019) (the issue
“was not mentioned at the hearing to dismiss the case and
[was] not mentioned in the order”; additionally, “the
dismissal [did] not hinge on the [issue]”).
c. Arbitration Proceeding
“[T]he trial court did not err when it denied [the
plaintiff’s] motion to vacate [an] arbitration award on the
basis of collateral estoppel.” Radwan v Ameriprise Ins Co,
327 Mich App 159, 173 (2019). Where the issue of th e
plaintiff’s “injury was actually tried and incorporated int o
[a] stipulated order of dismissal” during the plaintiff’ s
third-party action, a question of fact essential to the
plaintiff’s claim for first-party benefits had been litigated
and determined by a valid and final judgment. Id. at 171.
“[T]he stipulated order of dismissal, which incorporated
the jury’s verdict [that the plaintiff had not suffered a n
injury, was] sufficient to satisfy the first requirement for
collateral estoppel.” Id. at 168 (“even if the stipulated
order of dismissal was a consent judgment, collateral
62
estoppel applies in this case” ). Additionally, although
the plaintiff “made the tactical decision to relinquish he r
opportunity to appeal [the jury’s verdict] in consideratio n
for [the defendant’s] agreement to forgo case evaluatio n
sanctions” that decision did not prevent her fro m
receiving “a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue
of her injuries.” Id. at 173. Lastly, mutuality was no t
required because “‘collateral estoppel [was] being
asserted defensively against [the plaintiff] who [had]
already had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the
issue[.]’” Id. at 166, quoting Monat v State Farm Ins Co, 46 9
63
Mich 679, 680-681, 695 (2004).
62See Section Section 2.15(B)(4)(a) for additional discussion of collateral estoppel and consent judgments.
63See Section 2.15(B)(2) for additional discussion of mutuality.

Section 2.17 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
d. Administrative Proceeding
“Collateral estoppel applies to administrative
proceedings if the determination was adjudicatory i n
nature, allowed for an appeal, and the Legislature
intended that the decision would be final if no appeal wa s
taken.” Holton v Ward, 303 Mich App 718, 731-732 (2014) .
“An administrative agency’s decision is conclusive of the
rights of the parties, or their privies, in all other actions or
suits in the same or any other tribunal of concurren t
jurisdiction on the points and matters in issue in the firs t
proceeding.” Id. at 732 (internal citations and quotations
omitted).
e. Assignments
Because “both res judicata and collateral estoppel apply
only when the parties in the subsequent action were
parties or privies of parties to the original action,” “a
judgment entered after [an] assignment does not bind the
assignee [when] the assignee is not in privity with the
assignor with respect to that judgment[.]” Mecosta Co Me d
Ctr v Metro Group Prop & Cas Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___
(2022). In Mecosta, the insured “was injured in a car cras h
and received medical treatment from plaintiffs[.]” Id. at
___. “As compensation for this treatment,” the insured
assigned plaintiffs “his right to seek no-fault personal
protection insurance (PIP) benefits from the insurer
responsible for making those payments.” Id. at ___. “Afte r
the assignment,” the insured “filed suit seeking PI P
benefits for separate services he received arising from the
crash.” Id. at ___. “In that lawsuit, to which [the Mecost a
plaintiffs] were not party, the trial court held that [th e
insured] had not properly insured the vehicle and wa s
therefore not entitled to any benefits.” Id. at ___.
The Michigan Supreme Court held that “the doctrines of
res judicata and collateral estoppel [were] inapplicable”
“because plaintiffs were neither parties to the earlier sui t
nor privies with respect to the subsequently entered
judgment.” Mecosta Co Med Ctr, ___ Mich at ___. Th e
Mecosta Court noted that “the mere succession of rights t o
the same property or interest does not, by itself, give rise
to privity with regard to subsequent actions by and
against the assignor.” Id. at ___. The Court observed that
“the assignee succeeds to those rights subject to any
earlier adjudication involving the assignor that defined
those rights.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the Court opined
Page 2-76 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 157 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.17
that “[w]hen the litigation involving the assignor occur s
after the assignment, the rights could not yet have bee n
affected by the litigation at the time they were transferred
to the assignee.” Id. at ___.
“The fact that the prior judgment involved rescission doe s
not alter the analysis under Mecosta.” C-Spine Orthopedics,
PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, 346 Mich App 197, 20 8
(2023). Accordingly, “[t]he fact that the court in [the
injured party’s] case granted the equitable remedy of
rescission does not affect [assignee] C-Spine’s rights,
because C-Spine was not involved in that case. It had n o
opportunity to argue against rescission in that litigation.
A contrary position would allow an assignor to cut off a n
assignee’s rights without the latter having any notice or
opportunity to be heard.” Id. at 210. “Rescission does no t
change this.” Id. at 210.
f. Government Employee Advice
“Not everything a government worker tells you binds the
government.” Meier v Pub Sch Employees’ Retirement Sys,
343 Mich App 571, 574 (2022). The United States Supreme
Court has “rejected an estoppel-based argument tha t
erroneous oral and written advice given by a Governmen t
employee to a benefits claimant bound the federal
government to provide benefits to the claimant.” Id. at 58 1
(quotation marks and citation omitted). The Michiga n
Supreme Court “similarly has taken an extraordinarily
narrow view of estoppel against the government, ruling
that, although it is unfortunate that plaintiff received
incorrect guidance, such guidance cannot alter the law of
this state.” Id. at 581 (cleaned up). “There cannot be as
many laws as there are public servants who dispense
guidance or advice on the meaning of the law. Rather,
such guidance or advice must always be understood a s
subordinate to the law actually enacted by the elected
representatives of the people.” Id. at 581 (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). Accordingly, a statute “must be
faithfully applied” “even if plaintiff received advice fro m
[a government] employee that contradicted the language
of the [act].” Id. at 582.
C. Standard of Review
The application of res judicata or collateral estoppel is a question of
law that is reviewed de novo. In re Bibi Guardianship, 315 Mich App
323, 328 (2016)..
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-77

Section 2.18 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2.18 Law of the Case
“The law of the case doctrine holds that a ruling by an appellate court o n
a particular issue binds the appellate court and all lower tribunals wit h
respect to that issue. Thus, a question of law decided by an appellat e
court will not be decided differently on remand or in a subsequen t
appeal in the same case.” Ashker v Ford Motor Co, 245 Mich App 9, 1 3
64
(2001) (internal citation omitted). See also Zaremba Equip, Inc v Harc o
Nat’l Ins Co, 302 Mich App 7, 16 (2013), quoting CAF Investment Co v
Saginaw Twp, 410 Mich 428, 454 (1981) (“‘if an appellate court has passe d
on a legal question and remanded the case for further proceedings, th e
legal questions thus determined by the appellate court will not b e
differently determined on a subsequent appeal in the same case wher e
the facts remain materially the same’”). “The law-of-the-case doctrin e
applies ‘only to issues actually decided, either implicitly or explicitly, i n
the prior appeal.’” Farmers Ins Exch v Hudson Ins Co, ___ Mich App ___ ,
___ (2025), quoting Grievance Admin v Lopatin, 462 Mich 235, 260 (2000).
“Trial courts are bound by the doctrine unless there has been a materia l
change in the facts or an intervening change in the law.” Pioneer State Mut
Ins Co v Wright, 331 Mich App 396, 407 (2020). “A trial court violates the
law-of-the-case doctrine when it revisits a legal issue already ruled on b y
[a higher court].” Id.
“The primary purpose of the doctrine is to maintain consistency and
avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a
single continuing lawsuit.” Ashker, 245 Mich App at 13. Law of the case
accords “finality to the litigated issues until the cause of action is full y
litigated, including retrials or appeals, and the superseding doctrines o f
res judicata and collateral estoppel become effective.” Topps-Toeller, Inc v
Lansing, 47 Mich App 720, 729 (1973).
“The law-of-the-case doctrine is a judicially created, self-imposed
restraint designed to promote consistency throughout the life of a
lawsuit.” Great Lakes Eye Institute, PC v Krebs, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “The law-of-the-case doctrin e
merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen wha t
has been decided, not a limit to their power.” Id. at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). “The application of the doctrine is limited to legal
questions and requires that underlying facts remain materially th e
same.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Further, where new evidence i s
presented, the law-of-the-case doctrine does not preclude a trial court o n
remand from revisiting a factual question underlying a legal
determination.” Id. at ___ (holding that “the law-of-the-case doctrine
prevented the lower courts from revisiting the judgment that wa s
granted in defendant’s favor,” but “did not preclude the trial court fro m

considering newly introduced evidence to determine the appropriat e
attorney fee award” “[b]ecause neither the trial court nor the Court o f
Appeals had previously made an attorney fee determination”).
“[C]ourts have some discretion when applying the law-of-the-cas e
doctrine under certain circumstances.” Ingham Co v Mich Co Rd Comm
Self-Ins Pool (On Remand), 329 Mich App 295, 304 (2019), rev’d on other
65
grounds 508 Mich 461 (2021). See, e.g., Locricchio v Evening News Ass’n,
438 Mich 84, 109-110 (1991) (noting that there are instances where “th e
law of the case doctrine must yield to a competing doctrine”); People v
Robinson (After Second Remand), 227 Mich App 28, 34 (1997) (“declin[ing]
to apply a doctrine designed for judicial convenience in fairl y
administering the obligation to do justice so as to work an injustice”).
“[T]he doctrine does not preclude reconsideration of a question if ther e
has been an intervening change of law. For this exception to apply, th e
change of law must occur after the initial decision of the appellate court. ”
Ashker, 245 Mich App at 13 (internal citation omitted).
“[T]he law-of-the-case doctrine [does] not apply to claims that were no t
decided on the merits[.]” Brownlow v McCall Enterprises, Inc, 315 Mich
App 103, 112 (2016). Therefore, “the law of the case doctrine does no t
apply [to] prior orders denying leave to appeal [that] were not rulings o n
the merits of the issues presented.” People v Poole, 497 Mich 1022, 102 2
(2015). Additionally, “‘[w]here an order of summary judgment i s
reversed and the case is returned for trial because an issue of material fac t
exists, the law of the case doctrine does not apply to the second appeal
because the first appeal was not decided on the merits.’” Brownlow, 31 5
Mich App at 112, quoting Borkus v Mich Nat’l Bank, 117 Mich App 662,
666 (1982) (alteration in original). However, “application of the law-of-
the-case doctrine [is not automatically barred] whenever there is a gran t
of summary disposition based on the presence of factual questions[.] ”
Brownlow, 315 Mich App at 113, 118 (holding that where the Court o f
Appeals “previously ruled [that] there was sufficient evidence o f
causation to go to a jury,” “the law-of-the-case doctrine applie[d] to th e
issue of causation,” and “[t]he trial court [on remand] erred by holdin g
that defendant could seek summary disposition regarding causation” )
(citations omitted).
The “doctrine should not be invoked to preclude appellate review of a
contested question of law that was presumed but not decided against a
party in an interlocutory appeal if doing so would deprive the party o f
their right to appeal an unfavorable trial court decision on that issue, ”
because “the goal of promoting consistency in judgments would not b e
furthered by application” of the doctrine under such circumstances. Rott

v Rott, 508 Mich 274, 288, 288 n 1 (2021) (noting the “ruling should not b e
read as requiring judicial review of an issue that a party waived o r
conceded before filing its appeal by right”).
The law of the case doctrine does not apply to decisions of the trial
courts. Meyer & Anna Prentis Family Foundation, Inc v Barbara An n
Karmanos Cancer Institute, 266 Mich App 39, 52-53 (2005) (trial cour t
possessed unrestricted discretion in reviewing prior decisions made b y
the court). The doctrine also does not apply to arbitration proceedings.
Cipriano v Cipriano, 289 Mich App 361, 375 (2010).
A party’s assertion that an appellate court’s prior decision was wrong “i s
not sufficient [reason] to justify ignoring the law-of-the-case doctrine[.] ”
Ingham Co, 329 Mich App at 304. However, “in criminal cases, a trial cour t
retains the power to grant a new trial at any time where ‘justice has no t
been done.’” People v Herrera (On Remand), 204 Mich App 333, 340 (1994),
quoting MCL 770.1. “[I]n criminal cases the law of the case doctrine doe s
not automatically doom the defendant’s arguments or automaticall y
render them frivolous and worthy of sanctions.” Herrera, 204 Mich App
at 341.
Under the law of the case doctrine, “the trial court may not take actio n
that is inconsistent with the judgment of [the Court of Appeals],” and
“‘[w]here the trial court misapprehends the law to be applied, an abus e
of discretion occurs.’” Augustine v Allstate Ins Co, 292 Mich App 408, 425
(2011), quoting Bynum v ESAB Group, Inc, 467 Mich 280, 283 (2002) (tria l
court abused its discretion where it misapprehended the law to b e
applied, its action was inconsistent with the Court of Appeals’ remand
directive, and it failed to properly apply caselaw as explicitly directed b y
the Court of Appeals).
Standard of Review. Whether the law of the case doctrine applies is a
question of law subject to de novo review. Ashker, 245 Mich App at 13.
2.19 Judicial Estoppel
“Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine, which generally prevents a
party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and the n
relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.” Andros
v Andros, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). Under the “prior success model ”
of judicial estoppel, “‘a party who has successfully and unequivocall y
asserted a position in a prior proceeding is estopped from asserting a n
inconsistent position in a subsequent proceeding.’” Id. at ___, quoting
Lichon v American Univ Ins Co, 435 Mich 408, 416 (1990). “For judicial
estoppel to apply, ‘there must be some indication that the court in th e
earlier proceeding accepted that party’s position as true,’ and ‘the claim s
Page 2-80 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 161 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 2.19
must be wholly inconsistent.’” Andros, ___ Mich App at ___, quoting
Paschke v Retool Indus, 445 Mich 502, 510 (1994).
In order for a party to assert judicial estoppel based on a prio r
bankruptcy petition, “a reviewing court must find that
(1) the plaintiff assumed a position that was contrary to the
one that she asserted under oath in the bankruptcy
proceedings; (2) the bankruptcy court adopted the contrary
position either as a preliminary matter or as part of a final
disposition; and (3) the plaintiff’s omission did not resul t
from mistake or inadvertence. In determining whether the
plaintiff’s conduct resulted from mistake or inadvertence, the
reviewing court considers whether: (1) the plaintiff lacked
knowledge of the factual basis of the undisclosed claims; (2)
the plaintiff had a motive for concealment; and (3) the
evidence indicates an absence of bad faith. In determining
whether there was an absence of bad faith, the reviewing
court will look, in particular, at the plaintiff’s attempts t o
advise the bankruptcy court of the plaintiff’s omitted claim.”
[Andros, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up) (applying prio r
success model to bankruptcy proceedings).
“‘The purpose of the doctrine of judicial estoppel, especially in th e
context of bankruptcy proceedings, is to protect the judicial process, no t
the parties.’” Id. at ___, quoting Spohn v Van Dyke Pub Sch, 296 Mich App
470, 489 (2012). In Andros, “[a]fter agreeing to repay her mother for the
mortgage on a home she hoped to one day own, plaintiff . . . filed for
bankruptcy and declared that she had no legal or equitable interest in th e
property.” Andros, ___ Mich App at ___. “When the mother-daughter
relationship soured, her mother . . . sought to evict her.” Id. at ___. “In
response, [plaintiff] sued her mother, asserting legal ownership an d
equitable claims to the home.” Id. at ___ (noting that plaintiff’s “claim s
for constructive trust, breach of contract, quiet title, and injunctive relie f
[were] all ultimately derived from her asserted ownership interest in th e
house”). “Because she unambiguously denied having any suc h
ownership interest in her bankruptcy petition, [the Andros Court ]
affirm[ed] the trial court’s grant of summary disposition on thos e
counts.” Id. at ___. “She is assuming a position contrary to the one she
asserted in bankruptcy; the bankruptcy court adopted her prior positio n
in discharging her debts; and her misstatement was not the result of an y
legally cognizable mistake or inadvertence.” Id. at ___. “She knew sh e
intended to own the house once it was paid off, her concealment helped
secure bankruptcy relief, and she never corrected the record after th e
bankruptcy case began.” Id. at ___. While “a close familial relationship ”
may explain plaintiff’s belief that she had an ownership interest in th e
house, “she represented to the bankruptcy court that she did not have a n
interest in the house, and the purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect th e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 2-81
=== Page 162 ===
Section 2.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
integrity of the judicial process.” Id. at ___ (holding that “judicial
estoppel bars [plaintiff] from claiming ownership of the home she onc e
disavowed, but it does not necessarily bar her [unjust enrichment o r
quantum meruit claim] seeking compensation for what she put into it”).
2.20 Mootness
“To ensure that the judiciary only exercises judicial power and does not
usurp the power of other branches of government, Michigan courts and
federal courts have developed justiciability doctrines, including
mootness, to ensure that cases are appropriately before the court.” Equity
Funding, Inc v Village of Milford, 342 Mich App 342, 349 (2022) (quotatio n
marks omitted) (“Judicial power pertains to the right of courts of proper
jurisdiction to determine actual cases and controversies arising betwee n
adversaries.”). “If an issue is moot, the court may not adjudicate th e
claim.” Id. See K2 Retail Constr Servs, Inc v West Lansing Retail Dev, LLC,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (“An element of the authority granted t o
courts under Article VI of the Michigan Constitution is that courts will
not reach moot issues.”).
“One of the most critical aspects of judicial authority is the requiremen t
there be a real controversy between the parties, as opposed to a
hypothetical one, and a case is moot if it presents only abstract question s
of law, which do not rest on existing facts or rights.” Nelson v Beaumon t
Health, ___ Mich App ___, ___ n 8 (2025) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted). “However, mootness is a threshold issue trial courts mus t
address before reaching the substantive issues of a case.” Id. “Further, the
court must address mootness when it arises, whether that is in a repl y
brief or sua sponte.” Equity Funding, 342 Mich App at 349; see also id. a t
351 (holding that “once the circuit court became aware of the mootnes s
issue, it was obligated to address it”). “If an issue is moot, the court may
not adjudicate the claim.” Id. at 349.
“An issue is rendered moot when an event has occurred that renders i t
impossible for the court to grant relief.” Duckett v Solky, 341 Mich App
706, 731 (2022) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “An issue is als o
moot when a judgment, if entered, cannot for any reason have a practica l
legal effect on the existing controversy.” Id. at 731-732. Put differently,
“courts typically refrain from deciding issues that are moot when it i s
impossible for the court to craft an order with any practical effect on th e
issue.” Eagan v Detroit, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up).
However, a court may “review moot issues if they are publicl y
significant, likely to recur, and yet likely to evade judicial review. ”
Duckett, 341 Mich App at 732 (quotation marks and citation omitted).

3.1 Civil Pleadings
A. Generally
The Michigan Court Rules recognize the following civil pleadings:
• Complaint;
• Cross-claim;
• Counterclaim;
• Third-party complaint;
• Answer to a complaint, cross-claim, counterclaim, or
third-party complaint; and
• Reply to an answer. MCR 2.110(A).
Responsive pleadings are required in response to a complaint,
counterclaim, cross-claim, third-party complaint, or an answe r
demanding a reply. MCR 2.110(B).
Affirmative defenses are not pleadings for purposes of MCR 2.110(A),
and therefore, do not require a response. McCracken v Detroit, 29 1
Mich App 522, 523 (2011).
MCR 2.111(A)-(B) governs the format of pleadings, in general, while
1
MCR 2.111(C) governs the content of responsive pleadings.
Pleadings are also subject to the requirements of MCR 1.109(D)(3)
(addressing document verification requirements) and MCR 1.109(E)
(addressing document signature requirements). See MCR 2.111(A). At
least one attorney of record, or a party if not represented by a n
attorney, must sign any pleading. MCR 1.109(E)(2). “If a document i s
not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after th e
omission is called to the attention of the party.” MCR 1.109(E)(3). “A n
electronic signature is acceptable in accordance with [MCR
1.109(E)(4)].” MCR 1.109(E)(4). “The following form is acceptable: /s /
John L. Smith.” MCR 1.109(E)(4)(a).
A pleading or other document filed by an unrepresented individual
who is incarcerated in prison or jail “must be deemed timely filed if i t
was deposited in the institution’s outgoing mail on or before the filin g
deadline. Proof of timely filing may include a receipt of mailing, a
sworn statement setting forth the date of deposit and that postage ha s
been prepaid, or other evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp )
1MCR 2.112 governs the pleading of special matters.

showing that the document was timely deposited and that postag e
was prepaid.”
Committee Tip:
Courts may receive pleadings filed by an in pr o
per party (often submitted in letter format) .
Filings should be reviewed by court staff to
determine whether the “pleading” was properly
served or is ex parte communication. See Sectio n
1.3(A) for more information on ex part e
communication. Additionally, the court may
dismiss a matter, MCR 2.504(B), or enter a
default, MCR 2.603, if the filing fails to comply
with MCR 2.111(C). See Section 4.10(D)
regarding involuntary dismissal as a sanction
and Section 4.11 regarding defaults. However,
courts should recall that dismissal is a drastic
action. To facilitate justice, all available options
should be considered to devise a sanction that is
just and proper (i.e., granting a period in which
the party may file an amended pleading in an
attempt to cure any defects).

B. Electronic Filing
“Electronic filing [(e-filing)] and electronic service of documents i s
governed by [MCR 1.109(G)] and the policies and standards of th e
State Court Administrative Office [(SCAO)].” MCR 1.109(D)(7).
Courts must implement e-filing and electronic service capabilities i n
accordance with MCR 1.109, and comply with standards established
by SCAO. MCR 1.109(G)(2). “Confidential and nonpublic information
or documents and sealed documents that are electronically filed o r
electronically served must be filed or served in compliance with these
standards to ensure secure transmission of the information.” Id.
Courts must:
• accept e-filings and allow electronic service of
documents;
• comply with the e-filing guidelines and plans approved
by SCAO; and
2See the MiFile webpage for more information on Michigan’s e-filing system.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-3

Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
• maintain electronic documents in accordance with the
standards established by SCAO. MCR 1.109(G)(3)(a)(i)-
(iii).
“[C]ourts that seek permission to mandate that all litigants e-Fil e
[must] first submit an e-Filing Access Plan for approval by the Stat e
Court Administrative Office.” Administrative Order No. 2019-2, 504
Mich xviii (2019). “Each plan must conform to the mode l
promulgated by the State Court Administrator and ensure access to a t
least one computer workstation per county.” Id. “The State Cour t
Administrative Office may revoke approval of an e-Filing Access Pla n
due to litigant grievances.” Id.
Courts must accommodate the filing and serving of materials tha t
cannot be done so electronically. MCR 1.109(G)(3)(c). “The clerk of the
court shall convert to electronic format certain documents filed o n
paper in accordance with the electronic filing implementation plan s
established by [SCAO].” MCR 1.109(G)(3)(d). “A court may
electronically send any notice, order, opinion, or other documen t
issued by the court in that case by means of the electronic-filin g
system.” MCR 1.109(G)(3)(e). MCR 1.109(G)(3)(e) does not “eliminat e
any responsibility of a party, under these rules, to serve document s
that have been issued by the court.” Id. Attorneys must electronically
file documents for required case types in courts that hav e
implemented electronic filing, unless the attorney is exempt from e-
filing under MCR 1.109(G)(3)(h) because of a disability. MCR
1.109(G)(3)(f). “All other filers are required to electronically fil e
documents only in courts that have been granted approval t o
mandate electronic filing by [SCAO.]” Id. See Section 3.1(B)(1)(c) for
information on exemptions from e-filing mandates.
“There is only one official court record, regardless whether original o r
suitable-duplicate and regardless of the medium.” MCR 8.119(D)(4).
“Documents electronically filed with the court or generate d
electronically by the court are original records and are the official
court record. A paper printout of any electronically filed or generated
document is a copy and is a nonrecord for purposes of record s
retention and disposal.” Id.
1. Electronic Filing Process
a. General Provisions
Authorized users must electronically provide specified
3
case information, including e-mail addresses fo r
4
achieving e-service. MCR 1.109(G)(5)(a)(i). Th e
authorized user is responsible for ensuring that a filing
has been received by the e-filing system, and mus t

=== Page 167 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.1
immediately notify the clerk of the court if it is discovered
that the version of the document available for viewing
through the e-filing system does not depict the documen t
as submitted (and must resubmit the document if
necessary). MCR 1.109(G)(5)(a)(ii). The authorized use r
may file a motion with the court pursuant to MCR
1.109(G)(7) if a controversy arises between the clerk of th e
5
court and the authorized user. MCR 1.109(G)(5)(a)(ii).
If the court rejects a submitted document pursuant t o
MCR 8.119(C), the clerk must notify the authorized use r
of the rejection and the reason for the rejection. MCR
1.109(G)(5)(a)(iii). The rejection must be recorded in an e-
filing transaction (from the court to the authorized user),
but the rejected document does not become part of the
official court record. Id.
b. Timing
“A document submitted electronically is deemed filed
with the court when the transmission to the electronic-
filing system is completed and the required filing fee s
6
have been paid or waived.” MCR 1.109(G)(5)(b). “If a
document is submitted with a request to waive the filing
fees, no fees will be charged at the time of filing and the
document is deemed filed on the date the document wa s
submitted to the court.” Id. “A transmission is complete d
when the transaction is recorded as prescribed in [MCR
1.109(G)(5)(c)].” MCR 1.109(G)(5)(b). The filing date is th e
date the document was submitted, regardless of the date
the clerk of the court accepts the filing. Id. A documen t
submitted at or before 11:59 p.m. of a business day i s
deemed filed on that business day. Id. “Any documen t
submitted on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or other
day on which the court is closed pursuant to court order
is deemed filed on the next business day.” Id.
c. Exemptions from Mandatory E-Filing
“Where electronic filing is mandated, a party may file
paper documents with that court and be served wit h
3 Specified case information must be proved in the form and manner established by SCAO and othe r
applicable rules. At a minimum, it must “include the name, an address for service, an e-mail address, and a
telephone number of every party[.]” MCR 1.109(D)(2).

paper documents according to [MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(ii)] if
the party can demonstrate good cause for an exemption.”
MCR 1.109(G)(3)(g). “For purposes of [MCR 1.109], a
court shall consider the following factors in determining
whether the party has demonstrated good cause:
(i) Whether the person has a lack of reliable
access to an electronic device that include s
access to the Internet;
(ii) Whether the person must travel an
unreasonable distance to access a publi c
computer or has limited access t o
transportation and is unable to access the e-
Filing system from home;
(iii) Whether the person has the technical
ability to use and understand email an d
electronic filing software;
(iv) Whether access from a home computer
system or the ability to gain access at a publi c
computer terminal present a safety issue fo r
the person;
(v) Any other relevant factor raised by a
person.” MCR 1.109(G)(3)(g).
“Upon request, the following persons are exempt fro m
electronic filing without the need to demonstrate good
cause:
(i) a person who has a disability as defined
under the Americans with Disabilities Act
that prevents or limits the person’s ability t o
use the electronic filing system;
(ii) a person who has limited English
proficiency that prevents or limits th e
person’s ability to use the electronic filin g
system; and
(iii) a party who is confined by governmental
authority, including but not limited to a n
individual who is incarcerated in a jail o r
prison facility, detained in a juvenile facility,
or committed to a medical or mental healt h
facility.” MCR 1.109(G)(3)(h).
An exemption request must be filed (in paper) on a SCA O
approved form, verified under MCR 1.109(D)(3), and no
Page 3-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 169 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.1
fee may be charged for the request. MCR 1.109(G)(3)(i)(i).
“The request . . . must specify the reasons that prevent th e
individual from filing electronically” and may be
supported with documents. Id. “If the individual filed
paper documents at the same time as the request for
exemption under [MCR 1.109(G)(3)(i)], the clerk shall
process the documents for filing. If the documents mee t
the filing requirements of [MCR 1.109(D)], they will b e
considered filed on the day they were submitted.” MCR
1.109(G)(3)(j).
A request for exemption from e-filing under MCR
1.109(G)(3)(h) must “be approved by the clerk of the cour t
on a form approved by [SCAO].” MCR 1.109(G)(3)(i)(ii). I f
the clerk is unable to grant an exemption, the clerk mus t
immediately submit the request for judicial review. Id. A
judge is required to review requests made under MCR
1.109(G)(3)(g) and MCR 1.109(G)(3)(h)(i), and any
requests not granted by the clerk. MCR 1.109(G)(3)(i)(ii).
A court must “issue an order granting or denying the
request within two business days of the date the reques t
was filed.” Id. The clerk “must hand deliver or promptly
mail the clerk approval granted or order entered under
[MCR 1.109(G)(3)(i) to the individual. MCR
1.109(G)(3)(k). The request, any supportin g
documentation, and the clerk approval or order must be
placed in the case file. Id. “If there is no case file, th e
documents must be maintained in a group file.” Id. “If the
request was made under [MCR 1.109(G)(3)(h)(i)], both the
Request for Exemption from Use of MiFILE and the
Request for Reasonable Accomodations [sic], along wit h
any supporting documentation and the clerk approval or
order shall be maintained confidentially.” MCR
1.109(G)(3)(k).
“An exemption granted under [MCR 1.109] is valid onl y
for the court in which it was filed and for the life of the
case unless the individual exempted from filing
electronically registers with the electronic-filing system.”
MCR 1.109(G)(3)(l). An individual who waives exemptio n
(by registering with the electronic-filing system)
“becomes subject to the rules of electronic filing and the
requirements of the electronic-filing system. A n
individual who waives an exemption . . . may file another
request for exemption.” Id.

2. Electronic-Service Process
Service of process of case initiating documents must be made i n
accordance with the rules and laws applicable to the particular
case type. MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(i).
Generally, service of process of all other documents e-filed mus t
be performed through the e-filing system. MCR
1.109(G)(6)(a)(ii). However, service must be made by any othe r
method required by Michigan Court Rules if a party has bee n
exempted from electronic filing or has not registered with the e-
filing system. Id. “Delivery of documents through the electronic-
filing system in conformity with [the Michigan Court Rules] i s
valid and effective personal service and is proof of service under
Michigan Court Rules.” MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(iii). “Except fo r
service of process of initiating documents and as otherwise
directed by the court or court rule, service may be performed
simultaneously with filing.” MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(iv). “When a
court rule permits service by mail, service may be accomplished
electronically under [MCR 1.109(G)(6)].” MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(v).
Parties and attorneys are required to file with the court and serve
on other parties or attorneys a written notice of a change i n
contact information, which includes name, physical address,
mailing address, phone number, and email address (whe n
required). MCR 1.109(D)(11)(a). The written notice of changed
contact information must be served in accordance with MCR
2.107(C) or MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a). MCR 1.109(D)(11)(a). The clerk
of the court must update the case caption with the modified
contact information; however, the case title shall not be modified
as a result of a change of name. MCR 1.109(D)(11)(b). The cour t
and parties to the case must send or serve subsequen t
documents to the new mailing address as required by MCR
2.107(C) or the new email address as required by MCR
1.109(G)(6)(a). MCR 1.109(D)(11)(c).
“A document served electronically through the electronic-filing
system in conformity with all applicable requirements of thi s
rule is considered served when the transmission to the
recipient’s e-mail address is completed. A transmission i s
completed when the transaction is recorded as prescribed i n
[MCR 1.109(G)(6)(c)].” MCR 1.109(G)(6)(b).

3. Transmission Failures
“In the event the electronic-filing system fails to transmit a
document submitted for filing, the authorized user may file a
motion requesting that the court enter an order permitting the
document to be deemed filed on the date it was first attempted
to be sent electronically.” MCR 1.109(G)(7)(a). “The authorized
user must prove to the court’s satisfaction that:
(i) the filing was attempted at the time asserted b y
the authorized user;
(ii) the electronic-filing system failed to transmi t
the electronic document; and
(iii) the transmission failure was not caused, i n
whole or in part, by any action or inaction of the
authorized user. A transmission failure caused by a
problem with the filer’s telephone line, ISP,
hardware, or software shall be attributed to the
filer.” MCR 1.109(G)(7)(a)(i)-(iii).
“Electronic service by the electronic-filing system is complete
upon transmission as defined in [MCR 1.109(G)(6)(b)] unless the
person or entity making service learns that the attempted service
did not reach the intended recipient.” MCR 1.109(G)(7)(d). “I f
the transmission is undeliverable, the person or entity
responsible for serving the document must immediately serve
by regular mail under MCR 2.107(C)(3) or by delivery unde r
MCR 2.107(C)(1) or [MCR 2.107(C)(2)] the document and a copy
of the notice indicating that the transmission wa s
undeliverable”; “[t]he person or entity must also include a copy
of the notice when filing proof of service with the court under
[MCR 1.109(G)].” MCR 1.109(G)(7)(d)(i). “A recipient who i s
served with a notice under [MCR 1.109(G)(7)(d)(i)] should
ensure the electronic filing system reflects their current email
address.” MCR 1.109(G)(7)(d)(ii).
If the e-filing system fails to transmit a document selected for
service and that document is deemed necessary to ensure due
process rights are protected, the State Court Administrator mus t
“provide notice to the affected persons in either of the following
ways:
(i) file, as a nonparty, a notice of defective service i n
each affected case and, as deemed appropriate,
serve the notice, or
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-9
=== Page 172 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(ii) send notice of a system-wide transmissio n
failure to each affected system user.” MCR
1.109(G)(7)(e).
“If notice is provided under [MCR 1.109(G)(7)(e)], the clerk o f
the court where the affected case is filed must enter the event i n
the case history in accordance with MCR 8.119(D)(1)(a).” MCR
1.109(G)(7)(f). A fee must “not be assessed on a motion filed
claiming that rights in the case were adversely affected by
transmission failure of a document selected for service.” MCR
1.109(G)(7)(g).
4. Fees
“Beginning March 1, 2016, if a fee for commencing a civil actio n
is authorized or required by law, in addition to that fee, the clerk

[Chapter 19A of the Revised Judicature Act of 1961, MCL 600.101
et seq.] is the only fee that may be charged to or collected in a
civil action specifically for electronic filing.” MCL 600.1987(1).
8MCL 600.1993 provides that “[a] clerk shall not collect an electronic filing system fee under [MCL
600.1986(1)] after February 28, 2031.”

b. Waiver and Exceptions
“If the court waives payment of a fee for commencing a
civil action because the court determines that the party i s
indigent or unable to pay the fee, the court shall als o
waive payment of the electronic filing system fee.” MCL

“If a document is submitted with a request to waive the
filing fees, no fees will be charged at the time of filing and
the document is deemed filed on the date the documen t
was submitted to the court.” MCR 1.109(G)(5)(b).
“A party that is a governmental entity is not required t o

c. Automated Payment
“The clerk may accept automated payment of any fee
being paid to the court. If the bank or other electroni c
commerce business charges the court or court funding
unit a merchant transaction fee, the clerk may charge the
person paying the fee an additional automated paymen t
service fee as authorized by [SCAO]. The amount of the
automated payment service fee shall not exceed the actual
merchant transaction fee to be charged to the court or
court funding unit for accepting an automated paymen t
by a bank or other electronic commerce business, or 3% of
the automated payment, whichever is less.” MCL
600.1986(5).
C. Appearance
Filing an appearance entitles a party or attorney to be served with all
documents as provided by MCR 2.107(A). MCR 2.117(A)(2); see also
MCR 2.117(B)(1). MCR 2.117 addresses appearances by parties and by
attorneys representing parties. An appearance by an attorney for a
party is deemed an appearance by the party. MCR 2.117(B)(1). A n
appearance by a law firm is deemed an appearance of the individua l
attorney and every member of the law firm. MCR 2.117(B)(4); Plunkett
& Cooney, PC v Capitol Bancorp, Ltd, 212 Mich App 325, 329 (1995).
13
1. Limited Appearance
An attorney may appear on behalf of a party “for limited
purposes during the course of an action, including, but no t
limited to, depositions, hearings, discovery, and motion practice,
if the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The attorney files and serves a notice of limite d
appearance with the court before or during the
relevant action or proceeding, and all parties of
record are served with the limited entry of
appearance; and
(ii) The notice of limited appearance identifies th e
limitation of the scope by date, time period, and/or
subject matter.” MCR 2.117(B)(2)(c). See als o
MRPC 1.2(b).
“An attorney who has filed a notice of limited appearance mus t
restrict activities in accordance with the notice or any amended
13See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Stages of Limited Scope Representation table.
Page 3-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 175 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.1
limited appearance. Should an attorney’s representation exceed
the scope of the limited appearance, opposing counsel (by
motion), or the court (by order to show cause), may set a hearing
to establish the actual scope of representation.” MCR
2.117(B)(2)(d).
14
2. Duration of Appearance
Generally, an attorney’s appearance continues until a final
judgment or final order is entered and the time for an appeal of
right has passed. MCR 2.117(C)(1). However, in som e
circumstances, the attorney may withdraw from the action or be
substituted earlier in the case. See MCR 2.117(C)(2); MCR
2.117(C)(4). Regarding withdrawal, generally, “an attorney wh o
has entered an appearance may withdraw from the action or be
substituted for only on order of the court.” MCR 2.117(C)(2).
However, an attorney who filed a notice of limited appearance
may withdraw by filing a notice of withdrawal from the limited
appearance with the court and serving it on all parties of record.
MCR 2.117(C)(4). If the party has signed the withdrawal, it i s
effective immediately upon filing and service. Id. If the party has
not signed the withdrawal, it is effective 14 days after filing and
service, unless the self-represented party “files and serves a
written objection to the withdrawal on the grounds that the
attorney did not complete the agreed upon services. Id.
After a limited appearance ends or an order is entered removing
an attorney from the case, that attorney must no longer be
served case-related documents. MCR 2.117(E).
3. Nonappearance of Attorney Assisting in Document
Preparation
“An attorney who assists in the preparation of pleadings or other
documents without signing them, as authorized in MRPC 1.2(b),
has not filed an appearance and shall not be deemed to have
done so.” MCR 2.117(D). See also MRPC 1.2(b)(2) (indicatin g
that the party must designate as “self-represented”). Note tha t
any document prepared by an attorney who has not signed i t
must include the statement: “‘This document was drafted or
partially drafted with the assistance of a lawyer licensed t o
practice in the State of Michigan, pursuant to Michigan Rule of
Professional Conduct 1.2(b).’” MRPC 1.2(b)(1). MCR 2.117(D)
“shall not be construed to prevent the court from investigating
14See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Stages of Limited Scope Representation table.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-13
=== Page 176 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
issues concerning the preparation of such a document.” Id.
Although the attorney may rely on the client’s representation of
facts when preparing the document, there are limitations a s
outlined in MRPC 1.2(b)(2).
4. Inferred Appearance
An appearance, for purposes of the default rules, may be based
upon written and oral communications with opposing counsel.
Ragnone v Wirsing, 141 Mich App 263, 265-266 (1985).
5. Appearance by Foreign Attorney
a. Temporary Admission to the Bar
MCR 8.126 sets forth the process for temporary admissio n
of foreign attorneys to the State Bar of Michigan (the Bar).
The foreign attorney is not a member of the Bar and mus t
be licensed to practice law in another state or territory of
the United States of America, in the District of Columbia,
in a Tribal Court, or in a foreign country and cannot be
disbarred or suspended in any jurisdiction. MCR
8.126(A)(1). A foreign attorney must proceed through a
sponsoring attorney to request temporary admission (pr o
hac vice admission) to practice before a tribunal i n
Michigan. MCR 8.126(B)(1). The sponsoring attorney
must be a member of the Bar. MCR 8.126(A)(2).
“Permission for a foreign attorney to appear and practice
is within the discretion of the tribunal.” MCR 8.126(B)(1).
Limited number of cases. A foreign attorney is no t
permitted to appear in more than five cases in any 365-
day period, except as provided in MCR 8.126(B)(3). MCR
8.126(B)(2).
Unlimited temporary admission. A foreign attorney wh o
has submitted an application to practice law withou t
examination pursuant to BLE Rule 5 is not subject to any
limitation on the number of cases in which the attorney
may be eligible for temporary admission while th e
application is pending before the Board of Law
Examiners. MCR 8.126(B)(3). A foreign attorney mus t
notify the Bar if the application for admission to practic e
law without examination has been withdrawn or decided
by the Board of Law Examiners, and the foreign attorney
is no longer eligible for unlimited temporary admission t o
the Bar. Id.

b. Procedure for Foreign Attorneys
“The sponsoring attorney must appear as counsel of
record and file a motion asking the tribunal to grant the
foreign attorney temporary admission to practice.” MCR
8.126(C)(1). “The motion must be supported with:
(a) a certificate of good standing for th e
foreign attorney issued within the last 30 day s
by a jurisdiction where the foreign attorney i s
licensed and eligible to practice;
(b) an affidavit signed by the foreign attorney
that verifies:
(i) the jurisdiction(s) in which th e
foreign attorney is or has been licensed
or has sought licensure;
(ii) the jurisdiction(s) where the foreign
attorney is presently eligible to practice
and the foreign attorney’s good standing
in all jurisdictions where licensed;
(iii) that the foreign attorney is no t
disbarred, suspended from the practice
of law, nor the subject of any pending
disciplinary action, in any jurisdiction;
and
(iv) that the foreign attorney is familia r
with the Michigan Rules of Professional
Conduct, the Michigan Rules of
Evidence, and [the Michigan Cour t
Rules].
(v) for foreign attorneys who are no t
subject to the 5-case limitation described
in [MCR 8.126(B)(2)], that the foreign
attorney has applied for admission t o
practice law under BLE Rule 5 and tha t
the application is pending before the
Board of Law Examiners.
(c) a copy of any disciplinary disposition s
concerning the foreign attorney;
(d) a statement by the sponsoring attorney
that the sponsoring attorney:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-15
=== Page 178 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(i) has read the foreign attorney’ s
affidavit and any disciplinary
dispositions concerning the foreig n
attorney;
(ii) believes the foreign attorney’ s
representations to be true; and
(iii) will ensure that the procedures o f
this rule are followed.” MCR 8.126(C)(1).
Fee for temporary admission. “Prior to filing the motio n
with the tribunal, the motion and supporting material s
must be filed with the Bar together with a fee equal to th e
discipline and client-protection portions of a Bar
member’s annual dues or a request to waive the fee a s
provided in [MCR 8.126(B)(4)].” MCR 8.126(C)(2).
Bar report. Within seven days after receiving the foreig n
attorney’s motion for temporary admission withou t
examination and supporting materials, the Bar mus t
report the following information to the tribunal, the
sponsoring attorney, and the foreign attorney:
“(a) the jurisdiction(s) in which the foreig n
attorney is licensed;
(b) that the fee has been paid to the Bar or
waived; and
(c) the number of times that the foreig n
attorney has been granted temporar y
admission to practice within the past 365 day s
and a statement regarding whether th e
foreign attorney is subject to the 5-cas e
limitation described in [MCR 8.126(B)(2)].”
MCR 8.126(C)(2).
The tribunal cannot enter an order granting the foreig n
attorney temporary admission to practice in Michiga n
until after it receives the Bar’s report. MCR 8.126(C)(3).
The tribunal may issue an order for temporary admissio n
if it finds, after receiving the Bar’s report, that the
requirements of MCR 8.126 have been met. MCR
8.126(C)(3).
Notification and discipline. A foreign attorney must file
with the Bar a copy of the order granting temporary
admission to practice in Michigan within seven days after
the order is issued by the tribunal. MCR 8.126(C)(4). A
foreign attorney must also notify the Bar if the case i s
Page 3-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 179 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.1
dismissed or closed before the tribunal grants or denie s
temporary admission. MCR 8.126(C)(5). Further, a foreig n
attorney must notify the Bar and each tribunal in whic h
they are temporarily admitted to practice “[w]ithin seve n
days of learning that they are no longer in good standing
with any jurisdiction where licensed or temporarily
admitted to practice[.]” MCR 8.126(C)(6). A foreig n
attorney consents to the jurisdiction of Michigan’ s
attorney discipline system by seeking permission t o
appear under MCR 8.126. MCR 8.126(C)(7).
c. Duration and Scope of Temporary Admission
If a court grants a foreign attorney temporary admission
to practice, “the temporary admission continues for the
entire case, including through all appeals, any remands,
and any facilitation, mediation, or arbitration that may be
ordered[.]” MCR 8.126(D)(1).
If an arbitrator or administrative agency grants a foreig n
attorney temporary admission to practice, “that tribunal
may grant a foreign attorney temporary admission t o
practice only for the limited purpose of representing a
party in the arbitration or administrative proceeding.”
MCR 8.126(D)(2). “If the arbitration or administrativ e
proceeding results in a case or other proceeding before a
court, then the foreign attorney must apply for temporary
admission before the court.” Id.
d. Revocation
The tribunal before whom a foreign attorney is practicin g
“may revoke the attorney’s temporary admission at any
time for misconduct.” MCR 8.126(E)(1). The tribunal
“must revoke the attorney’s temporary admission upo n
receiving notice that the attorney is no longer in good
standing under [MCR 8.126(C)(6)].” MCR 8.126(E)(2). “I f
the tribunal revokes a foreign attorney’s temporary
admission under [MCR 8.126], the tribunal mus t
immediately notify the foreign attorney, the Bar, the
sponsoring attorney, the Attorney Grievanc e
Commission, and the licensing authority in the state(s) i n
which the attorney is permanently licensed, of it s
decision.” MCR 8.126(E).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-17
=== Page 180 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
e. Sponsoring Attorney
“If a tribunal allows a sponsoring attorney to withdraw,
another member of the Bar must appear as a sponsorin g
attorney with the foreign attorney.” MCR 8.126(F)(1). “ A
sponsoring attorney must have the authority to conduc t
the case or proceeding if the foreign attorney does not or
is unable to do so for any reason.” Id. A tribunal ma y
waive this requirement after a foreign attorney is granted
temporary admission to practice, however. MCR
8.126(F)(2).
f. Distribution of SBM Fee
“If a request for investigation is filed with the grievance
administrator against a foreign attorney temporarily
admitted to practice under [MCR 8.126], the entir e
amount of the fee(s) paid to the Bar for the case(s) i n
which the allegations of misconduct arose must be
transferred to the disciplinary system.” MCR 8.126(G).
g. Waiver of Subsequent Fees While First
Application Is Pending
“After paying the fee for temporary admission with the
first application for temporary admission as required by
[MCR 8.126(C)(2)], the following foreign attorneys shall
have fees waived for all subsequent applications for
temporary admission for the time period in which the
foreign attorney’s application for admission to practice
law is pending before the Board of Law Examiners:
(a) employees of a public or nonprofi t
defender office or a prosecutor’s office;
(b) employees of a legal services program tha t
is a grantee of the federal Legal Service s
Corporation or the Michigan State Ba r
Foundation; and
(c) employees of a law school clinic tha t
provides services on the basis of indigence. ”
MCR 8.126(B)(4).
h. Waiver of Initial Application Fee and
Association with Sponsoring Attorney
“A foreign attorney is not required to associate with a
sponsoring attorney, limited to the number of

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.1
appearances to practice, or required to pay the fee to the
Bar, if the foreign attorney establishes to the satisfactio n
of the tribunal in which the foreign attorney seeks t o
appear that:
(1) the foreign attorney appears for th e
limited purpose of participating in a chil d
custody proceeding as defined by MCL
712B.3(b) in a Michigan court pursuant to th e
Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act,
MCL 712B.1 et seq.; and
(2) the foreign attorney represents an India n
tribe as defined by MCL 712B.3; and
(3) the foreign attorney presents an affidavi t
from the Indian child’s tribe asserting th e
tribe’s intent to intervene and participate i n
the state court proceeding, and averring th e
child’s membership or eligibility fo r
membership under tribal law; and
(4) the foreign attorney presents an affidavi t
that verifies:
(a) the jurisdiction(s) in which th e
foreign attorney is or has been licensed
or has sought licensure;
(b) the jurisdiction(s) in which the
foreign attorney is presently admitted
and eligible to practice and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions where
licensed;
(c) that the foreign attorney is no t
disbarred, suspended from the practic e
of law, nor the subject of any pendin g
disciplinary action, in any jurisdiction ;
and
(d) that the foreign attorney is familiar
with the Michigan Rules of Professional
Conduct, the Michigan Rules of
Evidence, and [the Michigan Cour t
Rules].
(5) If the court in which the foreign attorne y
seeks to appear is satisfied that the foreign
attorney has met the requirements in [MCR
8.126(H), the court shall enter an order
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-19
=== Page 182 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
authorizing the foreign attorney’s temporary
admission.” MCR 8.126(H).
D. Complaint
“A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with a court. ”
MCR 2.101(B). It must set forth specific factual allegations stating a
claim upon which relief can be granted and contain a demand fo r
judgment. MCR 2.111(B). Statutes, court rules, and caselaw contain
requirements for particular types of claims. See MCR 2.112.
“Before filing a civil action, including an action for superintendin g
control or another extraordinary writ, the party filing the action shall
15
pay a fee of $150.00.” MCL 600.2529(1)(a).
The statute of limitations is tolled “[a]t the time the complaint is filed,
if a copy of the summons and complaint are served on the defendan t
within the time set forth in the supreme court rules.” MCL
600.5856(a). See also Gladych v New Family Homes, Inc, 468 Mich 594 ,
595, 598-605 (2003).
E. Responsive Pleading
A responsive pleading to a complaint is required. MCR 2.110(A)(5)
and MCR 2.110(B)(1). An answer is the typical responsive pleading.
1. Form of Responsive Pleading
A responsive pleading must respond to each allegation on whic h
the adverse party relies. MCR 2.111(C). “[A] responsive pleadin g
must:
(1) state an explicit admission or denial;
(2) plead no contest; or
(3) state that the pleader lacks knowledge or
information sufficient to form a belief as to the
truth of an allegation, which has the effect of a
denial.” MCR 2.111(C).
“Allegations in a pleading that requires a responsive pleading,
other than allegations of the amount of damage or the nature of
the relief demanded, are admitted if not denied in the responsive
pleading.” MCR 2.111(E)(1). “Allegations in a pleading that doe s
not require a responsive pleading are taken as denied.” MCR
15 See Section 1.11 on waiver of fees. See also Section 3.1(B)(4) on electronic filing fees.
Page 3-20 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 183 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.1
2.111(E)(2). “A pleading of no contest, provided for in [MCR
2.111(C)(2)], permits the action to proceed without proof of th e
claim or part of the claim to which the pleading is directed.”
MCR 2.111(E)(3). “Pleading no contest has the effect of a n
admission only for purposes of the pending action.” Id.
16
2. Affirmative Defense
“An affirmative defense is a defense that does not controvert the
plaintiff’s establishing a prima facie case, but that otherwise
denies relief to the plaintiff.” Stanke v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co,
200 Mich App 307, 312 (1993). In other words, an affirmative
defense accepts the plaintiff’s allegations, but would deny relief
for a reason not disclosed in the pleadings. Id. at 312. The list o f
affirmative defenses in MCR 2.111(F)(3) is not exclusive. Citizens
Ins Co of America v Juno Lighting, Inc, 247 Mich App 236, 241
(2001), citing Campbell v St John Hosp, 434 Mich 608, 616 (1990).
The party asserting an affirmative defense has the burden of
presenting evidence to support it. Palenkas v Beaumont Hosp, 432
Mich 527, 548, 550 (1989). Once evidence supporting the
affirmative defense has been introduced, the burden shifts to the
plaintiff to provide clear and decisive evidence negating the
defense. Law Offices of Jeffrey Sherbow, PC v Fieger & Fieger, PC,
326 Mich App 684, 707 (2019), rev’d in part on other grounds 507
17
Mich 272 (2021) (trial court improperly placed the burden of
proof on the plaintiff to prove defendant’s affirmative defense).
a. Timing
“An affirmative defense must be stated in a party’ s
responsive pleading or in a motion for summary
disposition made before the filing of a responsive
pleading, or the defense is waived.” Citizens Ins Co Of
America v Juno Lighting, Inc, 247 Mich App 236, 241 (2001),
citing MCR 2.111(F)(3) and Chmielewski v Xermac, Inc, 216
Mich App 707, 712 (1996), aff’d 457 Mich 593 (1998); see
also MCR 2.111(F)(2)(a). “[A]n affirmative defense is [not]
adequately preserved by raising it in a response to a
motion for leave to amend the complaint” because a
defendant’s “response to [a] motion to amend [is] not a
responsive pleading.” Dell v Citizens Ins Co of America, 312
Mich App 734, 757 (2015), citing MCR 2.110(A) (holding
that the defendant failed to adequately preserve it s
16See Section 3.1(E)(2)(a) regarding the timing of filing an affirmative defense.
17For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-21
=== Page 184 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
affirmative defense where the defense was raised i n
response to the plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the
complaint). See Section 3.7(E) for additional discussion.
b. Amendment
“[D]espite the language in MCR 2.111(F)(3) tha t
affirmative defenses should be part of the responsive
pleadings, affirmative defenses do not amount to a
pleading by themselves nor do affirmative defense s
demanding a reply count as a pleading requiring a
response.” McCracken v Detroit, 291 Mich App 522, 528
(2011). “Although affirmative defenses are no t
‘pleadings,’ the court rules unambiguously permit the m
to be amended in the same manner as pleadings.” Tyra v
Organ Procurement Agency of Mich, 302 Mich App 208, 21 3
(2013) (citation omitted), overruled in part on other
18
grounds 498 Mich 68, 74 (2015). “[A] defendant may
move to amend their affirmative defenses to add any tha t
become apparent at any time, and any such motio n
should be granted as a matter of course so long as doing
so would not prejudice the plaintiff.” Tyra, 302 Mich Ap p
at 213, citing MCR 2.118(A)(2).
If a defense is based on a written instrument, a copy of the
instrument must be attached to the pleading and labeled
according to standards established by the State Cour t
Administrative Office, subject to exceptions listed in the
court rule. MCR 2.113(C)(1). Additionally, affirmative
defenses must be listed under a separate heading and
must include the facts constituting such defense. MCR
2.111(F)(3). “The purpose of this requirement is t o
provide the opposing party with sufficient notice of the
alleged affirmative defenses to permit that party to take a
responsive position, and a stated affirmative defense tha t
does so will not be deemed insufficient.” Tyra, 302 Mic h
App at 213-214. “[A] statement of an affirmative defense
must contain facts setting forth why and how the part y
asserting it believes the affirmative defense is applicable.”
Id. at 214.

3. Time for Filing and Serving Responsive Pleadings
If personally served with complaint in Michigan. Th e
defendant must serve and file an answer or take other action, a s
permitted, within 21 days of being served with notice. MCR
2.108(A)(1).
If served with complaint outside Michigan or manner of
service required was by registered mail. The defendant mus t
serve and file an answer or take other action, as permitted,
within 28 days of being served with notice. MCR 2.108(A)(2).
If served with complaint via substituted service (posting or
publication). The court must allow the defendant a reasonable
time to answer or take other action as permitted. The time
prescribed must not be less than 28 days after publication or
posting is complete. MCR 2.108(A)(3).
If served with a pleading stating a cross-claim or counterclaim
against the party. The served party must serve and file a reply
within 21 days after service of the pleading to which the reply i s
directed. MCR 2.108(A)(4).
If served with a pleading to which a reply is required or
permitted. The served party may serve and file a reply within 2 1
days of being served with the pleading to which the reply i s
directed. MCR 2.108(A)(5).
If the action alleges medical malpractice and is filed on or after
October 1, 1986. Unless the defendant responded pursuant t o
MCR 2.108(A)(1) or MCR 2.108(A)(2), he or she “must serve and
file an answer within 21 days after being served with the notice
of filing the security for costs or the affidavit in lieu of suc h
security as required by MCL 600.2912d.” MCR 2.108(A)(6).
A motion raising a defense or an objection to a pleading must be
filed and served within 21 days of service or the time for filing a
responsive pleading. MCR 2.108(B).
F. Counterclaims and Cross-Claims
1. Designation of Cross-Claim or Counterclaim
A cross-claim or counterclaim may be combined with an answer
if it is clearly designated as such. MCR 2.110(C). If it is no t
clearly designated in the answer, no responsive pleading i s
19See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Filing and Serving Responsive Pleadings Table.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-23
=== Page 186 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
required to the cross-claim or counterclaim. MCR 2.110(C)(1).
When there is no designation, the court has discretion to declare
the pleading as “properly designated and require the party t o
amend the pleading, direct the opposing party to file a
responsive pleading, or enter another appropriate order.” MCR
2.110(C)(2). If a cross-claim or counterclaim is designated as a
defense or vice versa, the court may declare the designatio n
proper and enter an appropriate order. MCR 2.110(C)(3).
2. Counterclaim Against Opposing Party
“A counterclaim may, but need not, diminish or defeat the
recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim relief
exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the
pleading of the opposing party.” MCR 2.203(C).
3. Counterclaim Excepted From Operation of Periods of
Limitations
Pursuant to MCL 600.5823, to the extent of the amoun t
established as the plaintiff’s claim, the periods of limitation s
prescribed in [MCL 600.5801 et. seq.] do not bar a counterclaim,
unless it was barred at the time the plaintiff’s claim accrued. See,
generally, Wallace v Patterson, 405 Mich 825 (1979); Warner v
Sullivan, 249 Mich 469 (1930).
4. Cross-Claim Against Co-Party
A party may file a cross-claim against a co-party. MCR 2.203(D).
“A pleading may state as a cross-claim a claim by one party
against a co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence
that is the subject matter of the original action or of a
counterclaim, or that relates to property that is the subject matter
of the original action. The cross-claim may include a claim tha t
the party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the
cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the actio n
against the cross-claimant.” Id.
5. Time for Filing Counterclaim or Cross-Claim
Generally, a counterclaim arising out of the same transaction or
occurrence as the principal claim must be joined in one action.
MCR 2.203(A). However, if leave to amend to state a
counterclaim or cross-claim is denied, and the ruling court doe s
not expressly preclude a separate action, the party is not bound
by the compulsory joinder rule and is free to raise the claim i n
another action. MCR 2.203(E). In other words, a counterclaim or
cross-claim may be litigated in a separate action to the exten t

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.1
20
allowed by the rules of collateral estoppel and res judicata, an d
as long as the court did not specifically preclude a separate
action when it denied a party’s request for leave to amend. Salem
Indus, Inc v Mooney Process Equip Co, 175 Mich App 213, 21 6
(1988).
G. Service of Pleadings and Other Documents
“Unless otherwise stated in this rule, every party who has filed a
pleading, an appearance, or a motion must be served with a copy o f
every document later filed in the action.” MCR 2.107(A)(1). Except as
provided in MCR 2.603, this requirement ends “after a default is
entered against a party,” unless the party “file[s] an appearance or a
written demand for service of documents.” MCR 2.107(A)(2).
Service must generally be made on the attorney for a represented
party; however, the party must be served the original summons and
complaint, the notice or order in contempt proceedings fo r
disobeying a court order, all documents after entry of final judgmen t
21
or final order and after the time for an appeal of right has passed,
and in instances where the court orders service on the party. MCR
2.107(B)(1).
Except under MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a), all documents served to a party or
a party’s attorney must be served via delivery or first-class mail. MCR
22
2.107(C). “Except as provided by MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(ii), the partie s
may agree to alternative electronic service among themselves by filin g
a stipulation in that case,” which may include email, text message, o r
an email or text message alert to log into a secure website to vie w
notices and court papers. MCR 2.107(C)(4)(a). “Some or all of the
parties may also agree to alternative electronic service of notices and
court documents in a particular case by a court or a friend of the cour t
by filing an agreement with the court or friend of the cour t
respectively.” Id. “This rule does not require the court or the friend of
the court to create functionality it does not have nor accommodat e
more than one standard for alternative electronic service.” MCR
2.107(C)(4)(k).
20See Section 2.17 for additional discussion of collateral estoppel and res judicata.
21 Service must be made on the party in this circumstance “unless the rule governing the particular
postjudgment procedure specifically allows service on the attorney.” MCR 2.107(B)(1)(c).
22“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.107], until further order of the Court, all service of
process except for case initiation must be performed using electronic means (e-Filing where available,
email, or fax, where available) to the greatest extent possible. Email transmission does not requir e
agreement by the other party(s) but should otherwise comply as much as possible with the provisions of
[MCR 2.107(C)(4)].” MCR 2.107(G).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-25
=== Page 188 ===
Section 3.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“Except as otherwise provided in MCR 2.104, [MCR] 2.105, or [MCR]
2.106, proof of service of documents required or permitted to be
served must be by written acknowledgment of service, or a writte n
statement by the individual who served the documents verified unde r
MCR 1.109(D[)](3). The proof of service may be included at the end of
the document as filed. Proof of service must be filed promptly and a t
least at or before a hearing to which the document relates.” MCR
2.107(D).
H. Filing Documents Under Seal
“Except for documents filed pursuant to a protective order issued
under MCR 2.302(C), a party seeking to file a document under seal
must comply with [MCR 1.109(D)(8)].” MCR 1.109(G)(5)(d). Unde r
MCR 1.109(D)(8), “[p]ublic documents may not be filed under seal
except when the court has previously entered an order in the cas e
under MCR 2.302(C). However, a document may be made nonpubli c
temporarily before an order is entered as follows:
(a) A filer may request that a public document be mad e
nonpublic temporarily when filing a motion to seal a
document under MCR 8.119(I). As part of the filing, the
filer shall provide a proposed order granting the motio n
to seal and shall identify each document that is to be
sealed under the order. The filer shall bear the burden o f
establishing good cause for sealing the document.
(b) Pending the court’s order, the filer shall serve on al l
the parties:
(i) copies of the motion to seal and the request t o
make each document nonpublic temporarily,
(ii) each document to be sealed, and
(iii) the proposed order.
(c) The clerk of the court shall ensure that th e
documents identified in the motion are made nonpubli c
pending entry of the order.
(d) Before entering an order sealing a document unde r
this rule, the court shall comply with MCR 8.119(I). On
entry of the order on the motion, the clerk shall seal onl y
those documents stated in the court’s order and shal l
remove the nonpublic status of any of the document s
23
that were not stated in the order.” MCR 1.109(D)(8).
23See Section 1.2 for additional information on sealing records pursuant to MCR 8.119(I).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.2
I. Extending Time for Serving and Filing Pleading
MCR 2.108(E) states:
“A court may, with notice to the other parties who hav e
appeared, extend the time for serving and filing a
pleading or motion or the doing of another act, if th e
request is made before the expiration of the perio d
originally prescribed. After the expiration of the origina l
period, the court may, on motion, permit a party to act i f
the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.
However, if a rule governing a particular act limits th e
authority to extend the time, those limitations must b e
observed. MCR 2.603(D) applies if a default has been
entered.”
A motion to stay proceedings does not extend the time for filing a n
answer as does a motion made under MCR 2.108(E) because “nothing
in the motion notifies the trial court of the defendant’s desire t o
extend the time, as a motion under MCR 2.108(E) does.” Huntingto n
Nat’l Bank v Ristich, 292 Mich App 376, 382 (2011). The only way a
party may request an extension of time for filing an answer is by filin g
a motion under MCR 2.108(E). Huntington Nat’l Bank, 292 Mich Ap p
at 382-383.
J. Standard of Review
“Whether a particular ground for dismissal is an affirmative defens e
under MCR 2.111(F) is a question of law that is reviewed de novo[.] ”
Citizens Ins Co of America v Juno Lighting, Inc, 247 Mich App 236, 241
(2001).
3.2 Joinder
A. Joinder of Claims
Compulsory Joinder. A party stating a claim against an opposing
party in a pleading “must join every claim that the pleader ha s
against that opposing party at the time of serving the pleading, if i t
arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter o f
the action and does not require for its adjudication the presence o f
third parties over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.” MCR
2.203(A).
Permissive Joinder. A party may join any other claims that it ha s
against an opposing party. MCR 2.203(B). Anyone who is or may b e

Section 3.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
interested in the subject matter of the action, but whose names canno t
be established, may be joined as parties and should be described as:
“(a) unknown claimants;
(b) unknown owners; or
(c) unknown heirs, devisees, or assignees of a decease d
person who may have been interested in the subjec t
matter of the action.” MCR 2.201(D)(1).
If it cannot be determined, upon diligent inquiry, (1) whether a perso n
who is or may be interested in the subject matter of the action is aliv e
or dead, (2) how the person would have disposed of his or he r
interest, or (3) where the person resides if alive, then “the person and
everyone claiming under him or her may be made parties by namin g
the person and adding the words ‘or [his or her] unknown heirs,
devisees, or assignees.’” MCR 2.201(D)(1).
B. Joinder of Parties
Necessary Joinder. A party must join “persons having such interests
in the subject matter of an action that their presence in the action i s
essential to permit the court to render complete relief[.]” MCR
2.205(A). The court is required to summon such parties who ar e
subject to the court’s jurisdiction into the action if they have not bee n
joined. MCR 2.205(B). If the court cannot obtain jurisdiction, it may
still proceed as provided by MCR 2.205(B).
Permissive Joinder. A person may join or be joined as a co-party if the
joiner asserts a right (or, in the case of a defendant, has a righ t
asserted against him or her) to joint or several relief or relief arising
out of the same transaction or transactions and all parties share a
common question of law or fact, or “if their presence in the action will
promote the convenient administration of justice[.]” MCR 2.206(A)(1)-
(2).
The court has the authority to add or drop parties at any time, on jus t
terms. MCR 2.207.
Joining Parties to a Counterclaim or Cross-Claim. “Persons othe r
than those made parties to the original action may be made parties t o
a counterclaim or cross-claim, subject to MCR 2.205 and [MCR
2.206].” MCR 2.203(G)(1). “On the filing of a counterclaim or cross-
claim adding new parties, the court clerk shall issue a summons fo r
each new party in the same manner as on the filing of a complaint, a s
provided in MCR 2.102(A)-(C). Unless the court orders otherwise, the
summons is valid for 21 days after the court issues it.” MCR
2.203(G)(2).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.2
C. Nonparties
In actions “seeking damages for personal injury, property damage, o r
wrongful death, the liability of each person shall be allocated unde r
[MCL 600.2957] by the trier of fact and, subject to [MCL 600.6304], i n
direct proportion to the person’s percentage of fault.” MCL
600.2957(1). “In assessing percentages of fault under this subsection,
the trier of fact shall consider the fault of each person, regardless of
whether the person is, or could have been, named as a party to th e
action.” Id.
1. Notice of Nonparty Fault
In a personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death action,
the trier of fact may not assess the fault of a nonparty unles s
notice has been given as provided in MCR 2.112(K)(3). MCR
2.112(K)(2). See also MCL 600.2957. “[A] defendant’s failure t o
give the notice required under [MCR 2.112(K)] amounts to a
procedural waiver of the right to have a nonparty assigned faul t
as proved under MCL 600.6304 and MCL 600.2957.” Taylor v
Mich Petroleum Technologies, Inc, 307 Mich App 189, 199 (2014).
Further, the identification of an alleged nonparty at fault withi n
the notice of affirmative defenses in a defendant’s answer doe s
not satisfy the requirements of MCR 2.112(K); rather, affirmativ e
defenses and a notice of nonparty at fault “must be separately
stated under a distinct heading, if not in a separate document.”
Taylor, 307 Mich App at 202 (noting that, “even if [the defendant]
could properly give notice of nonparty at fault along with it s
notice of affirmative defenses,” its notice was deficient where i t
“did not identify [the nonparty] as a nonparty at fault, did no t
cite MCR 2.112(K), and did not otherwise state that [th e
defendant] was asserting its right to have the finder of fac t
allocate fault to [the nonparty,]” and concluding that “because
proper notice . . . is a prerequisite to the application of MCL
600.2957(2), the trial court could not apply that provision to save
[the plaintiffs’] otherwise untimely claims against [the
nonparty]”).
2. Response to Notice of Nonparty Fault
Once a party has been served with notice, the served party “may
file an amended pleading stating a claim or claims against the
nonparty within 91 days of service of the first notice identifyin g
that nonparty.” MCR 2.112(K)(4). See also MCL 600.2957(2),
which adds, “[u]pon motion of a party within 91 days after
identification of a nonparty, the court shall grant leave to the
moving party to file and serve an amended pleading alleging 1
or more causes of action against that nonparty. A cause of action
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-29
=== Page 192 ===
Section 3.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
added under this subsection is not barred by a period of
limitation unless the cause of action would have been barred by
a period of limitation at the time of the filing of the original
action.”
The Court of Appeals concluded that no conflict exists betwee n
MCL 600.2957(2) and MCR 2.112(K) in regard to the period o f
limitations and that the statute of limitations is extended t o
nonparties added pursuant to the statute. Bint v Doe, 274 Mic h
App 232, 234-235 (2007) (noting that “MCR 2.112(K) contains no
language regarding periods of limitations”). “MCL 600.2957(2)
and MCR 2.112(K) do not irreconcilably conflict” because “the
court rule addresses the conduct of the parties, whereas the
statute is directed at the conduct of the court.” Stenzel v Best Buy
Co, Inc, 503 Mich 199, 202, 203 (2019) (quotation marks,
alteration, and citation omitted). “As a result, a plaintiff may
elect to amend the complaint without filing a motion for leave t o
amend. If the plaintiff so elects the court shall grant the
amendment. Alternatively, if a plaintiff wishes to file a motion t o
add a nonparty, the plaintiff is permitted to do so under MCL
600.2957(2).” Stenzel, 503 Mich at 203 (quotation marks,
alterations, and citations omitted). The Michigan Supreme Cour t
“promulgated MCR 2.112(K)(4) to implement MCL 600.2957, no t
to supplant it.” Stenzel, 503 Mich at 203 (quotation marks and
citation omitted). Therefore, “a party may amend a pleading
upon receipt of notice of nonparty fault pursuant to MCR
2.112(K) without filing a motion for leave to amend, and the
amended pleading relates back to the original action pursuant t o
MCL 600.2957(2).” Stenzel, 503 Mich at 202.
3. Liability of Nonparty
If a nonparty is found to be at fault, the nonparty is not subject t o
liability in that action, and the determination of fault may not be
introduced as evidence of liability in any subsequent action.
MCL 600.2957(3); Rinke v Potrzebowski, 254 Mich App 411, 415
(2002).
4. Relation-Back Provision
MCL 600.2957(2), the relation-back provision, reads:
“Upon motion of a party within 91 days after
identification of a nonparty, the court shall gran t
leave to the moving party to file and serve a n
amended pleading alleging 1 or more causes o f
action against that nonparty. A cause of actio n
added under this subsection is not barred by a
Page 3-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 193 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.3
period of limitation unless the cause of actio n
would have been barred by a period of limitatio n
at the time of the filing of the original action.”
When a party’s timely cause of action brought in federal court i s
dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, the party’s subsequent
cause of action in state court relates back to the time the federal
cause of action was initiated. St Clair v XPO Logistics, Inc, __ _
Mich ___, ___ (2024). “MCL 600.2957(2) applies such that th e
timeliness of the subsequent complaint in state court, not just the
amended complaint in federal court, is judged by the timelines s
of the first complaint in federal court.” St Clair, ___ Mich at ___.
In St Clair, the timeliness of the plaintiff’s claim against the
defendant turned on whether MCL 600.2957(2) applied whe n
the initial cause of action had been filed in federal court. St Clair,
___ Mich at ___. “Because plaintiff sought to bring the same
negligence cause of action against [defendant] in her state cour t
complaint as she did in her amended federal complaint,” the
Michigan Supreme Court held that “MCL 600.2957(2) applies
such that the state court complaint is timely as well.” St Clair, __ _
Mich at ____. “In other words, the first sentence of MCL
600.2957(2) allowed plaintiff to serve her amended pleading i n
federal court alleging a negligence cause of action agains t
[defendant].” St Clair, ___ Mich at ____. “That same negligenc e
cause of action, regardless of what court it was brought in and
whether it was first brought in federal court and then refiled i n
state court, is a cause of action added under MCL 600.2957(2) ,
and is not barred by a period of limitation unless the cause of
action would have been barred by a period of limitation at the
time of the filing of the original action.” St Clair, ___ Mich at __ _
(cleaned up). Consequently, because the plaintiff’s federal
complaint—the original action—was timely, “the cause of actio n
against [defendant in state court was] timely.” Id. at ___.
D. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision regarding joinder is reviewed for an abuse o f
discretion. Mason Co v Dep’t of Community Health, 293 Mich App 462,
489 (2011).
3.3 Summons
A. First Summons
The clerk issues a summons when a complaint is filed. MCR 2.102(A).
The summons must be served as provided in MCR 2.103 and MCR
2.105. MCR 2.102(A). The form of the summons is prescribed in MCR
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-31
=== Page 194 ===
Section 3.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2.102(B). Generally, the summons expires 91 days after the date it is
issued. MCR 2.102(D). However, that timeframe may be extended
under certain circumstances. See Section 3.3(C) for more information.
B. Duplicate Summons
“A duplicate summons may be issued from time to time and is a s
valid as the original summons.” MCR 2.102(A). “Duplicat e
summonses issued under [MCR 2.102(A)] do not extend the life of th e
original summons.” MCR 2.102(D).
C. Second Summons
A request to issue a second summons must be made before th e
original summons expires; similarly, the court’s order granting a
second summons must be entered before the original summon s
expires. See MCR 2.102(D); Moriarity v Shields, 260 Mich App 566, 57 5
(2004) (holding that a clerk’s issuance of the second summons after th e
expiration of the original summons was still valid where the cour t
order granting the second summons was entered within the effectiv e
period of the original summons).
Upon “a showing of due diligence by the plaintiff in attempting t o
serve the original summons,” the court may “order a second
summons to issue for a definite period not exceeding 1 year from th e
date the summons is issued.” MCR 2.102(D). “[D]ue diligence unde r
MCR 2.102(D) means diligent efforts in trying to serve process, no t
diligence in matters logically preceding the decision to serv e
process.” Bush v Beemer, 224 Mich App 457, 464 (1997) (rejecting the
plaintiff’s claim that “diligent efforts to determine whether a case ha s
merit constitutes good cause for delayed service” because thi s
determination “should precede the filing of the complaint”).
Regarding efforts to try to serve process, “due diligence require s
efforts that are more than a mere gesture.” Ickes v Korte, 331 Mich Ap p
436, 443 (2020) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “[D]ue
diligence means undertaking reasonable, good-faith measures unde r
the circumstances, not necessarily everything possible.” Id. n 3 (due
diligence “does not require the commission of acts that are illegal,
professionally unethical, or otherwise impermissible under an y
applicable rules or regulations”). The trial court did not abuse it s
discretion in determining that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate du e
diligence where the record showed that the “plaintiff made no effor t
to serve defendant until about three weeks before the original
summons was set to expire,” the plaintiff “did not avail himself of th e
multiple methods reasonably available to him to locate defendant, ”
and “an interrogatory answer in [simultaneous] litigation contained
defendant’s current address.” Id. at 443.
Page 3-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 195 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.3
If an extension (up to one year) is granted for the second summons, i t
“expires at the end of the extended period.” MCR 2.102(D). Th e
issuance of a third summons is not permitted under MCR 2.102(D).
Hyslop v Wojjusik, 252 Mich App 500, 506-507 (2002).
Committee Tip:
Where the motion for a second summons
requests an unreasonable amount of time within
which to complete service, and the request
seems unnecessary or designed to protract the
litigation, the court may set a shorter time for
service.
D. Dismissal
Service of a valid summons is a necessary part of service of process.
Holliday v Townley, 189 Mich App 424, 425-426 (1991). If a defendant i s
not served before the expiration of the summons, the action is deemed
dismissed without prejudice as to that defendant, unless th e
defendant has submitted to the court’s jurisdiction. MCR
24
2.102(E)(1). If the defendant was added after the first complaint wa s
filed, time begins to run from the date of the first pleading namin g
that defendant as a party. Id. The clerk is responsible for entering th e
order dismissing the action and for providing notice of the entry a s
provided in MCR 2.107; failure to enter the order or provide proper
notice “does not continue an action deemed dismissed” or “affect th e
dismissal.” MCR 2.102(E)(2)-(3).
The court may set aside the dismissal based on the stipulation of th e
parties or on a motion as provided by MCR 2.102(F). If setting asid e
based on a motion, the following conditions must be met: The motio n
must be filed within 28 days after notice of the order of dismissal wa s
given, or if notice was not given, promptly upon learning of th e
dismissal, MCR 2.102(F)(3); the moving party must establish tha t
proof of service was in fact made within the time provided in MCR
2.102(D) or that the defendant submitted to the court’s jurisdiction,
MCR 2.102(F)(1); and the moving party must establish that “proof o f
service of process was filed or the failure to file is excused for good
25
cause shown[.]” MCR 2.102(F)(2).
24See Section 4.10 for additional discussion of dismissals, including dismissal for lack of progress.
25 See Section 3.4 on service of process.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-33
=== Page 196 ===
Section 3.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
3.4 Service of Process
“Service-of-process rules are intended to satisfy the due proces s
requirement that a defendant be informed of the pendency of an actio n
by the best means available, by methods reasonably calculated to give a
defendant actual notice of the proceeding and an opportunity to be heard
and to present objections or defenses.” Hill v Frawley, 155 Mich App 611,
613 (1986).
A. Who May Serve Process
Generally, any legally competent adult who is not a party or an office r
of a corporate party may act as a process server. MCR 2.103(A).
However, certain types of cases require a specific person to serve
process. See MCR 2.108(B)-(D).
“[A] process server who is on the land or premises of another while i n
the process of attempting, by the most direct route, to serve proces s
upon any of the following: (a) [a]n owner or occupant of the land o r
premises[;] (b) [a]n agent of the owner or occupant of the land o r
premises[;] (c) [a] lessee of the land or premises,” is exempt from th e
prohibition on trespassing set out in MCL 750.552(1). MCL 750.552(2).
B. Proof of Service
A party must show proof of service. MCR 2.104. “Delivery o f
documents through the electronic-filing system in conformity with
[the Michigan Court Rules] . . . is proof of [personal] service unde r
26
Michigan Court Rules.” MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(iii). Otherwise, a part y
may show proof of service by providing:
“(1) written acknowledgment of the receipt of a
summons and a copy of the complaint, dated an d
signed by the person to whom the service is directed o r
by a person authorized under these rules to receive th e
service of process;
(2) a certificate stating the facts of service, including th e
manner, time, date, and place of service, if service i s
made within the State of Michigan by
(a) a sheriff,
(b) a deputy sheriff or bailiff, if that officer hold s
office in the county in which the court issuing the
process is held,
26 See Section 3.1(B)(2) for more information on electronic-service process.
Page 3-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 197 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.4
(c) an appointed court officer,
(d) an attorney for a party; or
(3) a written statement of the facts of service, verified
under MCR 1.109(D)(3). The statement shall include th e
manner, time, date, and place of service, and indicatin g
the process server’s official capacity, if any.
The place of service must be described by giving th e
address where the service was made or, if the servic e
was not made at a particular address, by anothe r
description of the location.” MCR 2.104(A)(1)-(3).
MCL 600.1910(1) provides that “[p]roof of service of process may b e
made by 1 of the following methods:
(a) Written acknowledgment of the receipt of a
summons and a copy of the complaint, dated an d
signed by the person authorized under this act t o
receive them.
(b) A certificate, stating the facts of service, if service i s
made in this state by any of the following:
(i) A sheriff.
(ii) A deputy sheriff, medical examiner, cour t
officer, or constable, or a deputy of any of thes e
officers, if the officers held office in a county i n
which the court issuing the process is held.
(c) If service is made by any other individual, a writte n
statement of the facts of service, verified by th e
following statement: ‘I declare under the penalty o f
perjury that this proof of service has been examined b y
me and that its contents are true to the best of m y
information, knowledge, and belief.’.”
The validity of the service is not affected by a party’s failure to file th e
proof of service. MCR 2.104(B); MCL 600.1910(2).
27
C. Manner of Service
The manner of service depends on the entity of defendant. MCR
28
2.105. The requirements for valid service are set forth as follows :
• individuals (resident or non resident), MCR 2.105(A);
27See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Service of Process Table.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-35
=== Page 198 ===
Section 3.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
• individuals (nonresident, minor, defendant for whom a
guardian or conservator has been appointed and i s
acting, individual doing business under an assume d
name) and substituted service, MCR 2.105(B);
• partnerships and limited partnerships, MCR 2.105(C);
• private corporations (domestic and foreign), MCR
2.105(D);
• partnership associations and unincorporated voluntary
associations, MCR 2.105(E);
• service on an insurer, MCR 2.105(F);
• certain corporations, unincorporated board, or publi c
body, MCR 2.105(G);
• limited liability company, MCR 2.105(H); and
• agent authorized by appointment or by law, MCR
2.105(I)(1).
Generally. A plaintiff may serve process on a resident or nonresiden t
individual by transmitting a document in the e-filing system, MCR
1.109(G), or by personally delivering or sending a summons and a
copy of the complaint via “registered or certified mail, return receip t
requested, and delivery restricted to the addressee,” MCR
2.105(A)(1)-(2). “By restricting delivery to a specifically identified
person, [MCR 2.105(A)] avoids disputes about whether a defendant
has deliberately refused service.” Bullington, 293 Mich App at 557 (th e
plaintiff violated MCR 2.105(A)(2) by failing to attempt service by
certified mail without restricting delivery to the defendant).
“Delivery of documents through the electronic-filing system i n
conformity with [the Michigan Court Rules] is valid and effectiv e
29
personal service . . . .” MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a)(iii).
Substituted Service. MCR 2.105(J) addresses when and how
substituted service can be made. The court may enter an orde r
permitting substituted service if the plaintiff files a verified motio n
dated not more than 14 days before it is filed. MCR 2.105(J).
28“If a rule uses the term registered mail, that term includes the term ‘certified mail’, and the term
‘registered mail, return receipt requested’ includes the term ‘certified mail, return receipt requested.’
However, if certified mail is used, the receipt of mailing must have been postmarked by the post office. ”
MCR 2.105(L)(1). “If a rule uses the term ‘certified mail’, a postmarked receipt of mailing is not required.
Registered mail may be used when a rule requires certified mail.” MCR 2.105(L)(2).
29 See Section 3.1(B)(2) for more information on electronic service process.
Page 3-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 199 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.4
The motion must meet all procedural requirements set forth in MCR
2.105(J)(2). The court may direct a hearing on the motion, but it is no t
required. MCR 2.105(J)(2). Substituted “[s]ervice of process may no t
be made . . . before entry of the court’s order permitting it.” MCR
2.105(J)(3).
The order must include all of the information specified in MCR
2.106(C). The court may order substituted service via posting o r
publication. MCR 2.106(A). See MCR 2.106(D) and MCR 2.106(E) o n
how to accomplish service via posting or publication.
Service by Mail. “The proper addressing and mailing of a lette r
creates a legal presumption that it was received. This presumptio n
may be rebutted by evidence, but whether it was [received] is a
question for the trier of fact.” Stacey v Sankovich, 19 Mich App 688, 69 4
(1969).
D. Exemptions from Service and Privileged Persons
Civil process cannot be served:
• “[O]n an elector entitled to vote at an election during the
day that election is held. However, if sufficient cause i s
shown by affidavit to the satisfaction of a judge, tha t
judge may issue a restraining order or authorize th e
issuance and service or execution of a writ[.]” MCL
600.1831(1).
• “[O]n a person attending a worship meeting of a
religious organization that has tax exempt status . . . , o n
property where the organization normally conducts it s
worship, or going to or coming from such a meetin g
within 500 feet of that property. A judge may orde r
service or execution of process notwithstanding thi s
subsection if, to the judge’s satisfaction, sufficient caus e
is shown by affidavit.” MCL 600.1831(2).
The following persons are privileged from civil process:
• “All persons going to, attending, or returning from, any
court proceedings in any action in which their presenc e
is needed . . . if service could not have been made on
them had they not gone to, attended, or returned fro m
the proceedings.” MCL 600.1835(1).
• “Any person brought into this state by or after waiver of
extradition based on a criminal charge . . . in civil action s
arising out of the same facts as the criminal proceeding s
which he or she is returned to answer until he or she ha s
been convicted in the criminal proceeding, or, i f
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-37
=== Page 200 ===
Section 3.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
acquitted, until he or she has a reasonable opportunit y
to return to the state from which he or she came.” MCL
600.1835(2) (only applicable to “service of personal
process”).
• “A member of the legislature . . . on a day on which there
is a scheduled meeting of the house of which he or she i s
a member . . . [unless] such process is executed b y
certified mail, return receipt requested.” MCL
600.1835(3).
E. Defects in Service of Process or Proof of Service
Defects in the service of process are not necessarily fatal to the caus e
of action. “An action shall not be dismissed for improper service o f
process unless the service failed to inform the defendant of the actio n
within the time provided in these rules for service.” MCR 2.105(K)(3);
In re Gosnell, 234 Mich App 326, 344 (1999).
A party may challenge the sufficiency of the service or process in a
30
summary disposition motion. See MCR 2.116(C)(3). Affidavits,
together with any other documentary evidence submitted by th e
parties, must be considered by the trial court. MCR 2.116(G)(5). All
factual disputes for the purpose of deciding the motion are resolved
in favor of the nonmoving party. See Jeffrey v Rap American Corp, 44 8
Mich 178, 184 (1995). If the defendant actually receives service o f
process within the life of the summons, the fact that the manner o f
service was improper is not grounds for dismissal. MCR 2.105(K)(3);
Hill v Frawley, 155 Mich App 611, 613 (1986). See also Bunner v Blow-
Rite Insulation Co, 162 Mich App 669 (1987) (dismissal was no t
warranted where the defendant was properly served, but under a n
incorrect name). It is only where there is a failure of service of proces s
that dismissal is warranted. Holliday v Townley, 189 Mich App 424,
425-426 (1991).
MCR 2.116(I)(3) does not require a jury trial to determine whether
service of process was sufficient. Al-Shimmari v Detroit Med Ctr, 47 7
Mich 280, 283 (2007). MCR 2.116(I)(3) permits the court to order a n
immediate trial for summary motions based on MCR 2.116(C)(1)-(6),
or MCR 2.116(C)(7). Where a jury trial has been demanded, and th e
summary motion is based on MCR 2.116(C)(7), the court must allow a
jury trial on issues that include “a right to trial by jury.” MCR
2.116(I)(3).
MCR 2.116(D)(1) “provides that a defendant waives the ability t o

objection is raised in the defendant’s first motion or responsiv e
pleading[.]” Al-Shimmari, 477 Mich at 291-293. A general appearanc e
does not waive a challenge to the sufficiency of service of proces s
under MCR 2.116(C)(3). Al-Shimmari, 477 Mich at 293.
“At any time on terms that are just, a court may allow process or proo f
of service of process to be amended, unless it clearly appears that t o
do so would materially prejudice the substantive rights of the part y
against whom the process issued.” MCR 2.102(C). See also MCL
600.1905(3), which contains substantially similar language. “A n
amendment relates back to the date of the original issuance or servic e
of process unless the court determines that relation back would
unfairly prejudice the party against whom the process issued.” MCR
2.102(C).

3.5 Motion for More Definite Statement
A. Generally
A party may file a motion for a more definite statement as a remedy
to a deficient pleading. MCR 2.115(A). Pursuant to MCR 2.115(A),
“[i]f a pleading is so vague or ambiguous that it fails to comply wit h
the requirements of these rules, an opposing party may move for a
more definite statement before filing a responsive pleading. Th e
motion must point out the defects complained of and the detail s
desired.” See also Hofmann v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 211 Mich App 55, 9 0
(1995). “If the motion is granted and is not obeyed within 14 day s
after notice of the order, or within such other time as the court ma y
set, the court may strike the pleading to which the motion wa s
directed or enter an order it deems just.” MCR 2.115(A).
“[A] failure to move for a more definite statement is not proof that th e
filing was adequate to begin with.” Tyra v Organ Procurement Agency of
Mich, 302 Mich App 208, 216 (2013), overruled in part on other
32
grounds 498 Mich 68, 74 (2015). “Failing to move for a more definite
statement may mean that the other party was not confused, but it may
also mean that the other party was so confused that it was not awar e
that it was confused.” Tyra, 302 Mich App at 216.
31The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(9) and
MCR 2.408(C)(6) to motions to correct, strike, or amend pleadings. See Section 1.15 for more information

Section 3.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Committee Tip:
MCR 2.115(A) does not provide courts th e
authority to order a more definite statement sua
sponte. Due to a lack of authority on this issue, it
is unclear how appellate courts would treat a
trial court’s decision to sua sponte order a party
to file a more definite statement.
B. Timing
A motion for a more definite statement must be filed before th e
responsive pleading. Hofmann v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 211 Mich App 55,
90 (1995). See also MCR 2.115(A); MCR 2.108(B) (motions that raise a
defense or an objection to a pleading must be filed and served withi n
the time for filing a responsive pleading; if no responsive pleading i s
required, the motion must be filed and served within 21 days afte r
33
service of the pleading to which it is directed).
If a motion for a more definitive statement “made before filing a
responsive pleading is denied, the moving party must serve and file a
responsive pleading within 21 days after notice of the denial,” unles s
a different time is set by the court. MCR 2.108(C)(1). If the moving
party files an application for leave to appeal within 21 days afte r
notice of the denial, the time to serve and file a responsive pleading
“is extended until 21 days after the denial of the application unles s
the appellate court orders otherwise.” Id.
C. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision whether to grant a motion for a more definit e
statement is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Woods v SLB Pro p
Mgt, LLC, 277 Mich App 622, 625 (2008).
33A motion for more definite statement may be deemed presented for filing on the date it is deposited into
the institution’s outgoing mail if the appellant is pro se, is incarcerated in prison or jail, and meets th e
other requirements of MCR 1.112.

3.6 Motion to Strike
A. Generally
“On motion by a party or on the court’s own initiative, the court ma y
strike from a pleading redundant, immaterial, impertinent,
scandalous, or indecent matter, or may strike all or part of a pleadin g
not drawn in conformity with these rules.” MCR 2.115(B). A respons e
to a motion for summary disposition “cannot be struck” under MCR
2.115(B) because “MCR 2.110(A) defines ‘pleading’ as a complaint, a
cross-claim, a counterclaim, a third-party complaint, an answer to an y
of the above, or a reply to an answer.” Cove Creek Condo Ass’n v Vistal
Land & Home Dev, LLC, 330 Mich App 679, 717 (2019) (finding,
however, that “although the form” of defendants’ request to strik e
was improper, “there was arguable legal merit to defendants’ clai m
that the trial court should only consider the issue before it,” and “th e
trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying sanctions on thi s
basis”).
B. Timing
“[A] motion to strike should be allowed at any reasonable time.” Belle
Isle Grill Corp v Detroit, 256 Mich App 463, 471 (2003). While MCR
2.108(B) limits the time for filing a motion in response to a pleading to
within the time limits for filing a responsive pleading or within 2 1
days of being served with a pleading that requires no response, “th e
time limit imposed under MCR 2.108(B) should not be interpreted t o
control motions under MCR 2.115(B).” Belle Isle, 256 Mich App a t
35
471.
C. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision regarding a motion to strike a pleading, i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Belle Isle Grill Corp v Detroit, 256
Mich App 463, 469 (2003).
34The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(9) and
MCR 2.408(C)(6) to motions to correct, strike, or amend pleadings. See Section 1.15 for more information

35A motion to strike may be deemed presented for filing on the date it is deposited into the institution’s
outgoing mail if the appellant is pro se, is incarcerated in prison or jail, and meets the other requirement s
of MCR 1.112.

3.7 Amendment of Pleadings
37
A. Amendments of Right
Under MCL 600.2301, the court is authorized “to amend any process,
38
pleading or proceeding.” The practice of amendment is governed
by court rule. A party may amend a pleading once without th e
consent of an opponent and without the permission of the court if th e
amendment is made within 14 days of being served with a responsiv e
pleading. MCR 2.118(A)(1). If the pleading does not require a
response, it must be amended within 14 days after serving it. Id.
B. Amendments by Consent and by Leave of Court
“Motions to amend pleadings may be made at any time, even afte r
judgment.” City of Wayne v Miller, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024), citing
MCR 2.118(C)(1). A pleading may be amended at any time with th e
written consent of the opposing parties. MCR 2.118(A)(2).
A pleading may also be amended by leave of the court. Leave t o
amend must be freely given when justice so requires. MCR
2.118(A)(2). In Fyke & Sons v Gunter Co, 390 Mich 649 (1973), th e
Michigan Supreme Court discussed the “freely given” language i n
former court rule, GCR 1963, 118.1, which is identical to MCR
2.118(A)(2). The Court stated that the rule is “‘designed to facilitate
the amendment of pleadings except where prejudice to the opposin g
party would result.’” Fyke, 290 Mich at 656, quoting United States v
Hougham, 364 US 310, 316 (1960).
Generally, a motion to amend should be granted. Weymers v Khera, 45 4
Mich 639, 658-660 (1997). The motion should be denied only fo r
particularized reasons, such as (1) undue delay if the delay was in bad
faith or the opposing party suffered actual prejudice, (2) bad faith, (3 )
dilatory motive, (4) repeated failure to cure deficiencies, (5) undu e
prejudice, or (6) futility. Id. at 658-660, citing Fyke, 390 Mich at 656,
663-664.
“The Michigan Court Rules are generous with respect to the filing o f
amended complaints, . . . and the joinder or substitution of parties. ”

(2025), citing MCR 2.118(A)(2), MCR 2.116(I)(5), MCR 2.207, and MCR
2.202(D). “However, the court rules also empower a trial court t o
deny such relief if it would be unjust.” Id. at ___, citing Weymers, 45 4
Mich at 658, and MCR 2.207 (noting that MCR 2.118(A)(3) allows “ a
trial court to require reimbursement of additional expenses, includin g
reasonable attorney fees, from a party whose ‘inexcusable delay’ i n
requesting leave to amend caused an adverse party to incur thes e
expenses”). “These provisions provide trial courts ample authority
and discretion to punish misconduct, gamesmanship, or delay b y
plaintiffs, while still allowing the amendment of pleadings under th e
appropriate circumstances.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___.
“A plaintiff or counterplaintiff is not generally required to cite th e
specific statutory provision under which he is proceeding in order t o
state a claim.” City of Wayne, ___ Mich App at ___. “Rather, pleading s
need only contain factual allegations sufficient to reasonably infor m
the adverse party of the nature of the claims the adverse party i s
called on to defend.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “The fact that a n
amended complaint would present issues at odds with [a] trial court’ s
decision does not appear to be an accepted particularized reason” fo r
denying a motion to amend a complaint under MCR 2.118(A). Kincai d
v Flint, 311 Mich App 76, 95 (2015) (citations omitted).
When leave to amend is denied, the court must specify the reasons fo r
the ruling on the record. Franchino v Franchino, 263 Mich App 172, 19 0
(2004). If the court fails to specify its reasons for denying a motion t o
amend, reversal is required unless amendment would be futile.
Kincaid, 311 Mich App at 95. An amendment that is legally insufficien t
on its face is futile regardless of the claim’s substantive merits. Hakar i
v Ski Brule, Inc, 230 Mich App 352, 355 (1998).
“Delay, alone, does not warrant denial of a motion to amend. ”
Weymers, 454 Mich at 659, citing Fyke, 390 Mich at 663-664. See also
Stanke v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 200 Mich App 307, 321 (1993),
where the Court stated that “there must always be some dela y
associated with an amendment of a pleading.” Leave to amend
should be granted unless the delay occurred as a result of bad faith o r
created actual prejudice. Weymers, 454 Mich at 659, citing Fyke, 39 0
Mich at 663-664. The proper remedy for inexcusable delay is t o
impose sanctions under MCR 2.118(A)(3). Stanke, 200 Mich App at
321.
“‘Prejudice’ refers to matter[s] which would prevent a party fro m
having a fair trial, or matter[s] which he [or she] could not properl y
contest, e.g. when surprised. It does not refer to the effect on the resul t
of the trial otherwise.” Fyke, 390 Mich at 657. See also Franchino, 26 3
Mich App at 191-192 (where the plaintiff was denied his third

application to amend when its contents would have unjustifiabl y
surprised the defendant so close to trial); Weymers, 454 Mich at 659.
C. Amendments Must Be Submitted in Writing
Proposed amendments to a pleading must be submitted in writing.
MCR 2.118(A)(4); Anton, Sowerby & Assoc, Inc v Mr. C’s Lake Orion ,
LLC, 309 Mich App 535, 551 (2015).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the plaintiff’s
motion to amend its complaint where the plaintiff sought to add th e
receiver as a party defendant after summary disposition was granted
pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10) because the plaintiff, in its motion t o
amend, only “cursorily discussed the contents of its claim against th e
receiver[.]” Anton, Sowerby & Assoc, Inc, 309 Mich App at 551 (holding
that “[i]f a plaintiff does not present its proposed amended complain t
to the court, there is no way to determine whether amendment i s
justified,” and finding no abuse of discretion “[a]bsent the submissio n
of the proposed complaint in writing or a clear statement of plaintiff’ s
claim”).
D. Amendment After Motion for Summary Disposition Filed
Generally, the process for amending a pleading is governed by MCR
39
2.118. “When a trial court grants a motion for summary dispositio n
under MCR 2.116(C)(8), [MCR 2.116(C)(9)], or [MCR 2.116(C)(10)],”
MCR 2.116(I)(5) requires the court to “give the parties an opportunit y
to amend their pleadings as provided by MCR 2.118, unless th e
evidence then before the court shows that amendment would not b e
justified.” City of Wayne v Miller, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). “Th e
question, then, is how trial courts must implement that requirement. ”
Reeves v Wayne Co, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (noting that “the rul e
is not specific on the order of the rulings”) (cleaned up). “Courts hav e
implemented the rule in a variety of legitimate ways.” Id. at ___. “The
usual practice is to enter a conditional order stating that summar y
disposition is granted unless an amended pleading is filed by a
certain time.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“However, nothing forbids a court from allowing an amendmen t
even after granting summary disposition if the amendment i s
sufficient.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“There is little dispute that the opportunity to amend a pleadin g
under MCR 2.116(I)(5) generally applies only when a motion under
MCR 2.116(C)(8) has merit.” Reeves, ___ Mich App at ___. In Reeves,
39 See Section 3.7(B) for more information on amendment of pleadings by consent or leave of court unde r
MCR 2.118.
Page 3-44 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 207 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.7
the trial court granted defendants’ motion for summary disposition o f
plaintiff’s claims under the Michigan Constitution for failure to state a
viable cause of action but “denied summary disposition as to th e
remaining claims and noted that plaintiff would be permitted t o
amend his Complaint to allege intentional torts with mor e
particularity.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). However, “the trial court neve r
clearly ruled on their [MCR 2.116(C)(8)] arguments.” Reeves, ___ Mic h
App at ___. “Even so, if the motion had merit, plaintiff would have
been entitled to amend his complaint under MCR 2.116(I)(5)—whic h
[was] precisely what the trial court allowed.” Reeves, ___ Mich App a t
___ (“Importantly, plaintiff filed an amended complaint after thes e
appeals were initiated.”). “In sum, defendants received th e
procedural remedy they claim was denied.” Id. at ___. “If they believ e
the amended complaint still fails to state a claim, the proper course i s
to raise those arguments in the trial court on remand.” Id. at ___
(“conclud[ing] that defendants’ challenges to the sufficiency of
plaintiff’s original complaint [were] moot in light of the amended
complaint filed under MCR 2.116(I)(5)”). “Defendants’ assertion tha t
the rule mandates a particular sequence is not supported by the tex t
or case law.” Reeves, ___ Mich App at ___ (rejecting defendants’
argument that “the trial court should have granted their motion fo r
summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and then permitted
plaintiff to seek leave to amend his complaint”). “Reported decision s
reflect that flexibility.” Reeves, ___ Mich App at ___; see Codd v Wayne
Co, 210 Mich App 133, 137 (1995) (finding it sufficient that “the trial
court, in lieu of requiring plaintiffs to file formally an amended
complaint, allowed the parties to present supplemental briefs”); ABB
Paint Finishing, Inc v Nat’l Union Fire Ins Co, 223 Mich App 559, 564
(1997) (observing that a plaintiff could “request[] leave to amend it s
complaint before the trial court rules on a motion under [MCR
2.116(C)(8)],” which “the trial court should normally allow” under
MCR 2.116(I)(5)).
A party is not entitled to the opportunity to amend their pleadings a s
a matter of right under MCR 2.116(I)(5) if “the trial court decide[s] t o
award summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7) as well as MCR
2.116(C)(10) . . . .” Hamood v Trinity Health Corp, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2024). However, “[t]he omission of MCR 2.116(C)(7) from the
language in MCR 2.116(I)(5) affording parties the largely unfettered
right to amend their pleadings after an award of summary dispositio n
under MCR 2.116(C)(8), [MCR 2.116(C)(9)], or [MCR 2.116(C)(10)
does] not absolutely bar the trial court from granting [a] motion t o
amend [a] complaint.” Hamood, ___ Mich App at ___.
While undue delay alone “does not warrant denial of a motion t o
amend,” “the leeway granted to a plaintiff to amend a complaint i s
not a license for carelessness or gamesmanship.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted) (“characteriz[ing] plaintiff’s failure to ac t

Section 3.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
for years as undue delay that foreclosed leave to amend”). In Hamood,
plaintiff sought to amend her complaint after defendant obtained
summary disposition of all her pending claims under MCR
2.116(C)(7) and MCR 2.116(C)(10). Hamood, ___ Mich App at ___. “Bu t
by her own admission, plaintiff had the opportunity for years i n
federal court and then in state court to request leave to add her clai m
for breach of contract against [defendant], yet she failed to do s o
because ‘it fell through the cracks somehow or something[.]’” Id. a t
___. The court considered the “added costs, complications, and
challenges” associated with defense of the new claim, including
“additional rounds of discovery, in all probability interview of ne w
witnesses, gathering of further evidence, and the identification o f
appropriate legal arguments” and “did not abuse its discretion b y
denying plaintiff leave to amend her complaint.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted).
“When a party makes an oral request to amend the complaint unde r
MCR 2.116(I)(5), that party must also offer a proposed amendment in
writing.” Grayling Twp v Berry, 329 Mich App 133, 151-152 (2019). “If a
plaintiff fails to do so, the plaintiff has failed to comply with [th e
writing requirement in MCR 2.118(A)(4)] and the trial court does no t
abuse its discretion in denying the request to amend.” Grayling Twp,
329 Mich App at 152. See Section 3.7(C) for more information o n
submitting amendments in writing.
Where a party does not seek leave of the court or obtain the opposin g
party’s consent to amend his or her pleading, “MCR 2.116(I)(5) [does]
not require the court to sua sponte offer [the party] an opportunity t o
amend.” Kloian v Schwartz, 272 Mich App 232, 242 (2006) (finding n o
40
plain error in these circumstances).
E. Amendments to Conform to Evidence
MCR 2.118(C)(1) “is liberal and permissive[.] . . . The only
requirement is that the party seeking amendment move to have th e
court amend the pleadings[.]” Zdrojewski v Murphy, 254 Mich App 50 ,
61 (2002). “When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried b y
express or implied consent of the parties, they are treated as if the y
had been raised by the pleadings.” MCR 2.118(C)(1).
Where evidence is objected to at trial because it concerns issues no t
raised in the pleadings, an amendment of the pleadings to conform t o
the offered proof may be permitted under MCR 2.118(C)(2). However,
an amendment must not be allowed “unless the party seeking t o
amend satisfies the court that the amendment and the admission o f
40 See Section 4.2(D)(2) for more information.

the evidence would not prejudice the objecting party in maintainin g
his or her action or defense on the merits.” MCR 2.118(C)(2). See als o
Dacon v Transue, 441 Mich 315, 328 (1992). “The court may grant an
adjournment to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. ”
MCR 2.118(C)(2). An adjournment is not required under MCR
2.118(C)(2).
F. The “Relation-Back” Rule
Generally, amendments to pleadings relate back to the date of th e
original pleading “if the claim or defense asserted in the amended
pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth,
or attempted to be set forth, in the original pleading.” MCR
41
2.118(D). “MCR 2.118(D) does not place limits on the nature of th e
amendment. It provides for all types of amendments provided tha t
the substance relates to the same conduct as the original pleading. ”
Legion-London v Surgical Institute of Mich Ambulatory Surgery Ctr, LLC,
331 Mich App 364, 369 (2020).
“Under the relation-back doctrine, an amended pleading ca n
introduce new facts, new theories, or even a different cause of actio n
as long as the amendment arises from the same transactional settin g
that was set forth in the original pleading.” Green v Pontiac Pub Library,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“The principle to be gleaned is the necessity for a broadly focused
inquiry regarding whether the allegations in the original an d
amended pleadings stem from the same general conduct, transaction,
or occurrence.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Thus, if the cause of actio n
presented in a proposed amendment arises from the sam e
transactional setting as the original complaint, it relates back to th e
original complaint, regardless whether the proposed amendmen t
introduces new facts, a new theory, or a different cause of action.” Id.
at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
The misnomer doctrine. The misnomer doctrine “allows for the
correction of inconsequential deficiencies or technicalities in th e
naming of parties.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins
Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up) (relation back has bee n
allowed where “the right party was served by the wrong name and n o
one was misled thereby to his detriment”) (cleaned up).
Contractual limitations period. “The relation-back doctrine wa s
developed by the courts to avoid preclusion by a statute of limitation s
of an issue raised in an amended pleading by relating the amended
41“In a medical malpractice action, an amendment of an affidavit of merit or affidavit of meritorious
defense relates back to the date of the original filing of the affidavit.” MCR 2.118(D). For more information
on medical malpractice actions, see Section 9.11.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-47
=== Page 210 ===
Section 3.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
claim or defense with the date of the original pleading.” Id. at ___. Th e
relation-back rule does not apply to a contractual limitations period.
Ulrich v Farm Bureau Ins, 288 Mich App 310, 322 (2010) (concluding
that a claim for uninsured motorist benefits is governed by th e
insurance policy, a contract; thus, “to apply the relation-back doctrin e
in this context would be inconsistent with the principle of applyin g
private contracts in accordance with their terms as stated i n
unambiguous language”).
New parties. In Miller v Chapman Contracting, 477 Mich 102, 106
(2007), the Michigan Supreme Court “held that the plaintiff could no t
amend a complaint to add the proper real party in interest, th e
bankruptcy trustee, because ‘the relation-back doctrine does no t
apply to the addition of new parties.’” C-Spine, ___ Mich at n 13.
“MCR 2.118(D) specifies that an amendment relates back to the dat e
of the original pleading only if it ‘adds a claim or a defense’; it doe s
not specify that an amendment to add a new party also relates back t o
the date of the original pleading.” Miller, 477 Mich at 107. However,
the doctrine may apply to a closely connected new party where n o
one is detrimentally misled. See Arnold v Schecter, 58 Mich App 680,
683-684 (1975) (where the plaintiff misnamed the defendant a s
corporate officers rather than the actual corporation in her complain t
and (1) served the proper representative of the corporation at th e
corporation’s legal address, (2) the officers and corporation were i n
the same business and represented by the same law firm, and (3) th e
officers were informed of the fact that the plaintiff intended to sue th e
corporation, the trial court improperly denied the plaintiff’s reques t
to amend). See also Estate of Tice v Tice, 288 Mich App 665, 670-671
(2010), where the Court of Appeals concluded that the relation-bac k
doctrine applies to an amended complaint where “a plaintiff ha s
brought an action in the wrong capacity . . . if the original plaintiff
had an interest in the subject matter of the controversy.” In Estate of
Tice, the original plaintiff was the decedent’s heir who filed a
complaint in his own name and subsequently amended the complain t
so that the named plaintiff was the decedent’s estate. Id. at 667. Th e
Court concluded that “the estate should have been allowed to tak e
advantage of the original filing because [the original plaintiff], as [th e
decedent’s] heir, had an interest in the subject matter of th e
controversy.” Id. at 671.
“The Court of Appeals has concluded that an assignment of [personal
protection insurance] benefits in the middle of litigation cannot relat e
back to the original complaint date.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___, citin g
Jawad A Shah, MD, PC v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 324 Mich App
182, 202-205 (2018). In Jawad A Shah, the Court of Appeals held “tha t
the plaintiffs’ motion to file an amended complaint under MCR
2.118(D), in which they sought to add assignments from the patient t o
the plaintiff medical providers, amounted to a motion to supplemen t

the pleadings under MCR 2.118(E).” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___. “Thi s
barred the plaintiffs from recovery because a supplemental pleadin g
does not relate back to the original complaint date and the plaintiffs ’
claims were filed past the one-year-back date.” Id. at ___. See als o
Farrar v Suburban Mobility Auth for Regional Transp, 345 Mich App 472,
478 (2023) (“applying similar reasoning to bar an assignee-provider
from intervening in the assignor-patient’s suit”). The C-Spine Cour t
“express[ed] no view on whether Jawad A Shah correctly decided th e
issues involving the relation-back doctrine and the one-year-bac k
rule.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___ n 21 (“This aspect of the Court of
Appeals’ decision in Jawad A Shah was not raised by the defendant in
its application for leave to appeal, which we ultimately denied. No r
have we been asked to overrule Jawad A Shah here.”) (citation s
omitted). However, the Michigan Supreme Court “note[d] that Jawa d
A Shah was decided before the 2019 no-fault amendments added MCL
500.3145(3), which tolls the one-year-back period until the date a n
insurer formally denies the claim.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___ n 21.
When a party’s timely cause of action brought in federal court i s
dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, the party’s subsequent cause o f
action in state court relates back to the time the federal cause of actio n
was initiated. St Clair v XPO Logistics, Inc, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024).
“MCL 600.2957(2) applies such that the timeliness of the subsequen t
complaint in state court, not just the amended complaint in federal
court, is judged by the timeliness of the first complaint in federal
court.” St Clair, ___ Mich at ___. In St Clair, the timeliness of th e
plaintiff’s claim against the defendant turned on whether MCL
600.2957(2) applied when the initial cause of action had been filed i n
federal court. St Clair, ___ Mich at ___. “Because plaintiff sought t o
bring the same negligence cause of action against [defendant] in he r
state court complaint as she did in her amended federal complaint, ”
the Michigan Supreme Court held that “MCL 600.2957(2) applie s
such that the state court complaint is timely as well.” St Clair, ___
Mich at ____. “In other words, the first sentence of MCL 600.2957(2)
allowed plaintiff to serve her amended pleading in federal cour t
alleging a negligence cause of action against [defendant].” St Clair,
___ Mich at ____. “That same negligence cause of action, regardless o f
what court it was brought in and whether it was first brought i n
federal court and then refiled in state court, is a cause of action added
under MCL 600.2957(2), and is not barred by a period of limitatio n
unless the cause of action would have been barred by a period o f
limitation at the time of the filing of the original action.” St Clair, ___
Mich at ___ (cleaned up). Consequently, because the plaintiff’s federal
complaint—the original action—was timely, “the cause of actio n
against [defendant in state court was] timely.” Id. at ___.

Section 3.8 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
G. Response to Amendments
If a party is served with a proper amended pleading of a typ e
requiring a responsive pleading, the party has two choices: (1) serv e
and file a pleading in response to the amended pleading; or (2) serv e
and file a notice that the pleading filed in response to the pre-
amendment pleading will stand as a response to the amended
pleading. MCR 2.118(B).
H. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision whether to allow an amendment to a pleadin g
is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Ormsby v Capital Welding, Inc,
471 Mich 45, 53 (2004).
3.8 Third Party Practice
A. Generally
Both a defendant and a plaintiff may serve a complaint against a third
party (implead) who may be liable to the complainant for a clai m
asserted against the complainant. MCR 2.204(A) and (B). A cour t
should be liberal in exercising its discretion to join third parties,
weighing factors such as the probability of delay, complications of th e
trial, timeliness of the motion, similarity of the evidence, an d
possibility of prejudice. Caldwell v Fox, 394 Mich 401, 415 (1975).
B. Timing
Leave is not required to serve a third-party’s complaint if it is filed
within 21 days after the third-party plaintiff’s original answer wa s
filed. MCR 2.204(A)(1). After 21 days, leave on motion is required.
42
Id.
C. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision regarding whether to grant or deny a motio n
to file a third-party complaint is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
Morris v Allstate Ins Co, 230 Mich App 361, 368 (1998).
42A pleading or other document may be deemed presented for filing on the date it is deposited into the
institution’s outgoing mail if the appellant is pro se, is incarcerated in prison or jail, and meets the othe r
requirements of MCR 1.112.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 3.9
3.9 Intervention
Intervention is the act of a third party who attempts to become a party i n
a lawsuit that is already pending between others. Hill v L F Transp, Inc,
277 Mich App 500, 508 (2008).
A. Intervention of Right
A person has the right to intervene in an action by filing a timel y
application, when:
(1) a Michigan statute or court rule provides an
unconditional right to intervene;
(2) all parties stipulate to the intervention; or
(3) the applicant claims an interest in the property o r
transaction which is the subject of the action, an d
without intervention, the applicant may not be able t o
adequately protect his or her interest, unless th e
applicant’s interest is adequately represented b y
existing parties. MCR 2.209(A).
B. Permissive Intervention
A person may intervene in an action by filing a timely application,
when:
(1) a Michigan statute or court rule provides a
conditional right to intervene; or
(2) when an applicant’s claim or defense and the mai n
action share a common question of law or fact. MCR
2.209(B).
“In exercising its discretion, the court shall conside r
whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudic e
the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. ”
MCR 2.209(B)(2).
C. Timing
A right to intervene should be asserted within a reasonable time.
D’Agostini v Roseville, 396 Mich 185, 188 (1976). “Laches or
unreasonable delay by the intervenors is a proper reason to den y
43
intervention.” Id.
43See Section 9.6(D) for additional discussion of the doctrine of laches.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 3-51
=== Page 214 ===
Section 3.9 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
To be considered a timely application for permissive intervention, the
application must be made before an adjudication of the case on th e
44
merits. Dean v Dep’t of Corrections, 208 Mich App 144, 152 (1994).
D. Decision and Effect
MCR 2.209 should be liberally construed to allow intervention i n
situations where the intervenor’s interests may not be adequatel y
represented. Neal v Neal, 219 Mich App 490, 492 (1996). It may not be
proper in cases “where it will have the effect of delaying the action o r
producing a multifariousness of parties and causes of action. ”
Precision Pipe & Supply, Inc v Meram Constr, Inc, 195 Mich App 153, 15 7
(1992).
It is within the trial court’s discretion to determine whether a motio n
to intervene as of right is timely when the moving party had
knowledge of the action, and the motion was not filed until after th e
circuit court issued its decision. Davenport v Grosse Pointe Farms
Zoning Bd, 210 Mich App 400, 408 (1995).
Once permitted to intervene, either as of right or by leave, th e
intervenor becomes a party and is bound by the judgment. BCBSM v
Eaton Rapids Community Hosp, 221 Mich App 301, 307 (1997).
E. Costs
A party who intervenes in an action as a plaintiff hoping to recove r
damages from the defendant, but who does not actively participate i n
the prosecution of the action, is a party in interest for the limited
purposes of recovering damages from the defendant and subjectin g
itself to the taxation of costs in the defendant’s favor, where th e
defendant is the prevailing party in the action. See BCBSM v Eato n
Rapids Community Hosp, 221 Mich App 301, 309-312 (1997); MCR
2.625(A).
F. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision to grant or deny a motion to intervene i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Hill v L F Transp, Inc, 277 Mic h
App 500, 507 (2008).
44A pleading or other document may be deemed presented for filing on the date it is deposited into the
institution’s outgoing mail if the appellant is pro se, is incarcerated in prison or jail, and meets the othe r
requirements of MCR 1.112.

4.1 Motions
2
A. Form
Unless made during a hearing or trial, a motion must be in writing,
state with particularity the grounds and authority on which it i s
based, state the relief or order sought, and be signed by the attorne y
or party as set out in MCR 1.109(D)(3) and MCR 1.109(E). MCR
2.119(A)(1). If a contested motion is filed after a proposed order is
rejected under MCR 2.119(D), the party must attach a copy of the
rejected order and an affidavit. MCR 2.119(A)(4).
“A motion or response to a motion that presents an issue of law mus t
be accompanied by a brief citing the authority on which it is based,
[3]
and must comply with the provisions of MCR 7.215(C) regardin g
citation of unpublished Court of Appeals opinions.” MCR
2.119(A)(2). However, a trial court need not deny a motion if it is filed
without a brief, if the motion itself contains citations to legal authorit y
supporting its proposition. Woods v SLB Prop Mgt, LLC, 277 Mich App
622, 625-626 (2008). Except where electronic filing has bee n
implemented, a copy of the motion and brief, as well as any response,
must be provided to the judge. MCR 2.119(A)(2)(d).
The combined length of a motion and brief may not exceed 20 page s
double spaced (exclusive of exhibits and attachments) withou t
permission of the court. MCR 2.119(A)(2)(a). Permission to file a
motion and brief in excess of the 20-page limit should be requested
sufficiently in advance of the hearing on the motion to allow th e
opposing party adequate opportunity for analysis and response. Se e
People v Leonard, 224 Mich App 569, 578-579 (1997) (finding an abus e
of discretion where the trial court allowed the defendant to file a n
excessive-length brief during the hearing because the prosecution wa s
deprived of an opportunity to analyze and respond to the brief).
“Except as permitted by the court or as otherwise provided in thes e
rules, no reply briefs, additional briefs, or supplemental briefs may b e
filed.” MCR 2.119(A)(2)(b).
1“When an appellate court orders a new trial, that includes all phases of trial, including all pretrial matter s
such as motions for summary disposition.” Law Offices of Jeffrey Sherbow, PC v Fieger & Fieger, PC, ___
Mich App ___, ___ (2023).
2 Many jurisdictions have local court rules governing the form of motions.
3MCR 7.215(C)(1) provides that an unpublished opinion is not precedentially binding under the rule of
stare decisis and requires a party who cites an unpublished opinion to explain why it was cited and how it i s
relevant to the issues presented, and also provide a copy of the opinion to the court and to opposin g
parties.
Page 4-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 217 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.1
The motion and notice of the hearing may be combined into on e
document. MCR 2.119(A)(3).
B. Affidavit (If Required)
“Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, a
document need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit.” MCR
1.109(D)(3). However, if an affidavit is filed, it “must be verified by
oath or affirmation.” MCR 1.109(D)(1)(f). “If an affidavit is filed i n
support of or in opposition to a motion, it must:
(a) be made on personal knowledge;
(b) state with particularity facts admissible as evidenc e
establishing or denying the grounds stated in th e
motion; and
(c) show affirmatively that the affiant, if sworn as a
witness, can testify competently to the facts stated in th e
affidavit.” MCR 2.119(B)(1).
An affidavit is valid if it is: “(1) a written or printed declaration o r
statement of facts, (2) voluntarily made, and (3) confirmed by the oat h
or affirmation of the party making it, taken before a person havin g
authority to administer such oath or affirmation.” Sherry v East
Suburban Football League, 292 Mich App 23, 31 (2011). An affidavi t
lacking notarization is invalid, and a trial court may refuse to conside r
it sua sponte or on motion by an opposing party. Id.
All documents or parts of documents that are referred to in th e
affidavit must be attached to the affidavit as sworn or certified copies,
unless the documents:
“(a) have already been filed in the action;
(b) are matters of public record in the county in whic h
the action is pending;
(c) are in the possession of the adverse party, and thi s
fact is stated in the affidavit or motion; or
(d) are of such nature that attaching them would b e
unreasonable or impracticable, and this fact and th e
reasons are stated in the affidavit or the motion.” MCR
2.119(B)(2).
C. Filing and Serving Motions and Responses
“Unless the court sets a different time, a motion must be filed at leas t
7 days before the hearing, and any response to a motion required o r
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-3
=== Page 218 ===
Section 4.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
permitted by these rules must be filed at least 3 days before th e
hearing.” MCR 2.119(C)(4). Generally, filing is complete upo n
delivery to the court clerk. See MCR 1.109(C).
Unless the court rules or the trial court (for good cause) stat e
otherwise, a written motion, notice of hearing, and supporting brie f
must be served as follows:
(a) at least 9 days before the time set for hearing if b y
first-class mail; or
(b) at least 7 days before the time set for hearing i f
delivered or electronically served pursuant to MCR
4
2.107(C)(1), MCR 2.107(C)(2), or MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a).
MCR 2.119(C)(1).
Unless the court rules or the trial court (for good cause) stat e
otherwise, the response and accompanying brief and affidavits mus t
be served as follows:
(a) at least 5 days before the hearing if by first-clas s
mail; or
(b) at least 3 days before the hearing if delivered or
electronically served pursuant to MCR 2.107(C)(1),
5
MCR 2.107(C)(2), or MCR 1.109(G)(6)(a). MCR
2.119(C)(2).
The court may set different times for serving a motion or a response.
MCR 2.119(C)(3). “[I]ts authorization must be endorsed in writing on
the face of the notice of hearing or made by separate order.” Id.
D. Filings by Incarcerated Individuals
A pleading or other document filed by an unrepresented individual
who is incarcerated in prison or jail “must be deemed timely filed if i t
was deposited in the institution’s outgoing mail on or before the filin g
deadline. Proof of timely filing may include a receipt of mailing, a
sworn statement setting forth the date of deposit and that postage ha s
4”Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.107], until further order of the Court, all service o f
process except for case initiation must be performed using electronic means (e-Filing where available,
email, or fax, where available) to the greatest extent possible. Email transmission does not requir e
agreement by the other party(s) but should otherwise comply as much as possible with the provisions of
[MCR 2.107(C)(4)].” MCR 2.107(G).
5”Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.107], until further order of the Court, all service o f
process except for case initiation must be performed using electronic means (e-Filing where available,
email, or fax, where available) to the greatest extent possible. Email transmission does not requir e
agreement by the other party(s) but should otherwise comply as much as possible with the provisions of
[MCR 2.107(C)(4)].” MCR 2.107(G).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.1
been prepaid, or other evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp )
showing that the document was timely deposited and that postag e
was prepaid.” MCR 1.112.
E. Uncontested Orders
A party may serve the opposing party with a proposed order and a
request to stipulate. MCR 2.119(D)(1). Within 7 days of being served,
the other party may stipulate to the entry of the proposed order o r
waive notice and hearing. MCR 2.119(D)(2). The order is considered
rejected if the opposing party does not take either action within 7
days of being served. Id. However, if the party stipulates or waive s
notice and hearing, the court may either enter the order or require a
hearing on the motion. MCR 2.119(D)(3). The moving party mus t
serve a copy of the stipulated order to the opposing party or notif y
any parties entitled to notice under MCR 2.107 if the court requires a
hearing on the motion. MCR 2.119(D)(4).
F. Contested Motions
Contested motions should be noticed for hearing by the moving part y
at the time designated by the court for the hearing of motions. MCR
2.119(E)(1). The court may reset the time for hearing. Id.
When a motion is based on facts not in the record, it may be heard o n
affidavits presented by the parties or on oral testimony or deposition.
MCR 2.119(E)(2). “[T]he trial court itself is best equipped to decid e
whether the positions of the parties (as defined by the motion and
response, as well as by the background of the litigation) mandate a
judicial assessment of the demeanor of particular witnesses in orde r
to assess credibility as part of the fact-finding process.” Williams v
Williams, 214 Mich App 391, 399 (1995).
The court may also eliminate or limit oral arguments on motions and
order briefs in support of and in opposition to the motion. MCR
2.119(E)(3).
Appearances by the moving party and nonmoving party ar e
governed by MCR 2.119(E)(4). The moving party must appear unles s
excused by the court. MCR 2.119(E)(4)(b). The nonmoving party mus t
either appear at the hearing, or file a response containing a concis e
statement of opposition to the motion supported by legal authority.
MCR 2.119(E)(4)(a)(i)-(ii).
“If a party violates the provisions of [MCR 2.119(E)(4)(a) or MCR
2.119(E)(4)(b)], the court shall assess costs against the offending party,
that party’s attorney, or both, equal to the expenses reasonabl y
incurred by the opposing party in appearing at the hearing, includin g
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-5
=== Page 220 ===
Section 4.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
reasonable attorney fees, unless the circumstances make an award o f
expenses unjust.” MCR 2.119(E)(4)(c). The moving party may also b e
penalized by a fine not to exceed $100 for failing to appear at a
hearing on a motion. MCR 2.119(E)(4)(b).
G. Decision
When possible, all decisions should be made from the bench or withi n
a few days of submission. MCR 8.107(A). In all other cases, a decision
should be rendered no later than 35 days after submission. Id. Matters
not decided within 56 days of submission must be identified on th e
quarterly “Report as to Matters Undecided.” MCR 8.107(B).
H. Entry of Order
Except as otherwise provided in MCR 2.602 and MCR 2.603, “all
judgments and orders must be in writing, signed by the court, and
dated with the date they are signed.” MCR 2.602(A)(1). The date th e
judgment or order is signed is the date of entry. MCR 2.602(A)(2).
“Where electronic filing is implemented, judgments and orders mus t
be issued under the seal of the court.” MCR 2.602(A)(4).
Immediately before the judge’s signature, the judgment must stat e
“whether it resolves the last pending claim and closes the case.” MCR
2.602(A)(3). “Such a statement must also appear on any other order
that disposes of the last pending claim and closes the case.” Id.
The court must enter an order using one of the following methods:
• The court may sign the judgment or order when the
relief in the order or judgment is granted. MCR
2.602(B)(1).
• The court must sign the judgment or order when all
parties approve of its form, as long as it is consisten t
with the court’s decision. MCR 2.602(B)(2). For approval
of an order’s form, “the parties must agree regarding th e
order’s structure or, if relevant, any procedure that i t
may establish for the disposition of the matter before th e
court.” In re Leete Estate, 290 Mich App 647, 657 (2010).
• The court must sign a properly submitted proposed
order if no written objections have been filed within 7
days after service of notice, as long as the judgment o r
order is consistent with the court’s decision. MCR
2.602(B)(3). (This is commonly referred to as the “Seven-
Day Rule.”) If objections are received, the court mus t
schedule a hearing for all objections within 14 days afte r
receiving the first objection, or as soon thereafter as i s
Page 4-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 221 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
practicable. Id. The party filing the objection must serv e
notice of the hearing as provided in MCR 2.602(B)(3)(c).
MCR 2.602(B)(3)(d).
• “A party may prepare a proposed judgment or order and
notice it for settlement before the court.” MCR
2.602(B)(4). A motion fee may not be charged.
A party objecting to the entry of a proposed judgment under MCR
2.602(B)(3) is not required to provide a transcript of the prior
proceeding. Jones v Jones, 320 Mich App 248, 261 (2017) (holding tha t
the trial court erred by rejecting the defendant’s objections to th e
proposed judgment based on the lack of a transcript and noting tha t
“given the compressed timing requirements under [MCR 2.602], it i s
doubtful that timely obtaining a copy of a transcript would b e
possible in most circumstances”).
I. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision whether to omit or limit oral argument i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Fisher v Belcher, 269 Mich Ap p
247, 252 (2005).
“The decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing under MCR
2.119(E)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.” Williams v Williams,
214 Mich App 391, 399 (1995).
6
4.2 Summary Disposition
Although summary disposition is typically ordered in response to a
motion, MCR 2.116 does not expressly require a motion to order
summary disposition; the court may do so sua sponte. Boulton v Fenton
Twp, 272 Mich App 456, 462-463 (2006), citing MCR 2.116(I)(1). “Under
MCR 2.116(I)(1), ‘the court shall render judgment’ without delay in tw o
circumstances: ‘if the pleadings show that a party is entitled to judgmen t
as a matter of law, or if the affidavits or other proofs show that there is n o
genuine issue of material fact.’” Rowland v Detroit, ___ Mich App ___, ___
(2025) (cleaned up). “Most of the caselaw applying this provision ha s
focused on the ability of trial courts to grant relief under it sua sponte. ”
7
Id. at ___. “But that is not the sole purpose of the rule; it also establishe s
that the trial court is affirmatively required to render judgment withou t
delay when the pleadings show that a party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Th e
6The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(10) t o
motions pursuant to MCR 2.116. See Section 1.15 for more information on videoconferencing.
7See Section 4.2(E) for more information on ordering summary disposition sua sponte.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-7
=== Page 222 ===
Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
rule mandates that if one of two conditions is met, then the court shall
render judgment without delay.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Indeed, no t
only is a court permitted to grant summary disposition in these instances,
the word ‘shall’ in the court rules makes this a mandatory action once th e
court has determined that a party is entitled to judgment and there is n o
genuine issue of material fact.” Id. at ___ n 7 (quotation marks an d
citation omitted).
A. Timing
Although MCR 2.116(B)(2) allows a summary disposition motion t o
“be filed at any time consistent with [MCR 2.116(D) and MCR
2.116(G)(1)],” this court rule does not “[deprive] the trial court o f
discretion to set a limit on the time within which a motion unde r
MCR 2.116 may be filed[.]” Kemerko Clawson, LLC v RxIV Inc, 269 Mic h
App 347, 350 (2005). MCR 2.401(B)(2)(a)(ii), allowing courts to se t
pretrial deadlines through scheduling orders, is a more specifi c
provision and controls over the more general rule found in MCR
2.116. Kemerko Clawson, LLC, 269 Mich App at 351. Under MCR
2.401(B)(2)(a)(ii), “trial courts may issue scheduling orders t o
establish times for events including filing of motions.” Cleveland v
Hath, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up).
A defendant may raise an affirmative defense in a motion fo r
summary disposition. “An affirmative defense must be stated in a
party’s responsive pleading or in a motion for summary dispositio n
made before the filing of a responsive pleading, or the defense i s
waived.” Citizens Ins Co Of America v Juno Lighting, Inc, 247 Mich App
236, 241 (2001), citing MCR 2.111(F)(3) and Chmielewski v Xermac, Inc,
216 Mich App 707, 712 (1996); see also MCR 2.111(F)(2)(a). For
additional information on affirmative defenses, see Section 3.1(E)(2).
1. Motions Based on (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)(3)
Motions based on MCR 2.116(C)(1) (lack of jurisdiction over
person or property), MCR 2.116(C)(2) (insufficient process), and
MCR 2.116(C)(3) (insufficient service of process) “must be raise d
in a party’s first motion under [MCR 2.116] or in the party’ s
responsive pleading, whichever is filed first, or they are
waived.” MCR 2.116(D)(1). However, a general appearance doe s
not waive a party’s right to challenge the sufficiency of service of
process under MCR 2.116(C)(3). Al-Shimmari v Detroit Med Ctr,
477 Mich 280, 293 (2007).
2. Motions Based on (C)(4) or Governmental Immunity
Motions based on MCR 2.116(C)(4) (lack of subject matter
jurisdiction) and those based on governmental immunity “may

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
be raised at any time, regardless of whether the motion is filed
after the expiration of the period in which to file dispositive
motions under a scheduling order entered pursuant to MCR
2.401.” MCR 2.116(D)(3).
3. Motions Based on (C)(5), (C)(6), and (C)(7)
Motions based on MCR 2.116(C)(5) (plaintiff lacks standing),
MCR 2.116(C)(6) (another action exists between same parties o n
the same claim), or MCR 2.116(C)(7) (claim is barred) “must b e
raised in a party’s responsive pleading, unless the grounds are
stated in a motion filed under [MCR 2.116] prior to the party’s
first responsive pleading.” MCR 2.116(D)(2).
4. Motions Based on (C)(8), (C)(9), and (C)(10)
Motions based on MCR 2.116(C)(8) (failure to state a claim),
MCR 2.116(C)(9) (failure to state a valid defense), or MCR
2.116(C)(10) (no genuine issue of material fact) “may be raised a t
any time, unless a period in which to file dispositive motions i s
established under a scheduling order entered pursuant to MCR
8
2.401.” MCR 2.116(D)(4). It is at the court’s discretion whethe r
to consider a motion filed after such period. Id.
Generally, motions based on MCR 2.116(C)(10) should not be
filed until discovery is completed. Colista v Thomas, 241 Mic h
App 529, 537 (2000). However, the motion may be granted whe n
“there is no reasonable chance that further discovery will resul t
in factual support for the nonmoving party.” Id. at 537-538 .
“Mere speculation that additional discovery might produce
evidentiary support is not sufficient.” Caron v Cranbrook E d
Comm, 298 Mich App 629, 646 (2012) (summary disposition i n
favor of defendants was not premature where plaintiffs could
point to no prospective evidence to support their position, and
9
there was not a fair chance of such evidence existing).
5. Filing, Service, and Hearing Deadlines
Unless MCR 2.116(G) specifically provides otherwise, MCR
2.119 governs summary disposition motions. See MCR
2.119(G)(1).
8Defendants are not required to wait until a plaintiff “first move[s] to certify [a] class under MC R
3.501(B)(1)” before moving “for summary disposition of . . . class action claims under MCR 2.116(C)(8)[.] ”
Rodriguez v Hirshberg Acceptance Corp, 341 Mich App 349, 363 (2022).
9See Section 4.2(D)(2) regarding amendment of pleadings following the denial of a motion based on MC R
2.116(C)(8)-(10).

Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
The motion, brief, and any affidavits must be filed and served 21
days before the hearing, unless the court orders otherwise. MCR
2.116(G)(1)(a)(i).
A response to the motion, brief, and any affidavits must be filed
and served at least 7 days before the hearing, unless the cour t
sets a different time. MCR 2.116(G)(1)(a)(ii).
The moving party may file a reply brief in support of the motion;
reply briefs must be confined to rebuttal of arguments in the
nonmoving party’s response brief and cannot exceed five pages.
MCR 2.116(G)(1)(a)(iii). A reply brief must be filed and served a t
least four days before the hearing. Id. “[N]o additional or
supplemental briefs may be filed without leave of the court.”
MCR 2.116(G)(1)(a)(iv).
“[T]he hearing on a motion brought by a party asserting a clai m
shall not take place until at least 28 days after the opposing party
was served with the pleading stating the claim.” MCR
2.116(B)(2).

B. Grounds
A summary disposition motion must specify the grounds on which i t
is based. MCR 2.116(C). However, “where a party brings a motion fo r
summary disposition under the wrong subrule, a trial court ma y
proceed under the appropriate subrule if neither party is misled. ”
Computer Network, Inc v AM Gen Corp, 265 Mich App 309, 312 (2005).
Accordingly, in Black v Cook, 346 Mich App 121, 130 (2023), the Cour t
of Appeals held that “[d]espite [defendant’s] failure to specify th e
subrule under which she sought summary disposition, because th e
substance of her motion and accompanying brief indicated that th e
motion sought dismissal for failure to state a claim against defendant s
upon which relief could be granted, the trial court could consider,
address, and decide the motion as if specifically brought under MCR
2.116(C)(8).”
“The parties . . . may submit an agreed-upon stipulation of facts to the
court.” MCR 2.116(A)(1).
Committee Tip:
Trial courts should specify the subrule of MCR
2.116(C) relied on when granting or denying a
motion for summary disposition. This will assist

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
the appellate court in determining which
standard to apply and what evidence to consider.
11
1. (C)(1): Lack of Jurisdiction Over Person or Property
Summary disposition may be granted where “[t]he court lack s
jurisdiction over the person or property.” MCR 2.116(C)(1). A
motion for summary disposition based on the lack of personal
jurisdiction is resolved based on the pleadings and the evidence,
12
including affidavits. Lease Acceptance Corp v Adams, 272 Mich
App 209, 218 (2006). The burden of establishing jurisdiction is o n
the plaintiff. MCR 2.116(G)(5); Lease Acceptance Corp, 272 Mich
App at 218.
2. (C)(2): Insufficient Process
Summary disposition may be granted where “[t]he proces s
issued in the action was insufficient.” MCR 2.116(C)(2). “When
ruling on a motion brought under MCR 2.116(C)(2), the trial
court must consider the pleadings, affidavits, and other
documentary evidence submitted by the parties.” Richards v
13
McNamee, 240 Mich App 444, 448 (2000). See also MCR
2.116(G)(5).
3. (C)(3): Insufficient Service of Process
Summary disposition may be granted where “[t]he service of
process was insufficient.” MCR 2.116(C)(3). If the defendan t
actually receives service of process within the life of the
summons, the fact that the manner of service was improper i s
not grounds for dismissal. Hill v Frawley, 155 Mich App 611, 61 3
14
(1986), citing MCR 2.105(K)(3). “[MCR 2.105(K)(3)] forgive s
errors in the manner or content of service of process. It does no t
forgive a failure to serve process.” Holliday v Townley, 189 Mic h

App 424, 426 (1991). Dismissal is warranted only where there is a
15
complete failure of service of process. Id. at 425-426.
If a party submits any affidavits with the pleadings, depositions,
admissions, or other documentary evidence, the trial court mus t
consider these documents when ruling on a motion pursuant t o
16
MCR 2.116(C)(3). MCR 2.116(G)(5).
The court may order an immediate trial for summary motion s
based on MCR 2.116(C)(3). MCR 2.116(I)(3). A jury trial is no t
required to determine whether service of process was sufficient.
Al-Shimmari v Detroit Med Ctr, 477 Mich 280, 288-289 (2007). The
court may decide whether to hold a jury trial or a bench trial o n
MCR 2.116(C)(3) motions. Al-Shimmari, 477 Mich at 289-290.
4. (C)(4): Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction
Summary disposition may be granted where “[t]he court lack s
jurisdiction of the subject matter.” MCR 2.116(C)(4). “Whethe r
subject-matter jurisdiction exists is a question of law for the
court.” Dep’t of Natural Resources v Holloway Constr Co, 191 Mic h
App 704, 705 (1991). The court must consider the pleadings,
affidavits, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence
17
submitted by the parties. MCR 2.116(G)(5).
In an appeal regarding a motion for summary disposition under
MCR 2.116(C)(4), the reviewing court “must determine whether
the pleadings demonstrate that the defendant was entitled t o
judgment as a matter of law, or whether the affidavits and other
proofs show that there was no genuine issue of material fact.”
Sun Communities v Leroy Twp, 241 Mich App 665, 668 (2000).
Accordingly, “when deciding a motion for summary dispositio n
under MCR 2.116(C)(4), which requires a court to consider
evidence in the record, a circuit court must go beyond the
pleadings to determine whether the amount in controversy
could not exceed $25,000.” Rodriguez v Hirshberg Acceptance Corp,
341 Mich App 349, 365 (2022).
Where a plaintiff has failed to exhaust all available
administrative remedies, summary disposition for lack of
jurisdiction may be granted under MCR 2.116(C)(4). Citizens for

(2000).
“Subject-matter jurisdiction is a prerequisite for a court to hear
and decide a claim.” Core Values Constr, LLC v Sheehan's on the
18
Green, Inc, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up). In Cor e
Values, plaintiff’s “fatally defective claim for foreclosure of a
construction lien named only the parents as defendants, wherea s
its claim for breach of contract named only [Sheehan’s] and th e
son as defendants.” Id. at ___ (noting “the settled principle tha t
deceased people generally cannot be sued in their individual
capacity”). The Court of Appeals concluded that “lien-
foreclosure claims must be addressed in the circuit court, but the
lien-foreclosure claim in this case was pleaded solely against the
deceased parents, and then properly dismissed by the trial cour t
because the construction lien was invalid.” Id. at ___. However,
the “decision to affirm the award of summary disposition under
MCR 2.116(C)(4) [did] not bar [plaintiff] from pursuing its claim
for breach of contract . . . in district court.” Core Values, ___ Mic h
App at ___. “While a dismissal on the ground the court has n o
jurisdiction of the subject matter is a conclusive determination of
want of subject-matter jurisdiction, it is no adjudication of the
merits and will not bar another action for the same cause.” Id. a t
___ (cleaned up).
“[A]n award of summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(4)
results in a dismissal without prejudice.” Core Values, ___ Mich
App at ___. “Consequently, the award of summary dispositio n
under MCR 2.116(C)(4) leaves the whole subject of litigation a s
much open to another suit as if no suit had ever been brought.”
Core Values, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “The parents were named as defendants in both th e
construction-lien-foreclosure claim and the unjust-enrichmen t
claim, so the trial court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over the
construction-lien-foreclosure claim against them could suppor t
the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction over the unjust-
enrichment claim against them.” Id. at ___ (reasoning tha t
plaintiff “could not sue the parents for unjust enrichmen t
because they were both deceased; [plaintiff] could only sue their
estates”). “The son and [Sheehan’s] were not named a s
defendants in the lien-foreclosure claim, so the trial court had n o
basis to exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over the unjust-
enrichment claim against them.” Id. at ___. “Thus, the trial cour t
appropriately granted summary disposition to the son and
[Sheehan’s] under MCR 2.116(C)(4) as a threshold matter, and s o
the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to address the
18 See Section 2.2 on subject matter jurisdiction.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-13
=== Page 228 ===
Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
merits of the unjust-enrichment claim against the son and
[Sheehan’s].” Core Values, ___ Mich App at ___ (holding tha t
plaintiff “may file a claim for unjust enrichment against those
two defendants in district court, which will have subject-matter
jurisdiction to decide that claim on the merits”) (citatio n
omitted).
5. (C)(5): Lack of Legal Capacity to Sue
“A motion is properly granted pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(5)
when the party asserting the claim lacks the legal capacity t o
sue.” Ruggiero v Unnamed Genesee Co Pub Body, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up). “When reviewing such a motion,
[the court] must consider the pleadings, depositions,
admissions, affidavits, and other documentary evidence
submitted by the parties.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks an d
19
citation omitted).
While “standing to sue and capacity to sue are two distinc t
concepts,” the Michigan Court of Appeals “has consistentl y
affirmed the grant of summary disposition due to lack of
standing under [MCR 2.116(C)(5)].” Ruggiero, ___ Mich App a t
___ (finding no caselaw that “explicitly states that MCR
2.116(C)(5) cannot be used as a basis to grant summar y
disposition when a party lacks standing”).
Committee Tip:
Standing and capacity to sue are distinct
concepts. However, a motion challenging
standing might be properly considered under
MCR 2.116(C)(5). See Miller v Chapman
Contracting, 477 Mich 102, 104 (2007); UAW v
Central Mich Univ Trustees, 295 Mich App 486,
493-497 (2012). Real-party-in-interest is another
distinct concept. However, a motion based on a
real-party-in-interest defense should be
considered under MCR 2.116(C)(8) or MC R
2.116(C)(10). See Leite v Dow Chem Co, 43 9
Mich 920 (1992). See Section 2.15 for more
information on standing and real-party-in-
interest.
19“Affidavits, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence offered in support of or in opposition to
a motion based on [MCR 2.116(C)(5)] shall only be considered to the extent that the content or substance
would be admissible as evidence to establish or deny the grounds stated in the motion.” MCR 2.116(G)(6).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
6. (C)(6): Another Action Exists Between the Same
Parties Involving the Same Claim
“Summary disposition is appropriate when ‘[a]nother action has
been initiated between the same parties involving the same
claim.’” Dairyland Ins Co v Mews, 347 Mich App 568, 585 (2023),
quoting MCR 2.116(C)(6). See also Valeo Switches & Detection Sys ,
Inc v EMCom, Inc, 272 Mich App 309, 319-320 (2006). Th e
purpose of this rule is to prevent endless litigation of the same
20
claim by the same parties. Id. Summary disposition “cannot b e
granted under MCR 2.116(C)(6) unless there is another actio n
between the same parties involving the same claims currently
initiated and pending at the time of the decision regarding th e
motion for summary disposition.” Dairyland, 347 Mich App a t
585 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “[T]he term ‘same
parties’ in the court rule does not require complete identity as t o
all parties in each lawsuit; rather, it only requires the movin g
party and the opposing party to be the same.” Id. at 586. Pu t
differently, “the ‘same parties’ language of MCR 2.116(C)(6)
requires that relevant parties, i.e., the moving and opposing
party, be the exact same in both actions.” Dairyland, 347 Mich
App at 587. The Court of Appeals rejected plaintiff’s argumen t
that a defendant “was a ‘party’ for purposes of MCR 2.116(C)(6)
merely” because it “had an interest that would be affected by the
[circuit court] case and participated in discovery.” Dairyland, 347
Mich App at 588. The Court further held that “even though
[defendant] was central to [plaintiff’s] request for declaratory
relief in the [circuit court] case, participated extensively i n
discovery, and would be affected by the outcome, these facts did
not make [defendant] a ‘party’ to the original action” unde r
MCR 2.116(C)(6). Dairyland, 347 Mich App at 589.
The court must consider any affidavits, pleadings, depositions,
admissions, or other documentary evidence when ruling on a
21
motion pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(6). MCR 2.116(G)(5).
Summary disposition may occur even where the other actio n
initiated between the parties was not filed in Michigan. Vale o
Switches, 272 Mich App at 319. However, the Court of Appeal s
noted “that it might be appropriate, when dismissing a case
20 See Section 2.17 regarding res judicata and collateral estoppel.
21“Affidavits, depositions, admissions, and documentary evidence offered in support of or in opposition to
a motion based on [MCR 2.116(C)(6)] shall only be considered to the extent that the content or substance
would be admissible as evidence to establish or deny the grounds stated in the motion.” MCR 2.116(G)(6).

Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
under MCR 2.116(C)(6), to do so without prejudice in the even t
that the foreign court’s jurisdiction is disputed, an issue such a s
forum non conveniens arises, or the case is dismissed o n
grounds other than its merits.” Valeo Switches, 272 Mich App a t
319 (emphasis added).
Before dismissing claims under MCR 2.116(C)(6), the trial cour t
must specifically identify which claims are being dismissed and
which claims are already pending in another action. Planet Bingo ,
LLC v VKGS, LLC, 319 Mich App 308, 326-327 (2017) (noting tha t
the dismissal was proper “on its face” where there was an actio n
pending in a Nebraska court that involved the same claims and
parties, but remanding for additional fact-finding because it wa s
not clear from the record whether the trial court considered all of
the plaintiffs’ claims). On remand, the Court required the trial
court to order the parties “to make a record of what claims are
then pending in the Nebraska action (or on appeal in Nebraska)
and to subsequently address—on an individual basis—the issue
of whether summary disposition of each claim involved in thi s
action is appropriate under MCR 2.116(C)(6).” Planet Bingo, LLC,
319 Mich App at 326.
Further, “‘if there is another action pending and the part y
opposing the motion under MCR 2.116(C)(6) raises a questio n
regarding whether that suit can and will continue, a stay of the
second action pending resolution of the issue in the first actio n
should be granted.’” Planet Bingo, LLC, 319 Mich App at 327,
quoting Fast Air, Inc v Knight, 235 Mich App 541, 549 (1999)
(punctuation omitted).
7. (C)(7): Claim Is Barred by One of Several Grounds
Listed in the Subrule
Summary disposition may be granted where “[e]ntry of
judgment, dismissal of the action, or other relief is appropriate
because of release, payment, prior judgment, immunity granted
by law, statute of limitations, statute of frauds, an agreement t o
arbitrate or to litigate in a different forum, infancy or other
disability of the moving party, or assignment or other
disposition of the claim before commencement of the action.”
MCR 2.116(C)(7).
A party is not required to submit any material in support of a
motion under MCR 2.116(C)(7); the motion can be evaluated o n
the pleadings alone. Maiden v Rozwood, 461 Mich 109, 119 (1999).
“The contents of the complaint are accepted as true unles s
contradicted by documentation submitted by the movant.” Id. “A
party may support a motion under MCR 2.116(C)(7) b y

affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary
22
evidence.” Maiden, 461 Mich at 119. “In reviewing the motion,
a court must review all documentary evidence submitted by the
parties, accepting as true the contents of the complaint unles s
affidavits or other appropriate documents specifically contradic t
them.” Yono v Dep’t of Transp (Yono I), 495 Mich 982, 982-98 3
(2014); see also MCR 2.116(G)(5). “If the movant properly
supports his or her motion by presenting facts that, if lef t
unrebutted, would show that there is no genuine issue of
material fact that the movant [is entitled to summary
disposition], the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to presen t
evidence that establishes a question of fact.” Yono v Dep’t o f
Transp (On Remand) (Yono II), 306 Mich App 671, 679-680 (2014),
23
rev’d on other grounds, 499 Mich 636 (2016). “If the trial cour t
determines that there is a question of fact as to whether the
movant [is entitled to summary disposition], the court mus t
deny the motion.” Yono II, 306 Mich App at 680, citing Dextrom v
Wexford Co, 287 Mich App 406, 431 (2010).
“Unlike a motion under [MCR 2.116(C)(10)], a movant under
MCR 2.116(C)(7) is not required to file supportive material, an d
the opposing party need not reply with supportive material.”
Rowland v Detroit, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Further, in a (C)(7) motion the
contents of the complaint must be accepted as true unles s
specifically contradicted by the affidavits or other appropriate
documentation submitted by the movant.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Where documentary evidence does
adequately contradict the complaint, however, a court is t o
employ the same burden-shifting analysis as with a (C)(10)
motion to determine whether the matter can go to trial.” Id. a t
___. See Emerzian v North Bros Ford Inc, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2024) (“the trial court did not err by granting defendant’ s
motion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint under MCR 2.116(C)(7)
in favor of arbitration” because “the language of the arbitratio n
provision in the parties’ lease agreement indicated the parties’
agreement to permissive arbitration of the claims plaintiff
brought.”)

8. (C)(8): Failure to State a Claim on Which Relief Can Be
Granted
Summary disposition may be granted where “[t]he opposing
party has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted.”
MCR 2.116(C)(8). When deciding a motion on this ground, a
court may consider only the parties’ pleadings. MCR 2.116(G)(5).
“[A]ll well-pleaded allegations are accepted as true, and
construed most favorably to the non-moving party.” Wade v
Dep’t of Corrections, 439 Mich 158, 162-163 (1992). “A mere
statement of a pleader’s conclusions and statements of law,
unsupported by allegations of fact, will not suffice to state a
cause of action.” Varela v Spanski, 329 Mich App 58, 79 (2019)
(plaintiff failed to plead facts in support of his claim but instead
made conclusory statements and conclusions of law). However,
“[a] plaintiff or counterplaintiff is not generally required to cit e
the specific statutory provision under which he is proceeding i n
order to state a claim.” City of Wayne v Miller, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2024). “Rather, pleadings need only contain factual
allegations sufficient to reasonably inform the adverse party of
the nature of the claims the adverse party is called on to defend.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up). A motion under MCR 2.116(C)(8) may be
granted only where the claims alleged are “so clearly
unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual developmen t
could possibly justify recovery.” Wade, 439 Mich at 163.
Note that (C)(8) motions are distinct from (C)(10) motions: (C)(8)
motions denounce a claim’s legal sufficiency and require the
court to consider evidence only from the pleadings, while
(C)(10) motions denounce a claim’s factual sufficiency and allow
the court to consider evidence beyond the pleadings. El-Khalil v
Oakwood Healthcare, Inc, 504 Mich 152, 159-160 (2019). Court s
should be careful to analyze the summary disposition motio n
under the correct standard. See id. “While the lack of an
allegation can be fatal under MCR 2.116(C)(8), the lack of
evidence in support of the allegation cannot.” Id. at 162 (“the
Court of Appeals erroneously conducted what amounted t o
analysis under MCR 2.116(C)(10) in deciding a motion unde r
MCR 2.116(C)(8) by requiring evidentiary support for plaintiff’ s
allegations rather than accepting them as true”).
The trial court did not consider evidence outside the pleading s
where the partnership agreement in dispute was attached to the
defendants’ reply brief, and the plaintiff’s complaint raised a
reasonable inference that plaintiff failed to attach the agreemen t
to the complaint because the defendants had destroyed the

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
“Therefore, the partnership agreement was part of the pleadings,
and although the trial court articulated the wrong standard
[(MCR 2.116(C)(10))], it did not actually consider evidence
outside the pleadings in deciding defendants’ motion for
summary disposition. Varela, 329 Mich App at 69-70.
9. (C)(9): Failure to State a Valid Defense
Summary disposition may be granted where “[t]he opposing
party has failed to state a valid defense to the claim asserted
against him or her.” MCR 2.116(C)(9). This motion tests the legal
sufficiency of a pleaded defense to determine whether the
defense is “‘so clearly untenable that as a matter of law n o
factual development could possibly deny the plaintiff’s right t o
recovery.’” Vayda v Lake Co, 321 Mich App 686, 693 (2017),
quoting Abela v Gen Motors Corp, 257 Mich App 513, 518 (2003).
When deciding a motion on this ground, “the trial court may
only consider the pleadings, which include complaints, answers,
and replies, but not the motion for summary disposition itself.”
Ingham Co v Mich Co Rd Comm Self-Ins Pool, 321 Mich App 574 ,
579 (2017); MCR 2.116(G)(5). Summary disposition i s
inappropriate on this ground when a material allegation of the
complaint is categorically denied and the nonmoving party ha s
stated a legally cognizable defense. Dimondale v Grable, 240 Mic h
App 553, 564-565 (2000).
10.(C)(10): No Genuine Issue as to Any Material Fact
Exists
Summary disposition may be granted where “[e]xcept as to the
amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material
fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment or partial
judgment as a matter of law.” MCR 2.116(C)(10). This motio n
24
tests the factual sufficiency of the complaint. “A (C)(10) motio n
‘must specifically identify the issues as to which the moving
party believes there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,’
and assuming the required documentary support is provided,
‘an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or
denials of his or her pleading, but must, by affidavits or a s
otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing
that there is a genuine issue for trial.’” Rowland v Detroit, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2025), quoting MCR 2.116(G)(4). “It is, i n
24 Note that (C)(10) motions are distinct from (C)(8) motions: (C)(8) motions denounce a claim’s legal
sufficiency and require the court to consider evidence only from the pleadings, while (C)(10) motion s
denounce a claim’s factual sufficiency and allow the court to consider evidence beyond the pleadings. El-
Khalil v Oakwood Healthcare, Inc, 504 Mich 152, 159-160 (2019). Courts should be careful to analyze th e
summary disposition motion under the correct standard. See id.

Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
other words, a burden-shifting system.” Rowland, ___ Mich Ap p
at ___. The moving party bears the initial burden of supporting
its position. Smith v Globe Life Ins Co, 460 Mich 446, 455 (1999) .
“For a (C)(10) motion, ‘[a]ffidavits, depositions, admissions, or
other documentary evidence in support of the grounds asserted
in the motion are required.’” Rowland, ___ Mich App at ___,
quoting MCR 2.116(G)(3)(b). “The burden then shifts to th e
opposing party to establish that a genuine issue of disputed fac t
exists. Where the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue
rests on a nonmoving party, the nonmoving party may not rely
on mere allegations or denials in pleadings, but must go beyond
the pleadings to set forth specific facts showing that a genuine
issue of material fact exists. If the opposing party fails to presen t
documentary evidence establishing the existence of a material
factual dispute, the motion is properly granted.” Smith, 460 Mich
at 455 (citations omitted; emphasis added).
“A party’s own testimony, standing alone, can be sufficient t o
establish a genuine question of fact.” Jewett v Mesick Consol Sc h
Dist, 332 Mich App 462, 476 (2020). “A conflict in the evidence
may generally only be removed from the trier of fact’ s
consideration if it is based on testimony that is essentially
impossible or is irreconcilably contradicted by unassailable and
objective record evidence.” Id. The “court cannot make finding s
of fact” “[i]n its review of the evidence.” Doster v Covenant
Medical Center, Inc, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2022). Accordingly, “whe n
a witness’s credibility is at issue, summary disposition i s
inappropriate.” Taylor Estate v Univ Physician Group, 329 Mic h
App 268, 284 (2019).
“[S]peculation isn’t enough to give rise to a genuine issue of
material fact.” Doster, ___ Mich at ___. It is not appropriate for
the court to consider whether a record “might be developed” i n
an attempt to give the nonmovant the benefit of reasonable
doubt. Smith, 460 Mich at 455 n 2. The reviewing court shoul d
evaluate a motion for summary disposition under MCR
2.116(C)(10) by considering the substantively admissibl e
evidence actually proffered in opposition to the motion. Smith,
460 Mich at 455 n 2; MCR 2.116(G)(6). A reviewing court may no t
employ a standard citing the mere possibility that the clai m
might be supported by evidence produced at trial. Smith, 46 0
Mich at 455 n 2. A promise is insufficient under the current cour t
rules. Id.
Material Considered. In evaluating a motion for summary
disposition on this ground, a trial court must consider any
affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and other
evidence submitted by the parties. MCR 2.116(G)(5). Thi s

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
evidence should be considered in the light most favorable to the
nonmoving party. Brown v Brown, 478 Mich 545, 551-552 (2007).
“To be considered for purposes of summary disposition under
MCR 2.116(C)(10), evidence supporting a party’s position mus t
be substantively admissible but need not be admissible in form.”
Wehner v Tri-Hospital Emergency Med Servs Corp, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2025), citing MCR 2.116(G)(6) and Barnard Mfg Co, Inc v
Gates Performance Engineering, Inc, 285 Mich App 362, 373 (2009).
“Consequently, the party relying on the evidence does not have
to lay a foundation for admission of the evidence for the trial
court to consider it on a motion for summary disposition as long
as there was a plausible basis for admission of the evidence.”
Wehner, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
Party Responsible for Presenting Material. In a motion fo r
summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), “[t]he moving
party may . . . satisfy its burden . . . by submitting affirmative
evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving
party’s claim, or by demonstrating to the court that th e
nonmoving party’s evidence is insufficient to establish a n
essential element of the nonmoving party’s claim.” Lowrey v
LMPS & LMPJ, Inc, 500 Mich 1, 7 (2016) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). Accordingly, the moving party is “not required
to go beyond showing the insufficiency of [the nonmoving
party’s] evidence.” Id. at 3, 9 (holding that “in order to obtai n
summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), defendant wa s
not required to present proof that it lacked notice of the
hazardous condition, but needed only to show that plaintiff
presented insufficient proof to establish the notice element of her
claim”).
If the motion for summary disposition is properly made and
supported, an adverse party must, by affidavit or otherwise, “se t
forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.”
MCR 2.116(G)(4). If the adverse party fails to respond, and if
appropriate, the court must grant the summary dispositio n
motion. MCR 2.116(G)(4).
Where “the opposing party fails to present any evidence” i n
response to a motion for summary disposition under MCR
2.116(C)(10), “the motion is properly granted because n o
genuine issue of material fact exists.” Cleveland v Hath, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted). I n
Cleveland, ___ Mich App at ___, the “plaintiff assert[ed] that h e
should not have lost the case as a sanction for missing the
deadline in the scheduling order for filing a response t o
defendants’ summary disposition motions.” “[T]he failure to file

Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
a timely brief in response to a dispositive motion is not, by itself,
grounds for dismissal as a sanction”; however, “if a motion for
summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) challenges the
existence of any genuine issue of material fact and the opposing
party fails to timely present evidence in response, then the
motion may be properly granted on the merits.” Cleveland, __ _
Mich App at ___. “Here, the trial court not only established
deadlines for motion practice, but also cautioned the partie s
in . . . its scheduling order: ‘If you do not submit a timely brief,
the Court will assume that there is no legal or factual support for
your position.’” Id. at ___. “That language seems consistent wit h
the well-settled proposition that the reviewing court should
evaluate a motion for summary disposition under MCR
2.116(C)(10) by considering the substantively admissibl e
evidence actually proffered in opposition to the motion”—“the
trial court’s scheduling order appears compatible with tha t
standard because the scheduling order . . . obligates the party
opposing a summary disposition motion to present evidence
and arguments to fend off a motion for relief under MCR
2.116(C)(10).” Cleveland, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up) .
“[D]efendants’ motions shifted the burden to plaintiff to presen t
evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact,” and “[b]y
neglecting to submit timely responses to the motions, plaintiff
failed to carry that burden, so the trial court properly awarded
relief to defendants under MCR 2.116(C)(10).” Cleveland, __ _
Mich App at ___.
Affidavit Contradicting Earlier Deposition Testimony. “[A]
party may not raise an issue of fact by submitting an affidavi t
that contradicts the party’s prior clear and unequivocal
[deposition] testimony.” Palazzola v Karmazin Prod Corp, 223 Mich
App 141, 155 (1997).
Self-Conflicting Testimony. “[A] party may provide an affidavi t
to explain, clarify, or expand upon deposition testimony,
especially where the deposition testimony was no t
unequivocal.” Bakeman v Citizens Ins Co, 344 Mich App 66, 7 7
(2022) (adopting a case-by-case approach when analyzing
arguably inconsistent deposition testimony). “[W]hen a
deponent’s testimony is inherently self-contradictory, a cour t
may not, at the summary disposition stage of proceedings,
blindly assume that one statement is true and the other is false.
In the absence of an objective basis for concluding that one or the
other of the statements must have been the true statement, doing
so constitutes an impermissible credibility assessment.” Id. at 80.
Expert Affidavit. An affidavit that simply states an expert’ s
opinion, without providing any scientific or factual support,
may be insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.
Page 4-22 Michigan Judicial Institute

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
Travis v Dreis & Krump Mfg Co, 453 Mich 149, 174-175 (1996) (th e
affidavit was not factually or scientifically supported and
“merely parrot[ed] the language of the legal test”).
Contractual Interpretation. Summary disposition under MCR
2.116(C)(10) may be granted when the issues raised are merel y
those of contractual interpretation rather than factual dispute.
See Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, 432 Mich 656, 700 (1989).
Motive or Intent. “Michigan does not apply a rule precluding
summary disposition whenever a claim or defense involves a n
individual’s motive or intent.” Franks v Franks, 330 Mich App 69,
86 (2019). “To the extent that [Michigan Court of Appeals’s]
decisions seem to apply an absolute exception to the applicatio n
of summary disposition premised on the mere possibility that a
jury might disbelieve an essential witness, . . . the application of
that rule is limited to those situations where the moving part y
relies on subjective matters that are exclusively within the
knowledge of its own witness and those in which the witnes s
would have the motivation to testify to a version of events tha t
are favorable to the moving party.” Id. at 90-91 (where “plaintiff s
present[] evidence that if left unrebutted . . . establishe[s] tha t
defendants [acted] . . . with the requisite intent, . . . the trial cour t
could properly grant summary disposition on liability if
defendants [do] not establish a question of fact on the issue of
intent”).
C. Unavailability of Affidavits
A party may present an affidavit to establish “that the facts necessar y
to support the party’s position cannot be presented because the fact s
are known only to persons whose affidavits a party cannot procure. ”
MCR 2.116(H). See also Brooks v Reed, 93 Mich App 166, 174 (1979),
where the defendant was unable to present an affidavit on the facts
because “the specific evidential facts concerning the nature o f
plaintiff’s injuries and treatment [stemming from an automobil e
accident] were within the personal knowledge of only the plaintiff
and [her doctor].” (Citation omitted.) The Michigan Court of Appeal s
concluded that under such circumstances, the defendant may b e
excused from presenting the material facts by filing an affidavit unde r
what is now MCR 2.116(H). Brooks, 93 Mich App at 174.
The party’s affidavit must include (1) the names of the people whos e
affidavits the party cannot procure, (2) a statement as to why th e
party cannot procure the testimony, and (3) a statement as to “th e
nature of the probable testimony of these persons and the reason fo r
the party‘s belief that these persons would testify to those facts. ”
MCR 2.116(H)(1)(a)-(b).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-23
=== Page 238 ===
Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Once the party has filed a conforming affidavit, “the court may ente r
an appropriate order, including an order
(a) denying the motion, or
(b) allowing additional time to permit the affidavit to b e
supported by further affidavits, or by depositions,
answers to interrogatories, or other discovery.” MCR
2.116(H)(2)(a)-(b).
D. Possible Dispositions
Outcomes for summary disposition motions include:
• judgment for the moving party, MCR 2.116(I)(1);
• judgment for the nonmoving party, MCR 2.116(I)(2);
• an immediate trial on disputed issues, subject to the
requirements in MCR 2.116(I)(3);
• postpone hearing and decision on the matters until trial,
MCR 2.116(I)(4); or
• where the grounds are based on MCR 2.116(C)(8), MCR
2.116(C)(9), or MCR 2.116(C)(10), and justification exists ,
an opportunity to amend the pleadings, MCR 2.116(I)(5).
1. Immediate Trial
“A court may, under proper circumstances, order immediate trial
to resolve any disputed issue of fact, and judgment may be
entered forthwith if the proofs show that a party is entitled t o
judgment on the facts as determined by the court. An immediate
trial may be ordered if the grounds asserted are based on [MCR
2.116(C)(1)] through [MCR 2.116(C)(6)], or if the motion is based
on [MCR 2.116(C)(7)] and a jury trial as of right has not bee n
demanded on or before the date set for hearing. If the motion i s
based on [MCR 2.116(C)(7)] and a jury trial has been demanded ,
the court may order immediate trial, but must afford the partie s
a jury trial as to issues raised by the motion as to which there is a
right to trial by jury.” MCR 2.116(I)(3).
Where the summary disposition motion is not based on MCR
2.116(C)(1)-(7), the court may not order an immediate trial. Swee t
Air Investment, Inc v Kenney, 275 Mich App 492, 505 (2007). I t
must provide notice to the plaintiff and allow him or her a n
opportunity to present any objections. Id. at 505.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
2. Amendment of Pleadings
If a summary disposition motion is based on MCR 2.116(C)(8),
MCR 2.116(C)(9), or MCR 2.116(C)(10), the court must give th e
parties an opportunity to amend their pleadings as provided i n
25
MCR 2.118, unless evidence before the court shows that a n
amendment would be unjustified. MCR 2.116(I)(5). “Th e
question, then, is how trial courts must implement tha t
requirement.” Reeves v Wayne Co, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025)
(noting that “the rule is not specific on the order of the rulings”)
(cleaned up). “Courts have implemented the rule in a variety of
legitimate ways.” Id. at ___. “The usual practice is to enter a
conditional order stating that summary disposition is granted
unless an amended pleading is filed by a certain time.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “However, nothing
forbids a court from allowing an amendment even after granting
summary disposition if the amendment is sufficient.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
“There is little dispute that the opportunity to amend a pleading
under MCR 2.116(I)(5) generally applies only when a motio n
under MCR 2.116(C)(8) has merit.” Reeves, ___ Mich App at ___.
In Reeves, the trial court granted defendants’ motion for
summary disposition of plaintiff’s claims under the Michiga n
Constitution for failure to state a viable cause of action bu t
“denied summary disposition as to the remaining claims and
noted that plaintiff would be permitted to amend his Complain t
to allege intentional torts with more particularity.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up). However, “the trial court never clearly ruled o n
their [MCR 2.116(C)(8)] arguments.” Reeves, ___ Mich App a t
___. “Even so, if the motion had merit, plaintiff would have bee n
entitled to amend his complaint under MCR 2.116(I)(5)—whic h
[was] precisely what the trial court allowed.” Reeves, ___ Mic h
App at ___ (“Importantly, plaintiff filed an amended complain t
after these appeals were initiated.”). “In sum, defendant s
received the procedural remedy they claim was denied.” Id. at
___. “If they believe the amended complaint still fails to state a
claim, the proper course is to raise those arguments in the trial
court on remand.” Id. at ___ (rejecting defendants’ argument tha t
“the trial court should have granted their motion for summary
disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and then permitted plaintif f
to seek leave to amend his complaint”). “Defendants’ assertio n
that the rule mandates a particular sequence is not supported by
the text or case law.” Id. at ___. “Reported decisions reflect tha t
flexibility.” Id. at ___; see Codd v Wayne Co, 210 Mich App 133,
137 (1995) (finding it sufficient that “the trial court, in lieu of
25 See Section 3.7 on amendment of pleadings.

Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
requiring plaintiffs to file formally an amended complaint,
allowed the parties to present supplemental briefs”); ABB Paint
Finishing, Inc v Nat’l Union Fire Ins Co, 223 Mich App 559, 564
(1997) (observing that a plaintiff could “request[] leave to amend
its complaint before the trial court rules on a motion under
[MCR 2.116(C)(8)],” which “the trial court should normally
allow” under MCR 2.116(I)(5)).
A party is not entitled to the opportunity to amend their
pleadings as a matter of right under MCR 2.116(I)(5) if “the trial
court decide[s] to award summary disposition under MCR
2.116(C)(7) as well as MCR 2.116(C)(10) . . . .” Hamood v Trinit y
Health Corp, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). However, “[t]h e
omission of MCR 2.116(C)(7) from the language in MCR
2.116(I)(5) affording parties the largely unfettered right t o
amend their pleadings after an award of summary dispositio n
under MCR 2.116(C)(8), [MCR 2.116(C)(9)], or [MCR
2.116(C)(10) does] not absolutely bar the trial court fro m
granting [a] motion to amend [a] complaint.” Hamood, ___ Mich
App at ___.
“A plaintiff or counterplaintiff is not generally required to cite
the specific statutory provision under which he is proceeding i n
order to state a claim.” City of Wayne v Miller, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2024). “Rather, pleadings need only contain factual
allegations sufficient to reasonably inform the adverse party of
the nature of the claims the adverse party is called on to defend.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up). Where a party does not seek leave of th e
court or obtain the opposing party’s consent to amend his or her
pleading, “MCR 2.116(I)(5) [does] not require the court to su a
sponte offer [the party] an opportunity to amend.” Kloian v
Schwartz, 272 Mich App 232, 242 (2006) (finding no plain error i n
these circumstances).
“[A]n amendment is not justified if it would be futile.” Ligget t
Restaurant Group, Inc v Pontiac, 260 Mich App 127, 138 (2003).
“[L]eave to amend should ordinarily be denied only for
particularized reasons such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory
motive, repeated failures to cure by amendments previously
allowed, or futility.” Bennett v Russell, 322 Mich App 638, 64 7
(2018) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“The Michigan Court Rules are generous with respect to the
filing of amended complaints, and the joinder or substitution of
parties.” C-Spine Orthopedics, LLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, __ _
Mich ___, ___ (2025), citing MCR 2.118(A)(2), MCR 2.116(I)(5),
MCR 2.207, and MCR 2.202(D). “However, the court rules als o
empower a trial court to deny such relief if it would be unjust.”
Id. at ___, citing Weymers, 454 Mich at 658, and MCR 2.207
Page 4-26 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 241 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.2
(noting that MCR 2.118(A)(3) allows “a trial court to requir e
reimbursement of additional expenses, including reasonable
attorney fees, from a party whose ‘inexcusable delay’ i n
requesting leave to amend caused an adverse party to incur
these expenses”). “These provisions provide trial courts ample
authority and discretion to punish misconduct, gamesmanship,
or delay by plaintiffs, while still allowing the amendment of
pleadings under the appropriate circumstances.” C-Spine, __ _
Mich at ___.
While undue delay alone “does not warrant denial of a motio n
to amend,” “the leeway granted to a plaintiff to amend a
complaint is not a license for carelessness or gamesmanship.” Id.
at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted) (“characteriz[ing]
plaintiff’s failure to act for years as undue delay that foreclosed
leave to amend”). In Hamood, plaintiff sought to amend he r
complaint after defendant obtained summary disposition of all
her pending claims under MCR 2.116(C)(7) and MCR
2.116(C)(10). Hamood, ___ Mich App at ___. “But by her own
admission, plaintiff had the opportunity for years in federal
court and then in state court to request leave to add her claim for
breach of contract against [defendant], yet she failed to do s o
because ‘it fell through the cracks somehow or something[.]’” Id.
at ___. The court considered the “added costs, complications,
and challenges” associated with defense of the new claim,
including “additional rounds of discovery, in all probability
interview of new witnesses, gathering of further evidence, and
the identification of appropriate legal arguments” and “did no t
abuse its discretion by denying plaintiff leave to amend her
complaint.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
A trial court’s decision whether to grant leave to amend a
pleading is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Ormsby v Capita l
Welding, Inc, 471 Mich 45, 53 (2004). “[A] court must specify it s
reasons for denying the motion [to amend the pleading]; a
failure to do so requires reversal, unless amendment would be
futile.”Noyd v Claxton, Morgan, Flockhart & Vanliere, 186 Mic h
App 333, 340 (1990).
E. Ordering Summary Disposition Sua Sponte
MCR 2.116 does not expressly require a motion to order summar y
disposition; the court may do so sua sponte. Boulton v Fenton Twp, 272
Mich App 456, 462-463 (2006), citing MCR 2.116(I). “Under MCR
2.116(I)(1), the court shall render judgment without delay in tw o
circumstances: if the pleadings show that a party is entitled t o
judgment as a matter of law, or if the affidavits or other proofs sho w
that there is no genuine issue of material fact.” Rowland v Detroit, __ _
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-27
=== Page 242 ===
Section 4.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up). “The rule mandates that if on e
of two conditions is met, then the court shall render judgmen t
without delay.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up) (noting “there is no principled
reason to distinguish between which one of the two conditions in th e
rule is met”) (cleaned up). “Indeed, not only is a court permitted t o
grant summary disposition in these instances, the word ‘shall’ in th e
court rules makes this a mandatory action once the court ha s
determined that a party is entitled to judgment and there is n o
genuine issue of material fact.” Id. at ___ n 7 (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
However, a trial court may not sua sponte grant summary dispositio n
in contravention of a party’s due process rights. Al-Maliki v LaGrant,
286 Mich App 483, 489 (2009). See also Lamkin v Hamburg Twp Bd o f
Trustees, 318 Mich App 546, 549-551 (2017). In a civil proceeding ,
notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard meet basic du e
process requirements. Al-Maliki, 286 Mich App at 485. “Where a cour t
considers an issue sua sponte, due process can be satisfied b y
affording a party with an opportunity for rehearing.” Id. at 485-486. I n
addition, “any error by a court in granting summary disposition su a
sponte without affording a party an adequate opportunity to brief a n
issue and present it to the court may be harmless under MCR
2.613(A), if the party is permitted to fully brief and present th e
argument in a motion for reconsideration.” Al-Maliki, 286 Mich Ap p
at 486.
F. Filing Multiple Summary Disposition Motions
“A party may file more than one motion under [MCR 2.116], subject t o
26
the provisions of [MCR 2.116(F)].” ”MCR 2.116(E)(3). “The denial o f
a motion for summary disposition does not preclude such a motio n
on the same ground from being granted later in the same case.” Ban k
of America, NA v Fidelity Nat’l Title Ins Co, 316 Mich App 480, 521-522
(2016) (holding that the trial court had authority to revisit and revers e
its previous denials of summary disposition and reconsideration afte r
the defendant raised the same issue again in another motion fo r
summary disposition).
G. Prejudicial Value
In deciding whether an order granting a motion for summar y
disposition “should be with or without prejudice, the trial cour t
should consider whether the doctrine of res judicata would ba r
26MCR 2.116(F) provides: “A party or an attorney found by the court to have filed a motion or an affidavi t
in violation of the provisions of MCR 1.109(D)(3) and [MCR 1.109(E)] may, in addition to the imposition of
other penalties prescribed by that rule, be found guilty of contempt.”

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.3
subsequent actions involving the same claim.” ABB Paint Finishing,
27
Inc v Nat’l Union Fire Ins Co, 223 Mich App 559, 562 (1997). “Where a
trial court dismisses a case on the merits, the plaintiff should not b e
allowed to refile the same suit against the same defendant and
dismissal should therefore be with prejudice.” Id. at 563.
“[S]ummary disposition under [MCR 2.116(C)(8)] is necessarily a
decision on the merits. To grant such a motion ‘without prejudice ’
is . . . equally incongruous. . . . Logically, then, a grant of summar y
disposition under [MCR 2.116(C)(8)] should always be wit h
prejudice.” ABB Paint Finishing, Inc, 223 Mich App at 563. However,
“[t]his conclusion does not . . . preclude a plaintiff from requesting
leave to amend its complaint [as permitted by MCR 2.116(I)(5)],
before the court rules on a motion under [MCR 2.116(C)(8)].” ABB
Paint Finishing, Inc, 223 Mich App at 563.
H. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision whether to grant summary disposition i s
reviewed de novo. Goldstone v Bloomfield Twp Pub Library, 479 Mic h
554, 558 (2007).
4.3 Reconsideration or Rehearing
A. Requirements
28
Unless a more specific court rule provides otherwise, a motion fo r
reconsideration or rehearing must be filed and served no later than 2 1
days after entry of order disposing of the motion. MCR 2.119(F)(1).
Responses and oral arguments are not permitted unless ordered b y
the court. MCR 2.119(F)(2).
“The moving party must demonstrate a palpable error by which th e
court and the parties have been misled and show that a differen t
disposition of the motion must result from correction of the error. ”
MCR 2.119(F)(3).
A motion for reconsideration or rehearing tolls the period of time i n
which a party may file a request for case-evaluation sanctions. See
MCR 2.405(D)(6)(iii); and MCR 2.625(F)(2). See also Section 6.5(J)(2).
27See Section 2.17 for a discussion of res judicata.
28 See, e.g., MCR 2.604(A) or MCR 2.612.

Section 4.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
B. Decision
“The purpose of MCR 2.119(F) is to allow a trial court to immediatel y
correct any obvious mistakes it may have made in ruling on a motion,
which would otherwise be subject to correction on appeal, but at a
much greater expense to the parties. The time requirement for filing a
motion for reconsideration or rehearing insures that the motion will
be brought expeditiously.” Bers v Bers, 161 Mich App 457, 462 (1987)
(at the time this case was decided, the time requirement was seve n
days) (citation omitted).
Generally, a motion for rehearing or reconsideration that merel y
presents the same issue ruled on by the court, either expressly or b y
reasonable implication, will not be granted. MCR 2.119(F)(3).
However, the decision whether to grant a motion for reconsideratio n
is within the court’s discretion. See id. Accordingly, MCR 2.119(F)(3)
“does not categorically prevent a trial court from revisiting an issu e
even when the motion for reconsideration presents the same issu e
already ruled upon; in fact, it allows considerable discretion to correc t
mistakes.” Macomb Co Dep’t of Human Servs v Anderson, 304 Mich Ap p
750, 754 (2014).
No abuse of discretion was found where the trial court denied a
plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration that rested “on a legal theory
and facts which could have been pled or argued prior to the trial
court’s original order” because the motion did not “demonstrate a
‘palpable error by which the court and the parties ha[d] bee n
misled.’” Charbeneau v Wayne Co Gen Hosp, 158 Mich App 730, 73 3
(1987), quoting MCR 2.119(F)(3).
“‘[R]ehearing [or reconsideration] will not be ordered on the ground
merely that a change of members of the bench has either taken place,
or is about to occur.’” Hoffman v Barrett, 493 Mich 964, 964 (2013),
quoting Peoples v Evening News Ass’n, 51 Mich 11, 21 (1883).
C. Standard of Review
A court’s decision to grant or deny a motion for reconsideration i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Kokx v Bylenga, 241 Mich Ap p
655, 658-659 (2000). The court also has discretion to limit it s
reconsideration to the issue it believes warrants further consideration.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.4
4.4 Revisiting a Judgment In Actions Involving Multiple
Claims or Multiple Parties
MCR 2.604(A) allows courts to revise orders before entry of a final
judgment in a case:
“Except as provided in [MCR 2.604(B), addressing
29
receiverships and similar actions ], an order or other form of
decision adjudicating fewer than all the claims, or the right s
and liabilities of fewer than all the parties, does not terminate
the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order i s
subject to revision before entry of final judgmen t
adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all
the parties. Such an order or other form of decision is no t
appealable as of right before entry of final judgment. A party
may file an application for leave to appeal from such a n
order.”
“As a general matter, courts are permitted to revisit issues the y
previously decided, even if presented with a motion for reconsideratio n
that offers nothing new to the court.” Bank of America, NA v Fidelity Nat’ l
Title Ins Co, 316 Mich App 480, 521 (2016) (quotation and citation
30
omitted). In Bank of America, NA, the trial court initially denied the
defendant’s motion for summary disposition and ultimately revisited it s
decision after the defendant filed another motion for summar y
disposition raising the same issue. Id. The plaintiff challenged the trial
court’s authority to alter its stance on the issue because it already denied
the defendant’s first motion for summary disposition and motion fo r
reconsideration. Id. The Court of Appeals, citing MCR 2.604(A), held tha t
“although the trial court exhibited a lack of awareness that it had
previously denied [the defendant’s] motion for reconsideration of th e
order denying [the defendant’s] first motion for summary disposition,
the trial court nonetheless had authority to revisit its previou s
determination regarding the applicability of the full credit bid rule. A
final judgment had not yet been entered, and [the defendant] had filed
another motion for summary disposition again raising the issue . . . a s
31
permitted by [MCR 2.116(E)(3)].” Bank of America, NA, 316 Mich App a t
522.
29MCR 2.604(B) provides: “In receivership and similar actions, the court may direct that an order entere d
before adjudication of all of the claims and rights and liabilities of all the parties constitutes a final order o n
an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.”
30For a discussion of reconsideration or rehearing, see Section 4.3.

2.116(E)(3).

Section 4.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
4.5 Security for Costs
A. Basis
On motion of a party who is defending a civil claim, the court ma y
order security for costs. MCR 2.109(A). Whether to require security i s
discretionary and requires a substantial reason. In re Surety Bond fo r
Costs, 226 Mich App 321, 331 (1997). “A ‘substantial reason’ fo r
requiring security may exist where there is a ‘tenuous legal theory o f
liability,’ or where there is good reason to believe that a party’ s
allegations are ‘groundless and unwarranted.’” Id. at 331-332, quoting
Hall v Harmony Hills Recreation, Inc, 186 Mich App 265, 270 (1990).
MCR 2.109 does not “prohibit[] a court from imposing bond on it s
own initiative.” Zapalski v Benton, 178 Mich App 398, 404-405 (1989)
(the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sua sponte orderin g
plaintiff to file security regarding certain claims that rested upo n
tenuous legal theories).
B. Timing
MCR 2.109 does not contain an express time limitation for requestin g
security for costs. Nevertheless, the parties should apply for securit y
as early as practicable. Hall v Harmony Hills Recreation, Inc, 186 Mich
App 265, 269 (1990). A party’s delay in bringing a motion for securit y
presumably would permit a trial court to consider laches in th e
exercise of its discretion whether to grant the requested relief.
Goodenough v Burton, 146 Mich 50, 52 (1906).
C. Hearing
The trial court is not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing to se t
a surety bond. Dunn v Emergency Physicians Med Grp, PC, 189 Mich
App 519, 523 (1991). A trial judge may set the bond in light of his or
her own experience. Belfiori v Allis-Chalmers, Inc, 107 Mich App 595,
601 (1981).
D. Exceptions
MCR 2.109(B) provides several circumstance in which security for
costs may not be ordered. For example, if the party’s pleading states a
legitimate claim, and shows by affidavit that he or she is financiall y
unable to furnish a security bond, financial inability is a basis fo r
proceeding without security. MCR 2.109(B)(1). This does no t
necessarily require a party to be indigent. Hall v Harmony Hills
Recreation, Inc, 186 Mich App 265, 272 (1990). In addition, variou s
government entities and employees are exempt from supplyin g
security for costs. MCR 2.109(B)(2).
Page 4-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 247 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.5
Courts may consider the party’s “likelihood of success” on a lega l
theory in determining the legitimacy of a claim. In re Surety Bond for
Costs, 226 Mich App 321, 333 (1997). The “‘legitimacy of the claim will
[not] always be determinative. The rule clearly allows for sound trial
court discretion. We can imagine few cases, however, where a discree t
trial court will require an indigent plaintiff, pleading a valid theory o f
liability, to post security.’” Hall, 186 Mich App at 272.
E. Objection to Sufficiency of Security
“MCR 3.604(E) and [MCR 3.604(F)] govern objections to the surety.”
MCR 2.109(A). “In an appeal to the circuit court from a lower court or
tribunal, an objection to the surety is heard in the circuit court.” MCR
3.604(F)(3).
Within seven days of receiving a copy of the bond, the moving part y
may “serve on the officer taking the bond and the party giving th e
bond a notice that the party objects to the sufficiency of the surety. ”
MCR 3.604(E). The notice “must be filed as a motion for hearing o n
objections to the bond.” MCR 3.604(F). Failure to provide notice of an
objection waives all objections. MCR 3.604(E).
“On demand of the objecting party, the surety must appear at th e
hearing of the motion and be subject to examination as to the surety’ s
pecuniary responsibility or the validity of the execution of the bond. ”
MCR 3.604(F)(1). “After the hearing, the court may approve or rejec t
the bond as filed or require an amended, substitute, or additional
bond, as the circumstances warrant.” MCR 3.604(F)(2). See also MCR
2.109(C).
F. Modification of Order
“The court may order new or additional security at any time on jus t
terms, (1) if the party of the surety moves out of Michigan, or (2) if th e
original amount of the bond proves insufficient. A person wh o
becomes a new or additional surety is liable for all costs from th e
commencement of the action, as if he or she had been the original
surety.” MCR 2.109(C).
G. Sanction
After giving a reasonable opportunity to comply with the orde r
requiring security, the court may dismiss the claim. In re Surety Bond
for Costs, 226 Mich App 321, 332 (1997).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-33

Section 4.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
H. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision whether to require a security bond is reviewed
for an abuse of discretion. In re Surety Bond for Costs, 226 Mich Ap p
321, 331 (1997).
The trial court’s decisions regarding the legitimacy of a claim and a
party’s financial ability to post bond are reviewed for clear error. In re
Surety Bond for Costs, 226 Mich App at 333.
4.6 Separate or Joint Trial
A. Court’s Discretion
MCR 2.505 allows the court to decide whether to consolidate or sever
trials:
“(A) Consolidation. When actions involving a
substantial and controlling common question of law o r
fact are pending before the court, it may
(1) order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the
matters in issue in the actions;
(2) order the actions consolidated; and
(3) enter orders concerning the proceedings t o
avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
(B) Separate Trials. For convenience or to avoid
prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive t o
expedition and economy, the court may order a separat e
trial of one or more claims, cross-claims, counterclaims,
third-party claims, or issues.”
“Consolidation should not be ordered if the substantial rights of a
party would be adversely affected or if juror confusion would result. ”
Bordeaux v Celotex Corp, 203 Mich App 158, 163-164 (1993). “The
decision to sever trials is within the trial judge’s discretion and should
be ordered only upon a most persuasive showing.” Hodgins v Times
Herald Co, 169 Mich App 245, 261 (1988).
The court rule does not prescribe time requirements.

4.7 Substitution or Withdrawal of Attorney
A. Order Required
“Unless otherwise stated in [MCR 2.117], an attorney who has entered
an appearance may withdraw from the action or be substituted fo r
only on order of the court.” MCR 2.117(C)(2). See also Coble v Green,
271 Mich App 382, 386-387 (2006).
[32]
“An attorney who has filed a notice of limited appearance
pursuant to MCR 2.117(B)(2)(c) and MRPC 1.2(b) may withdraw b y
filing a notice of withdrawal from limited appearance with the court,
served on all parties of record, stating that the attorney’s limited
representation has concluded and the attorney has taken all action s
necessitated by the limited representation, and providing to the cour t
a current service address and telephone number for the self-
represented litigant.” MCR 2.117(C)(4). The notice of withdrawal
from limited appearance is effective immediately upon filing an d
service if it is signed by the client; it is effective 14 days after filing and
service if it is not signed by the client, “unless the self-represented
client files and serves a written objection to the withdrawal on th e
grounds that the attorney did not complete the agreed upo n
services.” Id.
Where the court has ordered an attorney to continue representing a
client, the attorney must continue with the representation even i f
good cause exists for terminating the representation. MRPC 1.16(c).

4.8 Adjournments
A. Applicability
Trials, alternative dispute resolution processes, pretrial conferences,
and all motion hearings may be adjourned pursuant to MCR 2.503(A).
B. Requirements
A request for an adjournment must be by motion or stipulation, i n
writing or on the record, and based on good cause. MCR 2.503(B). Th e
request must include:
(1) Which party is requesting the adjournment. MCR
2.503(B)(2)(a).
(2) The reason for the adjournment. MCR 2.503(B)(2)(b).
(3) Whether other adjournments have been granted and,
if so, how many. MCR 2.503(B)(2)(c).
(4) A caption that specifies whether it is the first or a
subsequent request. MCR 2.503(B)(3).
Unavailability of a witness or evidence may be the basis fo r
requesting an adjournment. MCR 2.503(C). According to MCR
2.503(C):
(1) The request must be made as soon as possible afte r
knowledge. MCR 2.503(C)(1).
(2) The court must find:
• The evidence is material, and
• The party made diligent efforts in attempting t o
produce the witness or evidence. MCR 2.503(C)(2).
(3) If the adverse party stipulates in writing or on the
record to the evidence and the evidence would b e
admissible, an adjournment is not required. MCR
2.503(C)(3).
33The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(4) and
MCR 2.408(C)(4) to adjournments. See Section 1.15 for more information on videoconferencing.
Page 4-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 251 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.8
C. Order
The court “may grant an adjournment to promote the cause o f
justice.” Zerillo v Dyksterhouse, 191 Mich App 228, 230 (1991). MCR
2.503(D) requires the order to be in writing or on the record and t o
state the reason for granting the request. MCR 2.503(D)(1). The cour t
may impose costs and conditions. MCR 2.503(D)(2). An adjournmen t
may be vacated if nonpayment is shown by written statement verified
under MCR 1.109(D)(3). MCR 2.503(D)(2).
An adjournment (at least 28 days) must be ordered where an attorne y
in the case has died, become physically or mentally unable t o
continue in the case, been disbarred, been suspended, been placed o n
inactive status, or resigned from active membership in the bar. MCR
2.503(F).
“[T]o establish good cause in the context of a motion for a n
adjournment a party must show a legally sufficient or substantia l
reason.” Ypsilanti Twp v Dahabra, 338 Mich App 287, 292 (2021)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). In Dahabra, 338 Mich App a t
292, defendant was “an impoverished individual who thereby migh t
have some difficulty expeditiously obtaining counsel for a civi l
defense,” which was “a legally sufficient, substantial reason to see k
an adjournment.” Additionally, “the existence of [defendant’s ]
ongoing criminal case [(relating to the same conduct as defendant’ s
civil nuisance abatement case)] tended to support the necessity of a n
adjournment.” Id. at 294. “While a trial court need not in ever y
instance delay a civil abatement suit until after the criminal trial o n
the same facts is completed, the decision to proceed with or delay a
civil abatement suit must be tested against the equity and necessit y
for proceeding with the civil action under the circumstances of a
given case.” Id. at 295 (cleaned up). In light of the circumstance s
presented in Dahabra, there was “no valid reason for the trial court t o
have outrightly ignored defendant’s request for an adjournment i n
order to obtain counsel,” and “[t]he trial court’s decision simply did
not promote the cause of justice[.]” Id. at 295-296 (concluding that the
trial court’s “failure to consider defendant’s request for a n
adjournment constituted an abuse of discretion”).
D. Reschedule
The court must either reschedule the adjourned matter for a specifi c
date or “place the matter on a specified list of actions or other matter s
which will automatically reappear before the court on the firs t
available date.” MCR 2.503(E)(1)-(2).

Section 4.9 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
E. Conflict With Another Court
If a conflict with another court exists with regard to scheduled trial
dates, it is the attorney’s responsibility to notify the court. MCR
2.501(D)(2). If the parties or their attorneys cannot resolve the conflic t
by consulting with the individual courts, “the judges shall consul t
directly to resolve the conflict.” Id. Except where statute, court rule, or
special circumstances dictate otherwise, priority is given to the trial
set first. MCR 2.501(D)(3).
F. Standard of Review
The decision whether to grant a continuance or an adjournment i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Soumis v Soumis, 218 Mich Ap p
27, 32 (1996).
4.9 Stay of Proceedings
A. Bankruptcy Stay
Most state court proceedings will be automatically stayed as a resul t
of federal bankruptcy proceedings. 11 USC 362(a). Exceptions to a n
automatic stay can be found at 11 USC 362(b). Relief from a stay can
only be requested in the bankruptcy court. 11 USC 362(d).
The purpose of an automatic stay is to preserve the status quo of th e
estate, protect the debtor from other collection efforts by creating a
systematic liquidation proceeding, and ensure that all creditors o f
equal status are treated the same. Stackpoole v Dep’t of Treasury, 19 4
Mich App 112, 116 (1992).
Notice of Bankruptcy Proceedings in State Court Action. MCR 2.421
“provides a process for filing notice of a bankruptcy proceeding tha t
affects a state court action.” ADM File No. 2021-50 (staff comment).
However, MCR 2.421 “does not abridge, enlarge, or in any wa y
modify existing rights and procedures under federal law, includin g
bankruptcy proceedings under 11 USC 101 et seq.” MCR 2.421(F).
A party “who is a named debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding” mus t
“file a notice of the bankruptcy proceeding in the state court action n o
later than 3 days after becoming subject to” the bankruptc y
proceeding and “serve the notice on all other parties in the state cour t
action as provided in MCR 2.107.” MCR 2.421(B)(1)-(2). “If a party t o
a state court action learns that another party in such action is a named
debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and notice of the bankruptc y
proceeding in [MCR 2.421(B)] has not previously been filed an d
served by the debtor,” that party may “file a notice of the bankruptc y
Page 4-38 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 253 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.9
proceeding in the state court action” and “serve the notice on all othe r
parties in the state court action as provided in MCR 2.107.” MCR
2.421(C)(1)-(2). The notice of bankruptcy proceeding must include
“the name(s) of the debtor(s),” “the court name and case number(s) o f
the bankruptcy proceeding(s),” and “if available, the name, telephon e
number, physical address, and email address for the debtor’s attorne y
in the bankruptcy proceeding(s).” MCR 2.421(D)(1)-(3).
After a notice of bankruptcy proceeding is filed, “the court may hold
in abeyance any further proceedings and may schedule a statu s
conference to consider the administrative closure of all or a portion o f
the state court action.” MCR 2.421(E). If “all or a portion of the stat e
court action is administratively closed under [MCR 2.421(E)] or
otherwise, it may be reopened if, on the motion of a party or on th e
court’s own initiative, the court determines that the automatic sta y
has been lifted, removed, or otherwise no longer impairs adjudicatio n
of all or a portion of the state court action.” Id.
B. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act
The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) governs the granting o f
stays to members of the military who are unable to appear at civi l
court proceedings. 50 USC 3931–50 USC 3938a; 50 USC Appx 501-596.
“[T]he SCRA is always to be liberally construed[.]” Johnson v Johnson,
329 Mich App 110, 119 (2019) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Where a servicemember is the defendant in a civil action o r
proceeding and does not make an appearance, a stay may be granted.
Upon its own motion or application of counsel, the court must grant a
stay for a minimum period of 90 days if it determines that:
“(1) there may be a defense to the action and a defens e
cannot be presented without the presence of th e
defendant; or
(2) after due diligence, counsel has been unable t o
contact the defendant or otherwise determine if a
meritorious defense exists.” 50 USC 3931(d); 50 USC
Appx 521(d).
Where a servicemember has notice of the civil proceedings, a sta y
may be granted upon the court’s own motion and must be granted
upon application by the servicemember if the application includes:
“(A) A letter or other communication setting forth fact s
stating the manner in which current military dut y
requirements materially affect the servicemember’ s
ability to appear and stating a date when th e
servicemember will be available to appear.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-39
=== Page 254 ===
Section 4.10 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(B) A letter or other communication from th e
servicemember’s commanding officer stating that th e
servicemember’s current military duty prevent s
appearance and that military leave is not authorized fo r
the servicemember at the time of the letter.” 50 USC
3932(b)(1)-(2); 50 USC Appx 522(b)(1)-(2).
“[A]lthough [50 USC 3932(b)(2)(B)] expressly state[s] that [the letter
or communication] must be ‘from’ the servicemember’s commandin g
officer . . . , nothing in the statutory language precludes the
servicemember’s commanding officer from making those statement s
in a letter authored by the servicemember [that is] adopted by th e
servicemember’s commanding officer.” Johnson, 329 Mich App at 123-
124 (the trial court properly denied a servicemember’s request for a
stay where the servicemember “offered no explanation for why o r
how her duties materially affected her ability to appear fo r
the . . . proceedings,” and “failed to state ‘a date when th e
servicemember [would] be available to appear’”).
“A service member who is granted a stay of a civil action o r
proceeding under subsection (b) may apply for an additional sta y
based on continuing material affect of military duty on th e
servicemember’s ability to appear.” 50 USC 3932(d)(1); 50 USC App x
522(d). However, “[u]nlike the stay under [50 USC 3932(b)], a n
additional stay under [50 USC 3932(d)] is not mandatory[.]” Johnson,
329 Mich App at 121 n 6. “If the court refuses to grant an additional
stay of proceedings . . ., the court shall appoint counsel to represen t
the servicemember in the action or proceeding.” 50 USC 3932(d)(2); 50
USC Appx 522(d)(2).
4.10 Dismissal
A. Generally
Dismissal of the case may occur in the following circumstances:
• Failure to serve the defendant before the expiration of
the summons, MCR 2.102(E)(1) and MCR 2.504(E);
• Lack of progress based on failure to take action for more
than 91 days “unless the parties show that progress i s
being made or that the lack of progress is no t
attributable to the party seeking affirmative relief,” MCR
2.502(A)(1);
• Notice of dismissal filed before the adverse party serves
an answer or a motion for summary disposition, or b y
stipulation of the parties, MCR 2.504(A)(1);
Page 4-40 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 255 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.10
• Failure to comply with the court rules or a court order,
MCR 2.504(B)(1); the plaintiff has shown no right t o
relief at the close of his or her proofs in a bench trial ,
MCR 2.504(B)(2); or
• Failure to timely file a motion for substitution “within 91
days after filing and service of a statement of the fact o f
the death [of a party],” “unless the party seeking
substitution shows that there would be no prejudice t o
any other party from allowing later substitution.” MCR
2.202(A)(1)(b).
• Action filed against wrong party (a deceased person)
who cannot be sued as a matter of law. Core Value s
Constr, LLC v Sheehan's on the Green, Inc, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2025), citing Lashbrook v Grasak, ___ Mich Ap p
___ (2025) (“A party wishing to bring a cause of actio n
against someone who is deceased must sue the decease d
person’s estate, not the deceased person.”) (quotatio n
marks omitted). In Core Values, ___ Mich App at ___, the
Court held that plaintiff’s “attempt to seek foreclosure of
the construction lien against the parents [ran] afoul o f
the settled principle that deceased people generall y
cannot be sued in their individual capacity.”Dismissal
for Failure to Serve
If a defendant is not served before the expiration of the summons, th e
action is deemed dismissed without prejudice as to that defendant,
unless the defendant has submitted to the court’s jurisdiction. MCR
2.102(E)(1) and MCR 2.504(E). See also Hyslop v Wojjusik, 252 Mic h
App 500, 510 (2002).
The court may set aside the dismissal on the stipulation of the partie s
or a motion as provided by MCR 2.102(F). The motion must be filed
within 28 days after notice of the order of dismissal was given, or i f
notice was not given, promptly upon learning of the dismissal. MCR
2.102(F)(3). In addition, the moving party must establish that servic e
of process was in fact made or the defendant submitted to the court’ s
jurisdiction, MCR 2.102(F)(1), and that “proof of service of proces s
was filed or the failure to file [was] excused for good cause shown. ”
34
MCR 2.102(F)(2).
B. Dismissal for Lack of Progress
On a party’s motion or sua sponte, a case may be dismissed for lack o f
progress if it appears that no steps have been taken or no proceeding s
have occurred within 91 days “unless the parties show that progres s
34 See Section 3.3 on summons and Section 3.4 on service of process.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-41
=== Page 256 ===
Section 4.10 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
is being made or that the lack of progress is not attributable to th e
party seeking affirmative relief.” MCR 2.502(A)(1). However, a notice
of proposed dismissal may not be sent if:
• a scheduling order has been entered under MCR
2.401(B)(2), and the time for completing the scheduled
events has not expired, or
• the case is set for a conference, an alternative dispute
resolution process, a hearing, or trial. MCR
2.502(A)(2)(a)-(b).
If no showing of progress is made, the court may direct the clerk t o
dismiss the action for lack of progress. MCR 2.502(B)(1). Th e
dismissal is without prejudice, unless the court orders otherwise. Id.
An action dismissed for lack of progress may be reinstated on motio n
for good cause. MCR 2.502(C). In determining whether good caus e
exists, a court may find one or more of the following factors relevant:
• whether the dismissal was technically or procedurally
inappropriate;
• whether the movant was diligent during the pendency
of the original action;
• whether the failure to make progress was justified;
• whether the movant was diligent in attempting to settle
or promptly reinstate the case; and
• whether there is possible prejudice to the nonmovant if
the action were to be reinstated. Wickings v Arctic
Enterprises, Inc, 244 Mich App 125, 142 (2000).
Note: This list is not exhaustive, and it does no t
preclude the analysis of any other relevant factor s
that may exist in a particular case. Wickings, 244
Mich App at 142 n 28.
“On reinstating an action, the court shall enter orders to facilitate th e
prompt and just disposition of the action.” MCR 2.502(C).
C. Voluntary Dismissal
1. Without Court Order
In most cases, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a cour t
order and upon payment of costs by (1) filing a notice of
dismissal before an opposing party serves an answer or a motio n
Page 4-42 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 257 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.10
under MCR 2.116, or (2) filing a stipulation signed by every
party. MCR 2.504(A)(1). Additional provisions exist in MCR
2.420 (settlements and judgments for minors and legall y
incapacitated individuals) and MCR 3.501(B) (class actions). Th e
dismissal is without prejudice unless otherwise stated in the
notice or stipulation. MCR 2.504(A)(1). Also, “a dismissal unde r
[MCR 2.504(A)(1)(a)] operates as an adjudication on the merits
when filed by a plaintiff who has previously dismissed an actio n
in any court based on or including the same claim.” MCR
2.504(A)(1). A dismissal with prejudice is res judicata because i t
35
is considered an adjudication on the merits. See Washington v
Sinai Hosp of Greater Detroit, 478 Mich 412, 417 (2007).
2. With Court Order
A court order is required if the plaintiff seeks to dismiss the
action after service of a responsive pleading or motion. MCR
2.504(A)(2). If the defendant files a counterclaim before bein g
served with a motion to dismiss, the court may not dismiss the
action unless the counterclaim can remain pending for
independent adjudication. MCR 2.504(A)(2)(a). A dismissal
under MCR 2.504(A)(2) is without prejudice unless the order
specifies otherwise. MCR 2.504(A)(2)(b).
“A motion for voluntary dismissal should not be granted whe n
the defendant would be legally prejudiced by the decision.”
Newman v Real Time Resolutions, Inc, 342 Mich App 405, 415
(2022). “An order of dismissal without prejudice should place the
defendants in no worse of a position than they were in before the
case began.” Id. at 415. If a plaintiff moves for voluntar y
dismissal but does not have “a valid claim they could bring after
dismissal,” dismissal with prejudice is warranted. Id. at 415
(noting that “[i]f the trial would have dismissed this matter
without prejudice, defendants would be legally prejudiced by
potentially having to defend another lawsuit filed by plaintiff
over this same issue, even though he legally cannot succeed”).
D. Involuntary Dismissal as a Sanction
When a party fails to comply with the court rules or a court order,
MCR 2.504(B)(1) authorizes the court, on its own initiative or on th e
opposing party’s motion, to enter a default judgment against th e
noncomplying party or to dismiss the noncomplying party’s claim o r
action.
35 See Section 2.17 on res judicata.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-43
=== Page 258 ===
Section 4.10 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Reasons for dismissing a case as a sanction include:
• Failure to permit discovery. MCR 2.313(B)(2)(c).
• Failure to appear at a scheduled conference or for
lacking adequate information or authority to effectivel y
participate in the conference. MCR 2.401(G).
• Failure to make progress on the case. MCR 2.502(A)(1).
• Failure to pay previously assessed fees, including
attorney fees. MCR 2.504(D); Sirrey v Danou, 212 Mic h
App 159, 160-161 (1995).
Dismissal is a drastic sanction. Vicencio v Jaime Ramirez, MD, PC, 21 1
Mich App 501, 506 (1995). “Severe sanctions such as default or
dismissal are predicated on a flagrant or wonton refusal to facilitat e
discovery that typically involves repeated violations of a court order. ”
Swain v Morse, 332 Mich App 510, 518 (2020). In deciding whether t o
dismiss the case, the court must “evaluate all available options on th e
record and conclude that the sanction of dismissal is just and proper. ”
Vicencio, 211 Mich App at 506. In Dean v Tucker, 182 Mich App 27, 32-
33 (1990), the Court referred to a nonexhaustive list of factors t o
consider when determining whether dismissal is an appropriat e
sanction:
“(1) whether the violation was wilful or accidental;
(2) the party’s history of refusing to comply wit h
discovery requests (or refusal to disclose witnesses);
(3) the prejudice to the defendant;
(4) actual notice to the defendant of the witness and the
length of time prior to trial that the defendant received
such actual notice;
(5) whether there exists a history of plaintiff’s engagin g
in deliberate delay;
(6) the degree of compliance by the plaintiff with other
provisions of the court’s order;
(7) an attempt by the plaintiff to timely cure the defect;
and
(8) whether a lesser sanction would better serve th e
interests of justice.”
A trial court has the authority to impose appropriate sanctions,
including dismissal, in order to “contain and prevent abuses so as t o
ensure the orderly operation of justice.” Maldonado v Ford Motor Co,
Page 4-44 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 259 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.10
476 Mich 372, 375 (2006). In Maldonado, the plaintiff and her counsel
ignored a trial court’s order suppressing “unduly prejudicial ”
evidence concerning the defendant’s expunged criminal record and
“engaged in a concerted and wide-ranging campaign . . . to publicize
the details of the inadmissible evidence through the mass media and
other available means.” Id. at 392. The trial court ultimately
sanctioned the misconduct by dismissing the plaintiff’s lawsuit afte r
having expressly warned the plaintiff and her counsel that violatio n
of the court’s order would result in dismissal. Id. at 394-395. “The trial
court has a gate-keeping obligation, when such misconduct occurs, t o
impose sanctions that will not only deter the misconduct but als o
serve as a deterrent to other litigants.” Id. at 392.
The “trial court abused its discretion by dismissing [plaintiff’s ]
complaint against [defendant] as a discovery violation” upon the tria l
court’s finding “that plaintiff ‘lied under oath’ at her deposition. ”
Swain, 332 Mich App at 517, 518. “Maldonado concerned seriou s
misconduct that went to the ability of the court to assure a fair trial. ”
Id. at 523. “In contrast, untruthful deposition testimony does no t
threaten the integrity of the judicial system. A witness can be
impeached at trial, and the jury can consider whether a witness wa s
lying in making its credibility determination.” Id. at 523-524. “[R]athe r
than protecting the judicial process, permitting judges to dismis s
cases for false deposition testimony would be a fundamental chang e
and could itself undermine the integrity of the judicial system that ha s
always relied on the fact-finder for credibility determinations.” Id. a t
524, 527 (“the fact that there is some ambiguity and equivocation in
plaintiff’s answers counsels against dismissal, and it als o
demonstrates why courts should be hesitant to impose sanction s
based upon a finding that the deponent intentionally made fals e
statements”).
A trial court’s “findings that plaintiffs deliberately delayed progres s
when progress was solely under their control strongly supported
dismissal with prejudice.” Tolas Oil & Gas Exploration Co v Bach Servs
& Mfg LLC, 347 Mich App 280, 318 (2023). A trial court’s “finding tha t
the delay was part of a pattern of gamesmanship also supported
dismissal with prejudice.” Id. at 318. In Tolas, the Court of Appeal s
concluded that “the trial court’s findings and determinations wer e
sufficient to allow the trial court to dismiss the case under its inheren t
authority to punish misconduct.” Id. at 318 (holding “[o]n this record,
we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when i t
dismissed the case with prejudice”).
An involuntary dismissal due to the plaintiff’s failure to comply wit h
the court rules or any court order will operate as an adjudication o n
the merits unless:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-45
=== Page 260 ===
Section 4.10 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(1) the order of dismissal provides otherwise,
(2) the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, or
(3) the case was dismissed for failure to join a part y
under MCR 2.205. MCR 2.504(B)(3).
See also Washington v Sinai Hosp of Greater Detroit, 478 Mich 412, 41 4
(2007) (holding that “[u]nder the plain language of MCR 2.504(B)(3),
the dismissal of the . . . untimely complaint [pursuant to MCR
2.116(C)(7)] was an adjudication on the merits”); Dawoud v State Farm
Mut Auto Ins Co, 317 Mich App 517, 523-524 (2016) (holding that MCR
2.504(B)(3) governed the effect of a dismissal under MCR
2.313(B)(2)(c) for failure to provide or permit discovery; because th e
court did not provide otherwise in the dismissal order, dismissal o f
the claims constituted an adjudication on the merits).
E. Failure to Timely File a Motion for Substitution
“Unless a motion for substitution is made within 91 days after filin g
and service of a statement of the fact of the death, the action must b e
dismissed as to the deceased party, unless the party seeking
substitution shows that there would be no prejudice to any other
party from allowing later substitution.” MCR 2.202(A)(1)(b).
MCR 2.202(A)(1)(b) “requires dismissal unless there is a showing o f
no prejudice.” Bradley v Progressive Marathon Ins Co, 345 Mich App
126, 134 (2022). However, “MCR 2.202(A)(1)(b) does not require tha t
the trial court refuse to dismiss the case if the plaintiff has showed n o
prejudice.” Bradley, 345 Mich App at 137. “Instead, when the plaintif f
has showed no prejudice, the trial court retains the discretion to eithe r
dismiss or retain the case.” Id. at 137.
“The plain language of MCR 2.202(A)(1) gives a trial court discretio n
to order the substitution of a party if that ‘party dies.’” Lashbrook v
Grasak, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). “Given the rule’s use of the
present-tense verb, . . . MCR 2.202(A)(1) only applies when a party t o
litigation ‘dies’ during the course of the litigation.” Lashbrook, ___
Mich App at ___ (holding that MCR 2.202(A) did not apply because
“the named defendants . . . were already deceased when plaintiff filed
his complaint”). “This is not to suggest that, when a plaintiff files sui t
against a deceased defendant, a trial court is forbidden fro m
substituting the deceased defendant for the deceased-defendant’ s
estate under [MCR 2.202(A)] or another rule.” Lashbrook, ___ Mic h
App at ___ n 2. “Rather, this conclusion merely recognizes that [th e
Michigan] court rules are not intended to address when a party sues a
deceased defendant.” Id. (“[A] deceased person cannot be sued as a
matter of law.”) (quotation marks and citations omitted).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.10
F. Involuntary Dismissal in a Bench Trial
At the close of the plaintiff’s evidence during an action, claim, o r
hearing without a jury, the court, on its own initiative, may dismis s
the case, or the defendant may move for dismissal on the ground tha t
the plaintiff has no right to relief based on the facts and la w
presented. MCR 2.504(B)(2). “The court may then determine the fact s
and render judgment against the plaintiff, or may decline to rende r
judgment until the close of all the evidence.” MCR 2.504(B)(2). Se e
also In re ASF, 311 Mich App 420, 427 (2015) (“[u]nder [MCR
2.504(B)(2)], ‘a motion for involuntary dismissal calls upon the trial
judge to exercise his function as trier of fact, weigh the evidence, pas s
upon the credibility of witnesses and select between conflictin g
inferences’”), quoting Marderosian v Stroh Brewery Co, 123 Mich Ap p
719, 724 (1983).
The standard on this motion is different than that for a directe d
verdict. In determining whether to dismiss an action under MCR
2.504(B)(2), the trial court is not “required to view the evidence in the
light most favorable to [the defendant], to resolve all conflicts o f
evidence in his favor, or to determine whether there [is] a genuin e
issue of material fact.” Williamstown Twp v Hudson, 311 Mich App 276,
289 (2015).
If the court grants a motion for involuntary dismissal, it must mak e
the required findings under MCR 2.517. MCR 2.504(B)(2).
G. Costs
Where the plaintiff commences an action involving the same clai m
against the same defendant in a previously dismissed action, th e
court has the discretion to order the plaintiff to pay costs from tha t
prior action and to “stay proceedings until the plaintiff has complied
with the order.” MCR 2.504(D).
H. Standard of Review
Questions of law pertinent to an involuntary dismissal motion based
on MCR 2.504(B)(2) are reviewed de novo. Samuel D Begola Servs, Inc v
Wild Bros, 210 Mich App 636, 639 (1995). The trial court’s factual
findings are reviewed for clear error. Williamstown Twp v Hudson, 31 1
Mich App 276, 289 (2015). “A trial court’s findings are considere d
clearly erroneous where [the reviewing court is] left with a definit e
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.” Id. (quotation s
and citation omitted).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-47
=== Page 262 ===
Section 4.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
The decision whether to grant the plaintiff’s motion for voluntar y
dismissal is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. McKelvie v Mount
Clemens, 193 Mich App 81, 86 (1992).
When dismissal is used as a sanction, it is reviewed for an abuse o f
discretion. Donkers v Kovach, 277 Mich App 366, 368 (2007).
A trial court’s decision whether to reinstate an action is reviewed fo r
an abuse of discretion. Wickings v Arctic Enterprises, Inc, 244 Mich Ap p
125, 138 (2000).
Committee Tip:
There are specific provisions in the court rules
addressing reinstatement of a case when the
dismissal is for failure to serve a party or for lack
of progress. If the dismissal is without prejudice,
at a minimum, the case can be refiled. If the
dismissal is with prejudice, relief may be possible
under MCR 2.603(D) (Default and Default
Judgment) or MCR 2.612 (Relief From Judgment
or Order).36
4.11 Default and Default Judgments
There is a distinction between entry of default and entry of defaul t
judgment: “the former operates as an admission by the defaulting part y
of issues of liability, but leaves the issues of damages unresolved until
entry of judgment. The latter reduces the default to a judgment fo r
money damages.” Dollar Rent-A-Car Sys v Nodel Constr, 172 Mich Ap p
738, 743 (1988) (citations omitted). “A defaulted party retains the right t o
challenge the amount of damages, but the defaulted party may no longe r
challenge liability.” Lakeside Retreats, LLC v Camp No Counselors, LLL, 340
Mich App 79, 89 (2022).
A. Default
1. Purpose of Default
“The purpose of the default procedure is to keep the docket s
current, to expedite the disposal of causes so as to prevent a
dilatory or procrastinating defendant from impeding the
36See Section 4.11 on default and default judgments and Section 4.12 on setting aside judgments.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.11
plaintiff in the establishment of his claim.” Mason v Marsa, 14 1
Mich App 38, 41 (1985).
A party may be found in default for either failing to plead or
answer, or for improper conduct such as discovery abuses (i n
37
which case, default is used as a sanction). Kalamazoo Oil Co v
Boerman, 242 Mich App 75, 87 (2000).
2. Entry of Default
MCR 2.603(A)(1) governs entry of default:
“If a party against whom a judgment for
affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or
otherwise defend as provided by these rules, the
clerk must enter the default of that party if that fac t
is:
(a) known to the clerk of the court, or
(b) verified in the manner prescribed by MCR
1.109(D)(3) and filed with the court in a
request for the default.”
“[A] party must not be defaulted [under MCR 2.603(A)(1)] if the
party pleads or, as an alternative to filing a responsive pleading,
otherwise defends the action.” Huntington Nat’l Bank v Ristich,
292 Mich App 376, 388 (2011) (defendant failed to “otherwise
defend” himself by filing a motion for an evidentiary hearing
and stay of the proceedings and was therefore properly
defaulted). See also Marposs Corp v Autocam Corp, 183 Mich Ap p
166, 168-170 (1990) (defendant “otherwise defend[ed]” itself
under MCR 2.603(A)(1) by filing an application for leave t o
appeal trial court’s denial of its motion for change of venue and
was therefore improperly defaulted). Note that both Huntingto n
Nat’l Bank and Marposs were decided before verification under
MCR 1.109(D)(3) was required. See ADM File No 2002-37,
effective May 1, 2019.
Notice of entry of the default must be sent to the defaulted party
and all parties who have appeared. MCR 2.603(A)(2). If th e
defaulted party has not appeared, notice of entry of the defaul t
must still be given either by personal service, ordinary first-clas s
mail at his or her last known address or place of service, or as the
court directs. MCR 2.603(A)(2). The party seeking a default mus t
send the notice and file proof of service and a copy of the notice
with the court. MCR 2.603(A)(2)(b).
37See Section 4.10(D) for a discussion of entering a default as a sanction.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-49

Section 4.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
3. Effect of Entry of Default
Entry of a default does impact:
• The defaulted party’s right to challenge liability.
Lakeside Retreats LLC v Camp No Counselors LLC, 340
Mich App 79, 89 (2022). The defaulted party’s right t o
assert affirmative defenses. Haller v Walczak, 347 Mic h
292, 299 (1956). Presumably, this means comparative
negligence would not apply to the damage s
proceedings. However, the trial court has discretio n
whether to allow evidence of comparative negligence
for purposes of a damages hearing in “only those
instances where default is utilized as a sanction for
discovery abuses.” Kalamazoo Oil Co v Boerman, 24 2
Mich App 75, 87-88 (2000).
• The right to participate in the adjudication of the
property division after a default is entered in a n
equitable action, such as a divorce. Draggoo v Draggoo,
223 Mich App 415, 427 (1997).
Entry of a default does not impact:
• The defaulted party’s right to challenge the amount of
damages. Lakeside Retreats, 340 Mich App at 89 (2022).
“[T]herefore, a party is . . . entitled to notice i n
advance of a default judgment for purposes of
challenging the amount of damages.” Id. at ___.Th e
defaulted party’s right to a jury trial on the issue of
damages. Zaiter v Riverfront Complex, Ltd, 463 Mic h
544, 554 (2001). If the defaulted party preserved the
right to a jury trial and if further proceedings are
necessary to determine damages, the defaulted party
has the right to a jury trial on the issue of damages. Id.
at 554. However, with the defaulted party’s consent,
the moving party may ask the court to decide the
damages issue.38 Marshall Lasser, PC v George, 25 2
Mich App 104, 106 (2002).
• A party’s right to contest its vicarious liability (where
that party’s sole source of liability is vicarious) once a
default has been entered against a coparty. Rogers v J
B Hunt Transp, Inc, 466 Mich 645, 655 (2002).
38See Section 7.19 for a discussion of waiver of jury trial.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.11
B. Default Judgments
1. Notice of Request for Judgment
The defaulted party must be given notice of a request for defaul t
judgment if:
39
• the defaulted party has appeared in the action;
• the judgment seeks relief different in kind or in a
greater amount than the pleadings state; or
• the pleadings do not demand a specific amount of
damages. MCR 2.603(B)(1)(a)(i)-(iii).
“The purpose of the notice requirement is to apprise the
default[ed] party of the possibility of entry of judgment so tha t
he may have an opportunity to participate in any hearing
necessary to ascertain the amount of damages or other form of
remedy to be granted.” Dollar-Rent-A-Car Sys v Nodel Constr, 17 2
Mich App 738, 743 (1988). See Section 4.11(B)(2) for mor e
information about the hearing on damages.
“The notice . . . must be served at least 7 days before entry of th e
requested default judgment.” MCR 2.603(B)(1)(b). This seven-
day notice period also applies “to any hearing or trial
necessitated by the request for judgment when that hearing
occurs on a date preceding the actual entry of the defaul t
judgment.” Dollar-Rent-A-Car Sys, 172 Mich App at 743-744.
Notice must be pursuant o MCR 2.107 if the defaulted party ha s
appeared. MCR 2.603(B)(1)(c). If the defaulted party has no t
appeared, notice may be by personal service, ordinary first-clas s
mail at the defaulted party’s last known address or the place of
service, or as the court directs. Id.
A pleading’s caption must identify the document. MCR
1.109(D)(1)(b)(iv). Where the pleading’s caption does not identify
“that the pleading contain[s] or [is] intended to be notice of
plaintiff’s intent to request entry of a default judgment,” the
document “cannot be considered as notice that is consistent wit h
40
either the letter or the spirit of [MCR 1.109(D)(1)(b)(iv)].”
Brooks Williamson and Assoc, Inc v Mayflower Constr Co, 308 Mic h
App 18, 28 (2014) (rejecting the claim that timely notice wa s
39A general appearance entered by the defaulted party’s agent is sufficient to trigger the notice
requirement under MCR 2.603(B)(1)(a)(i). Brooks Williamson and Assoc, Inc v Mayflower Constr Co, 308
Mich App 18, 27-28 (2014) (notice was required where the defaulted party’s agent entered a genera l
appearance in the action by answering the plaintiff’s request for discovery).
40Formerly MCR 2.113(C)(1)(d). See ADM File No. 2002-37, effective September 1, 2018.

Section 4.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
provided in the text of a case evaluation summary filed by the
plaintiff with the mediation tribunal and noting that the Court’ s
“construction of [MCR 1.109(D)(1)(b)(iv)] prevents a party from
concealing notice in the text of a document that might not be
given close or immediate attention prior to the entry of a defaul t
judgment and preserves the fair opportunity for a defendant t o
contest damages where the defendant might otherwise no t
dispute liability”).
2. Hearings on Damages
“[A] default is merely an admission of liability and not a n
admission regarding the proper amount of damages.” Epps v 4
Quarters Restoration LLC, 498 Mich 518, 554 (2015). Thus, “[i]f th e
amount of damages is in dispute, a defaulting defendant i s
nonetheless entitled to a hearing, at which [the defendant] may
challenge the plaintiff’s alleged damages amount, if the trial
court determines that a hearing is necessary.” Id. at 555. Th e
defaulted party has a right to participate in the proceedings o n
damages. American Central Corp v Stevens Van Lines, Inc, 103 Mic h
App 507, 513 (1981).
3. Entry of Default Judgment
By clerk. The clerk may enter the default judgment for the
amount requested if the amount that the plaintiff is seeking is
made by written request, verified under MCR 1.109(D)(3), and if:
• the plaintiff’s claim is for a sum certain or amoun t
that can be certain by computation;
• the defendant was defaulted for failure to appear;
• the defendant is not an infant or incompeten t
person; and
• the amount of damages is less than or equal to th e
amount stated in the complaint. MCR 2.603(B)(2).
By court. The court may enter default judgments in all other
cases. MCR 2.603(B)(3). The party seeking the default judgmen t
must file a motion requesting the court to enter a defaul t
judgment. Id. However, the court cannot enter a defaul t
judgment “against a minor or incompetent person unless the
person is represented by a conservator, guardian ad litem, or
other representative.” MCR 2.603(B)(3)(a).
In certain instances, it may be necessary to conduct more
proceedings before the judgment may be entered. See MCR

Effect. “Entry of a default judgment is equivalent to a n
admission of every well-pleaded matter in the complaint.” Epps
v 4 Quarters Restoration LLC, 498 Mich 518, 554 (2015).
Notice. Once a default judgment is entered, the party wh o
sought the default must promptly serve the default judgment o n
all parties. MCR 2.603(B)(4). “Proof of service must be filed wit h
the court.” Id.
4. Entry of Default Judgment as a Sanction
When a party fails to obey an order to provide or permi t
discovery, MCR 2.313(B)(2)(c) authorizes a trial court to enter a
default judgment against the disobedient party. However, the
court “should carefully consider the circumstances of the case t o
determine whether a drastic sanction such as the entry of a
default judgment is appropriate.” In re Hall Trust, 346 Mich Ap p
75, 92 (2023) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “The record
should reflect that the trial court gave careful consideration to all
of the factors involved and considered all of its options i n
determining the sanction that was just and proper in the contex t
of the case before it. Ultimately, the court’s chosen discovery
sanction must be proportionate and just.” Id. at 92 (cleaned up).
“Before imposing the sanction of a default judgment, a trial cour t
should consider whether the failure to respond to discovery
requests extends over a substantial period of time, whether a n
existing discovery order was violated, the amount of time tha t
has elapsed between the violation and the motion for a defaul t
judgment, the prejudice to parties seeking the sanction, and
whether willfulness has been shown.” In re Hall Trust, 346 Mic h
App at 92, 93 (cleaned up; holding that “[e]ach of those
considerations supports the default-judgment sanctio n
imposed” “based upon the persistent, willful, egregiou s
discovery violations committed”).
4.12 Setting Aside Judgments
A. Generally
Relief from an entry of default or a default judgment may be granted
under either MCR 2.603(D) or MCR 2.612(C). See Alken-Ziegler, Inc v
Waterbury Headers Corp, 461 Mich 219, 234 n 7 (1999).

B. Setting Aside Default or Default Judgment Under Michigan
Court Rule 2.603(D)
Unless MCR 2.612 provides otherwise, a motion to set aside default or
default judgment brought pursuant to MCR 2.603 must be filed befor e
the default judgment is entered or within 21 days of entry of th e
default judgment if the defaulted party was personally served. MCR
41
2.603(D)(2)(a)-(b).
Except when grounded on lack of jurisdiction (or under certai n
42
circumstances involving multiple defendants ), a default or defaul t
judgment may be set aside only when two conditions are fulfilled:
(1) Good cause for failure to make a timely response ha s
been shown.
(2) A statement of facts showing a meritorious defense,
verified in the manner prescribed by MCR 1.109(D)(3),
is filed. MCR 2.603(D)(1).
Generally, the court “[should] not set aside a default that has bee n
properly entered.” Village of Edmore v Crystal Automation Sys, Inc, 32 2
Mich App 244, 255 (2017).
The “good cause” and “meritorious defense” elements of a motion t o
set aside a default must be considered separately; it is improper t o
blur the two elements. Alken-Ziegler, Inc v Waterbury Headers Corp, 46 1
43
Mich 219, 229-234 (1999).
1. Good Cause
Good cause sufficient to set aside a default “can be shown by: (1)
a substantial procedural defect or irregularity or (2) a reasonable
excuse for the failure to comply with the requirements tha t
created the default.” Tindle v Legend Health, PLLC, 346 Mich Ap p
468, 476 (2023) (quotation marks and citation omitted). While
“the good cause and meritorious defense elements of MCR
2.603(D)(1) . . . are separate requirements,” and “if a party state s
41MCR 2.603(D)(2) is silent regarding the timing of a motion to set aside a default or default judgment if
the defaulted party was not personally served.
42“[W]here a bill makes a joint charge against several defendants, and one of them makes default, . . . if the
suit should be decided against the complainant on the merits, the bill will be dismissed as to all th e
defendants alike—the defaulter as well as the others.” Epps v 4 Quarters Restoration LLC, 498 Mich 518 ,
555-556 (2015) (noting that the default against a defaulting party “would need to be set aside” as to a
claim if that claim failed on the merits against the non-defaulting defendant) (quotation marks an d
citations omitted).
43“However, “if a party states a meritorious defense that would be absolute if proven, a lesser showing of
‘good cause’ will be required than if the defense were weaker, in order to prevent a manifest injustice. ”
Alken-Ziegler, Inc, 461 Mich at 233-234. See Section 4.12(B)(2) for a discussion of meritorious defense.

a meritorious defense that would be absolute if proven, a lesser
showing of ‘good cause’ will be required than if the defense
were weaker, in order to prevent a manifest injustice.” Shawl v
Spence Bros, Inc, 280 Mich App 213, 233-235 (2008) (cleaned up).
Trial courts must consider the totality of the circumstances whe n
determining whether a party has shown good cause in suppor t
of a motion to aside a default judgment, including the followin g
factors:
“(1) whether the party completely failed t o
respond or simply missed the deadline to file;
(2) if the party simply missed the deadline to file,
how long after the deadline the filing occurred;
(3) the duration between entry of the defaul t
judgment and the filing of the motion to set aside
the judgment;
(4) whether there was defective process or notice;
(5) the circumstances behind the failure to file or
file timely;
(6) whether the failure was knowing or intentional;
(7) the size of the judgment and the amount of
costs due under MCR 2.603(D)(4);
(8) whether the default judgment results in a n
ongoing liability (as with paternity or child
support); and
(9) if an insurer is involved, whether internal
policies of the company were followed.” Shawl, 28 0
Mich App at 237-238.
This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Shawl, 280 Mich App at
239. Trial courts should only consider factors that are relevant t o
the case and should exercise its discretion in deciding how muc h
weight each factor should receive. Id.
The following cases discuss whether good cause to set aside a
default or default judgment exists:
• Tindle, 346 Mich App at 480, 481: Because a
medical assistant generally lacks “authority t o
make decisions on behalf of an office of an entity,”
the “plaintiff did not properly serve defendants ”
despite mailing “a copy of the summons and
complaint to [defendant’s] principal office a s

required by [MCR 2.105].” Tindle 346 Mich App a t
476, fn 2 (noting that “the failure to serve process i s
itself sufficient to warrant setting aside a defaul t
judgment”).
• Village of Edmore v Crystal Automation Sys, Inc,
322 Mich App 244, 257 (2017): Failing to file a
timely answer where the party “otherwise
defended” the action under MCR 2.603(A)(1) by
“vigorously opposing plaintiff’s motions for
injunctive relief and partial summary disposition.”
• Brooks Williamson and Assoc, Inc v Mayflower
Constr Co, 308 Mich App 18, 26 (2014): “[S]ervice
[of process] on [a court-appointed receiver is]
44
sufficient under [MCR 2.105(I) ], and [a
defendant] cannot establish good cause to set aside
[a] default judgment on [the] ground” that “[the]
defendant [was] also entitled to be personall y
served[.]”
• Bradley v Fulgham, 200 Mich App 156, 158-159
(1993): Failing to notify the defaulted party of entry
of the default.
2. Verified Statement of Facts Showing Meritorious
Defense
MCR 2.603(D)(1) requires defendants to execute a verified
statement showing a meritorious defense “in the manner
prescribed by MCR 1.109(D)(3)[.]” The purpose of a verifie d
statement showing a meritorious defense “is to inform the trial
court whether the defaulted defendant has a meritorious defens e
to the action.” Tindle v Legend Health, PLLC, 346 Mich App 468,
481 (2023) (citation omitted). Accordingly, the statement of fact s
must be verified by someone with “personal knowledge of the
facts, state admissible facts with particularity, and show that th e
[person] can testify competently to the facts” contained in th e
verified statement. Id. at 481 (citation omitted). The defaulted
party must file a verified statement of facts showing a
meritorious defense before a default may be set aside, even if
good cause exists. See Shawl v Spence Bros, Inc, 280 Mich App 213,
45
232 (2008); MCR 2.603(D)(1).
44Formerly MCR 2.105(H). See ADM File No. 2020-20, effective May 1, 2021.
45Shawl was decided prior to the issuance of ADM File No. 2002-37, effective May 1, 2019, which amende d
MCR 2.603 to require the filing of a verified statement rather than an affidavit to establish a meritorious
defense.
Page 4-56 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 271 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.12
A statement filed in support of a motion to set aside a default or
default judgment may be verified by:
“(a) oath or affirmation of the party or of someone
having knowledge of the facts stated; or
(b) except as to an affidavit, including the
following signed and dated declaration: ‘I declare
under the penalties of perjury that this _____ ha s
been examined by me and that its contents are true
to the best of my information, knowledge, and
belief.’” MCR 1.109(D)(3).
Trial courts must consider the totality of the circumstances whe n
determining whether a party has presented a meritoriou s
defense for the purposes of MCR 2.603(D). Shawl, 280 Mich Ap p
at 236-237. Trial courts should consider whether the verified
statement contains evidence that:
“(1) the plaintiff cannot prove or defendant ca n
disprove an element of the claim or a statutory
requirement;
(2) a ground for summary disposition exists under
MCR 2.116(C)(2), (3), (5), (6), (7), or (8); or
(3) the plaintiff’s claim rests on evidence that i s
inadmissible.” Shawl, 280 Mich App at 238.
This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Shawl, 280 Mich App at
239. Trial courts should only consider factors that are relevant t o
the case and should exercise its discretion in deciding how muc h
weight each factor should receive. Id.
“[W]hen it is shown that [a] party did not receive notice of [an]
opponent’s intent to request a default judgment [as required
46
under MCR 2.603(B)(1) ], the requirement in MCR 2.603(D)(1)
that a party must show a meritorious defense to set aside a
default judgment results in a denial of the constitutional right t o
due process[, and] . . . that portion of the court rule i s
unenforceable as applied to a party who has not been provided
adequate notice.” Brooks Williamson and Assoc, Inc v Mayflower
Constr Co, 308 Mich App 18, 36 (2014).

• Tindle, 346 Mich App at 484: Affidavit to support a

a meritorious defense.

49
arm jurisdiction could not be acquired.
• Lindsley v Burke, 189 Mich App 700, 702-703 (1991) :

relief in avoidance of governmental immunity.
3. Costs
“An order setting aside [a] default or default judgment must be
conditioned on the defaulted party paying the taxable cost s
incurred by the other party in reliance on the default or defaul t
judgment, except as prescribed in MCR 2.625(D).” MCR

C. Setting Aside Final Judgment Under Michigan Court Rule
2.612
While a default or default judgment may be set aside pursuant t o
MCR 2.603(D), relief may also be sought under MCR 2.612. See MCR
2.603(D)(3).
1. Defendant Not Personally Notified
MCR 2.612(B) states:
“A defendant over whom personal jurisdiction wa s
necessary and acquired, but who did not in fac t
have knowledge of the pendency of the action,
may enter an appearance within 1 year after final
judgment, and if the defendant shows reaso n
justifying relief from the judgment and innocen t
third persons will not be prejudiced, the court may
relieve the defendant from the judgment, order, or
proceedings for which personal jurisdiction wa s
necessary, on payment of costs or on conditions the
court deems just.”
A default judgment constitutes a final judgment. Lawrence M
Clarke, Inc v Richco Const, Inc, 489 Mich 265, 280 (2011).
51
Personal jurisdiction. For purposes of MCR 2.612(B), personal
jurisdiction over a party is required to satisfy due process.
Lawrence M Clarke, Inc, 489 Mich at 272, 275. In Clarke, the Cour t
assumed that personal jurisdiction was actually acquired
(despite the defendants’ arguments to the contrary) because i t
ultimately “conclude[d] that defendants [lacked actual
knowledge of the pending suit and thus were] entitled to relief
under MCR 2.612(B)[.]” Lawrence M Clark, Inc, 389 Mich at 275-
276.
Knowledge of the action. Based on the plain language of MCR
2.612(B), a defendant may seek relief from a default judgmen t
under this rule “as long as the defendant did not have actual
knowledge of the pending action.” Lawrence M Clarke, Inc, 48 9
51See Section 2.12 and the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Personal Jurisdiction Flowcharts regarding

Unincorporated Voluntary Associations.

Section 4.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Mich at 276. In Clarke, the defendants did not have actua l
knowledge of the pending action where (1) they were never
personally served with a summons and complaint, (2) they
52
stated in their affidavit of meritorious defense that they onl y
became aware of the action after personal property had bee n
seized from their homes (nearly two years after the plaintiff filed
a complaint), (3) the plaintiff’s attorney “impliedly conceded
that defendants did not have actual notice . . . when he argued
that constructive notice is sufficient to bar relief under MCR
2.612(B),” and (4) the plaintiff attempted to serve the defendant s
by repeatedly mailing notice to an address known to not be a
current address and publishing notice in a newspaper located i n
a county where the defendants did not reside and had no t
worked for over three years. Lawrence M Clarke, Inc, 489 Mich a t
277-278.
Reasons justifying relief. A defendant may show that he or sh e
has a “‘reason justifying relief from the judgment’” as required
by MCR 2.612(B) “by showing that he or she (1) did not hav e
actual notice of the action and (2) has a meritorious defense.”
Lawrence M Clarke, Inc, 489 Mich at 282. A defendant does no t
need to show “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable
neglect, newly discovered evidence, fraud, misrepresentation, or
other misconduct of an adverse party because MCR 2.612(C)
provides for relief from a judgment on those grounds.” Lawrence
M Clarke, Inc, 489 Mich at 281.
Prejudice to third parties. MCR 2.612(B) requires the court t o
determine that no innocent third parties will be prejudiced if
relief is granted. See Lawrence M Clarke, Inc, 489 Mich at 285.
2. Other Grounds for Relief
“The procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be
by motion as prescribed in [the Michigan Court Rules] or by a n
independent action.” MCR 2.612(C)(4).
Pursuant to MCR 2.612(C)(1), a court may relieve a party or th e
party’s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or
proceeding on the following grounds:
“(a) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.
52 The Court noted that consideration of an affidavit of meritorious defense–even if it is not filed at the
same time as the motion for relief from judgment–may be considered when deciding whether relief ma y
be granted under MCR 2.612(B). Lawrence M. Clarke, Inc, 489 Mich at 277 n 6.

=== Page 275 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.12
(b) Newly discovered evidence which by due
diligence could not have been discovered in time
to move for a new trial under MCR 2.611(B).
(c) Fraud (intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation,
or other misconduct of an adverse party.
(d) The judgment is void.
(e) The judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged; a prior judgment on which it is based
has been reversed or otherwise vacated; or it is n o
longer equitable that the judgment should have
prospective application.
(f) Any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment.”
Motions made pursuant to MCR 2.612(C)(1)(a)-(c) must be mad e
“within one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding wa s
entered or taken.” MCR 2.612(C)(2). Motions made pursuant t o
MCR 2.612(C)(1)(d)-(f) must be made within a reasonable time.
MCR 2.612(C)(2).
Relief under MCR 2.612 may be appropriate even if a case i s
closed. See Peterson v Oakwood Healthcare, Inc, 336 Mich App 333,
347 (2021). In Peterson, “[t]he trial court’s reliance on the fact tha t
the case was closed [to deny relief was] highly dubious.
Following that premise to its logical end, no party could ever
obtain relief from judgment under MCR 2.612(C) once a case wa s
closed,” and that “premise is patently wrong.” Peterson, 336
Mich App at 347-348 (concluding, however, that the trial court’ s
rejection of plaintiff’s argument that it could obtain relief from
the final order based on a subsequently issued decision of the
Court of Appeals was correct). “MCR 2.612 does not mentio n
any such extra requirements and instead simply states that a
party can seek relief ‘[o]n motion and on just terms,’ MCR
2.612(C)(1), and that [a] motion [under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(d)-(f)]
must be made within a reasonable time, MCR 2.612(C)(2). ”
Peterson, 336 Mich App at 347 (alteration in original).
“Additionally, . . . the vehicle to ‘reopen’ a case is MCR 2.612(C)
itself.” Peterson, 336 Mich App at 347.
“If a circuit court order grants relief to a party as described
under [MCL 600.309a(2)], an opposing party may file an appea l
of right from that order to the court of appeals. Action in the
circuit court must be stayed while the matter is on appeal.” MCL
53
600.309a(3). In addition, the court must “take appropriate step s
toward ensuring, consistent with the appellate court rules, a
timely processing of the appeal.” MCL 600.309a(4). MCL

Section 4.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
600.309a “applies only if a party seeks relief from a circuit cour t
judgment entered in a civil action based on a jury verdict on any
of the following grounds:
(a) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.
(b) Newly discovered evidence.
(c) Fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduc t
of an adverse party.
(d) That the judgment is void.
(e) Another reason that justifies relief from the
operation of the judgment.” MCL 600.309a(2).
MCL 600.309a “does not apply to an action to which [MCL
600.6098] applies,” and “applies only to an action, case, o r
proceeding commenced after” September 10, 2021. MCL
600.309a(5)-(6).
a. Rule 2.612(C)(1)(a)
A party may request relief from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding on the basis of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect. MCR 2.612(C)(1)(a).
However, the “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect” language should not be used “t o
bypass the analysis under MCR 2.603(D)(1)[.]” Tindle v
Legend Health, PLLC, 346 Mich App 468, 486, 487 (2023).
“MCR 2.603(D)(1) establishes a rigorous analysis for th e
manner in which a default judgment could be set aside.
Setting aside a judgment for merely being surprised
about a hearing the next day, especially without arguing
there was any issue with the notice of entry of defaul t
judgment, does not capture the essence of MCR
2.603(D)(1).” Tindle, 346 Mich App at 487. “Labelin g
improper service as such would swallow the analysi s
under 2.603(D)(1)[.]” Tindle, 346 Mich App at 48 8
(observing that defendants did “not present any
extraordinary circumstance that would justify labeling
the effect of the improper service as a ‘surprise’”).

b. Rule 2.612(C)(1)(b)
“Under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(b), newly discovered evidence is
not sufficient to grant relief from a judgment unless i t
could not have been discovered through due diligence i n
time to move for a new trial under MCR 2.611(B).” Int' l
Outdoor, Inc v SS Mitx, LLC, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023).
“A party seeking relief from judgment based on newly
discovered evidence must establish that (1) the evidence,
not simply its materiality, is newly discovered, (2) the
evidence is not merely cumulative, (3) the newly
discovered evidence is likely to change the result, and (4)
the party moving for relief from judgment was not able t o
produce the evidence with reasonable diligence.” Id. a t
___.
c. Rule 2.612(C)(1)(c)
A party may request relief from a final judgment, order,
or proceeding on the basis of fraud, misrepresentation, or
other misconduct by the adverse party. MCR
2.612(C)(1)(c). “MCR 2.612(C)(1)(c) does not impose a due
diligence requirement on the party seeking relief fro m
judgment on the basis of fraud, misrepresentation, or the
misconduct of an adverse party.” Int’l Outdoor, ___ Mic h
App at ___.
“An evidentiary hearing is necessary where fraud [on the
court] has been alleged because the proof required t o
sustain a motion to set aside a judgment because of fraud
is of the highest order.” Kiefer v Kiefer, 212 Mich App 176,
179 (1995) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “[I]t i s

motion without first conducting an evidentiary hearing
regarding the allegations.” Id.

e. Rule 2.612(C)(1)(e)
There is a distinction between a trial court’s judgmen t
being reversed or vacated and being overruled by
subsequent caselaw. Kidder v Ptacin, 284 Mich App 166,
170 (2009). “Reversing or vacating a decision changes the
result in the specific case before an appellate court. On the
other hand, a decision to overrule a particular rule of law
affects not only the specific case before the appellate
court, but also future litigation. . . . However, an appellate
court’s pronouncement that a rule of law no longer
applies does not change the result of an effective
judgment.” Id. In a previous appeal in Kidder, the Court of
Appeals, based on a case that was later reversed, ordered
that summary disposition be granted in favor of the
54
defendants. Id. at 169. When the case on which th e
Court based its decision was reversed, the Kidder plaintiff
did not appeal the trial court’s decision to order summary
disposition; instead she moved under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(e)
to reinstate her case at the trial court. Kidder, 284 Mic h
App at 169. Because “MCR 2.612 envisions a cour t
relieving a party from its own judgment, not the
judgment of a higher authority” and the original Kidder
decision to grant summary disposition to the defendant s
constituted the law of the case, the trial court erred i n
granting the plaintiff’s motion under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(e).
Kidder, 284 Mich App at 170.
f. Rule 2.612(C)(1)(f)
“Generally, relief is granted under MCR 2.116(C)(1)(f)
when the reason for setting aside the judgment is no t
included in [MCR 2.612(C)(1)(a)-MCR 2.612(C)(1)(e)], an d
when the judgment was obtained by the improper
conduct of the party in whose favor the judgment wa s
entered.” Int’l Outdoor, ___ Mich App at ___. Relief under
MCR 2.612(C)(1)(f) “require[s] the presence of bot h
extraordinary circumstances and a demonstration tha t
setting aside the judgment will not detrimentally affec t
the substantial rights of the opposing party.” Rose v Rose,
289 Mich App 45, 62 (2010) (noting that “extraordinary
circumstances warranting relief from a judgment [under
MCR 2.612(C)(1)(f)] generally arise when the judgmen t
was obtained by the improper conduct of a party.”) I n
addition, “the competing concerns of finality and fairnes s

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.12
counsel a cautious, balanced approach” to setting aside a
judgment under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(f). Rose, 289 Mich App
at 58.
Subsequently Issued Appellate Decision. “[R]elief from
judgment under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(f) is inappropriat e
where a party has not sought appellate review of a trial
court’s final order and the basis for relief from judgmen t
is a subsequent appellate decision in a different case.”
Peterson v Oakwood Healthcare, Inc, 336 Mich App 333, 34 8
(2021) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (“the trial
court’s rejection of the [plaintiff’s] position that it could
obtain relief from the final order based on a subsequently
issued decision of [the Court of Appeals was] correct”).
Judgment of Divorce. In Rose, the parties entered into a
consent judgment of divorce whereby the defendan t
would pay the plaintiff spousal support if the plaintiff
would forego any interest in a jointly-owned company.
Rose, 289 Mich App at 47. The divorce judgment expressly
stated that “it is the intention of the parties that regardles s
of any change in circumstances . . . ,this spousal suppor t
provision is to be non-modifiable.” Id. at 48. Two years
after the consent judgment was executed, the company
shut down, and the defendant sought relief from the
divorce judgment under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(f). Rose, 28 9
Mich App at 48-49. The Court concluded that relief could
not be granted because extraordinary circumstances did
not exist and because setting aside the spousal suppor t
provision would “detrimentally affect plaintiff’ s
substantial rights.” Id. at 60-61. The Court stated:
“[T]he events giving rise to [the company’s ]
failure qualify as tragic, but hardl y
extraordinary. As a seasoned business owner,
defendant undoubtedly understood that a n
economic downturn, or financia l
mismanagement could endanger the solvenc y
of his company. He nevertheless agreed tha t
plaintiff could receive nonmodifiable spousa l
support. We feel hard-pressed to conclud e
that a business failure amounts to a
circumstance so unexpected and unusual tha t
it may constitute a ground for setting aside a
final, binding and nonmodifiable spousa l
support provision.” Rose, 289 Mich App at 62.
Caselaw Retroactively Reversed. Once a case is closed, a
party cannot be granted relief under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(f)
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 4-65
=== Page 280 ===
Section 4.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
based upon a retroactive change or clarification in the
law. King v McPherson Hosp, 290 Mich App 299, 304 (2010).
In King, it was undisputed that the case was closed, and
55
that the case on which the court relied was later
reversed and given partial retroactive effect. Id. at 307-
308. The Court of Appeals concluded that the plaintiff
could not be granted relief under MCR 2.612(C)(1)(f)
56
because binding precedent prohibited such relief an d
denying the requested relief did not constitute a n
extraordinary circumstance as required by MCR
2.612(C)(1)(f). King, 290 Mich App at 308.
Error in Jurisdiction. “An order entered without subject-
matter jurisdiction may be challenged collaterally and
directly. Error in the exercise of jurisdiction may be
challenged only on direct appeal. The erroneous exercise
of jurisdiction does not void a court’s jurisdiction as doe s
the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. However, error i n
the exercise of jurisdiction can result in the setting aside
of the judgment.” Grubb Creek Action Comm v Shiawassee
Co Drain Comm’r, 218 Mich App 665, 669 (1996) (internal
citations omitted).
Attorney’s Negligence. An attorney’s negligence i s
generally attributable to his or her client and is no t
normally grounds to set aside a default judgment. Pascoe
v Sova, 209 Mich App 297, 298-299 (1995). However,
where the attorney withdraws from the case and does no t
provide notice to the client, and the client is defaulted
because neither the client nor the withdrawn attorney
appeared in court, grounds may exist to set aside the
default judgment. Id. at 300-301.
3. Independent Action
“[MCR 2.612(C)] does not limit the power of a court to entertain
an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order,
or proceeding; to grant relief to a defendant not actually
personally notified as provided in subrule (B); or to set aside a
judgment for fraud on the court.” MCR 2.612(C)(3). However,
“[r]elief may not be sought or obtained by the writs of cora m
nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, bills of review, or bills in the
nature of a bill of review.” MCR 2.612(C)(4).
55 Mullins v St Joseph Mercy Hosp, 480 Mich 948 (2007).
56 See Reynoldsville Casket Co v Hyde, 514 US 749 (1995); People v Maxson, 482 Mich 385 (2008); Sumner v
Gen Motors Corp (On Remand), 245 Mich App 653 (2001); and Gillespie v Bd of Tenant Affairs of the Detroit
Housing Comm, 145 Mich App 424 (1985).
Page 4-66 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 281 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 4.12
“The express language of MCR 2.612(C)(3) states that th e
provisions in MCR 2.612(C)(1) and [MCR 2.612](2) in no way
‘limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action t o
relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding . . . . ’
Hence, a party need not allege fraud or nonservice in order t o
seek relief from a judgment in an independent action pursuan t
to MCR 2.612(C)(3).” Trost v Buckstop Lure Co, Inc, 249 Mich Ap p
580, 584-585 (2002).
If the claim is based on an independent action, the one year
period of limitations stated in MCR 2.612(C)(2) does not apply .
Kiefer v Kiefer, 212 Mich App 176, 182 (1995).
D. Standard of Review
1. Decisions Under MCR 2.603
The ruling on a motion to set aside a default or default judgmen t
is reviewed for a clear abuse of discretion. Saffian v Simmons, 47 7
Mich 8, 12 (2007).
2. Decisions Under MCR 2.612
The ruling on a motion for relief from judgment pursuant t o
MCR 2.612(B) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Bullington v
Corbell, 293 Mich App 549, 554-555 (2011). A motion brough t
pursuant to MCR 2.612(C) is also reviewed for an abuse o f
discretion. Mikedis v Perfection Heat Treating Co, 180 Mich Ap p
189, 203 (1989). In exercising its discretion, the trial court should
balance the public’s interest in the finality of judgments agains t
the individual’s interest in correcting an injustice. Id.
“Where a party has alleged that a fraud has been committed o n
the court [pursuant to MCR 2.612(C)(1)(c)], it is generally a n
abuse of discretion for the court to decide the motion withou t
first conducting an evidentiary hearing regarding the
allegations.” Kiefer v Kiefer, 212 Mich App 176, 179 (1995).

Section 5.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
5.1 Discovery in General
A. Availability, Scope, and Time for Completion
“The court may control the scope, order, and amount of discovery,
consistent with [the Michigan Court Rules].” MCR 2.301(C).
Availability. “In a case where initial disclosures are required, a
party may seek discovery only after the party serves its initial
disclosures under MCR 2.302(A) Otherwise, a party may see k
discovery after commencement of the action when authorized by
[the Michigan Court Rules], by stipulation, or by court order.” MCR
2.301(A)(1). See Section 5.2 for more information on initial
disclosures. Notwithstanding, discovery is not permitted in a
1
district court action prior to entry of a judgment unless the partie s
stipulate or the court grants leave. MCR 2.301(A)(2). “A motion fo r
discovery may not be filed unless the discovery sought ha s
previously been requested and refused.” Id. Discovery is no t
permitted in small claims or civil infraction matters. MCR
2.301(A)(3).
Scope. Michigan follows the open, broad discovery policy,
permitting liberal discovery. Reed Dairy Farm v Consumers Power Co,
227 Mich App 614, 616 (1998). However, “Michigan’s commitmen t
to open and far-reaching discovery does not encompass fishing
expeditions.” Augustine v Allstate Ins Co, 292 Mich App 408, 419-420
(2011) (quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted). “MCR
2.302(B)(1) clearly obligates the trial court to balance the burden o f
the proposed discovery against the value of the proposed
discovery.” Micheli v Mich Auto Ins Placement Facility, 340 Mich Ap p
360, 374 (2022). “Parties may obtain discovery regarding any non-
[2]
privileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claims or defense s
and proportional to the needs of the case, taking into account all
pertinent factors, including whether the burden or expense of the
proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, the complexity of
the case, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the
amount in controversy, and the parties’ resources and access t o
relevant information. Information within the scope of discovery
need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.” MCR
2.302(B)(1). The Michigan Court Rules do not impose a requiremen t
of good cause for the discovery of relevant, nonprivileged
documents or things. See Ostoin v Waterford Twp Police Dep’t, 189
Mich App 334, 340 (1991). “However, a trial court should als o
protect the interests of the party opposing discovery so as not t o
1See Section 8.1()regarding post judgment discovery proceedings.
2See Section 5.10 regarding privileged materials.
Page 5-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 285 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.1
subject that party to excessive, abusive, or irrelevant discovery
requests.” Cabrera v Ekema, 265 Mich App 402, 407 (2005).
Where a producing party shows that ESI is not reasonably
accessible because of undue burden or cost, the party does not have
to produce the information. MCR 2.302(B)(6). However, if the
requesting party files a motion to compel, or the producing party
files a motion for a protective order, the court may order the
producing party to provide the information despite a showing of
undue burden or cost “if the requesting party shows good cause,
considering proportionality under [MCR 2.302(B)(1)] and the
limitations of [MCR 2.302(C)].” MCR 2.302(B)(6). “The court ma y
specify conditions for the discovery, including allocation of the
expense, and may limit the frequency or extent of discovery of ESI
(whether or not the ESI is from a source that is reasonably
accessible).” Id.
Completion. For actions pending before a circuit or probate court,
the time to complete discovery is set by an order entered pursuan t
to MCR 2.401(B). MCR 2.301(B)(1). For actions where discovery i s
granted by leave or stipulation, the order or stipulation must set a
time for completion of discovery. MCR 2.301(B)(2). “A time set by
stipulation may not delay the scheduling of the action for trial.” Id.
“As may be reasonable under the circumstances, or by leave of the
court, motions with regard to discovery may be brought after the
date for completion of discovery.” MCR 2.301(B)(4). See Section 5.11
for information on discovery motions.
B. Constitutionality of Discovery Orders
“To the extent that a discovery order entered by a trial court in a
civil lawsuit constitutes a search by a government agent within the
meaning of the Fourth Amendment, the search would be reasonable
if entered by a neutral judge in accord with ‘closely circumscribed’
rules that provide safeguards equivalent to probable cause.” Martin
v Martin, 331 Mich App 224, 245 (2020). In Michigan, “the cour t
rules provide adequate protections to ensure that properly made
discovery orders are reasonably consistent with the Fourt h
Amendment” because: (1) “the discovery must be relevant to th e
subject matter and must not be privileged” under MCR 2.302(B)(1);
(2) the party or person from whom discovery is sought may seek a
protective order under MCR 2.302(C); (3) trial courts have th e
authority “to provide significant protections against unreasonable
discovery requests” under MCR 2.302(C); (4) “improper discover y
requests may be subject to sanction” under MCR 2.302(G); and (5)
“a party aggrieved by a trial court’s decision to order discovery may
appeal” under MCR 7.203(B)(1). Martin, 331 Mich App at 246-247
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-3
=== Page 286 ===
Section 5.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(2020) (finding that a discovery order granting the defendant’ s
motion to compel the plaintiff’s cell phone for a forensic review wa s
reasonable because “[u]nder the totality of the circumstances, the
protections afforded to [the plaintiff] exceeded those applicabl e
when police officers make a warrant request,” and “the court [had]
already formulated a protection plan in case any privileged
communications [found] their way into the forensic report”).
C. Supplementing Disclosures and Responses
“A party that has made a disclosure under MCR 2.302(A)–or tha t
has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or
request for admission–must supplement or correct its disclosure or
response:
(i) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some
material respect the disclosure or response i s
incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional o r
corrective information has not otherwise been mad e
known to the other parties during the discovery proces s
or in writing or
(ii) as ordered by the court.” MCR 2.302(E)(1)(a).
“A duty to supplement disclosures or responses may be imposed by
order of the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time before
trial through requests for supplementation.” MCR 2.302(E)(1)(b).
Failure to provide properly supplemented disclosures or responses,
even without an order compelling discovery, may result i n
imposition of the sanctions stated in MCR 2.313(B), and i n
particular, MCR 2.313(B)(2)(b) (authorizing the court to refuse t o
allow the insubordinate party to support or oppose designated
claims or defenses, or to prohibit that party from introducing
specific matters into evidence). MCR 2.302(E)(2). “[D]eposition
testimony is not subject to the duty to supplement discovery
responses under MCR 2.302(E)” because “a deposition is not a
response to a request for discovery.” Swain v Morse, 332 Mich Ap p
510, 520 (2020). See Section 5.2(D) for information on failure t o
provide disclosures.
D. Alternative Forms of Discovery
The court has discretion to order discovery by methods other tha n
those specifically mentioned in the court rules, subject to the scope
restrictions in MCR 2.302(B). MCR 2.302(B)(4)(a)(iii). See also Reed
Dairy Farm v Consumers Power Co, 227 Mich App 614, 616-618 (1998)
(upholding a trial court’s decision to allow the plaintiff to submi t
interrogatories to nonparty expert witnesses in lieu of expending
Page 5-4 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 287 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.1
time and money traveling across the country questioning eac h
witness individually).
The purpose of discovery is to simplify and clarify issues. Domako v
Rowe, 438 Mich 347, 360 (1991). “Restricting parties to formal
methods of discovery [does] not aid in the search for truth[.]” Id. In
Domako, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing th e
defendant to conduct ex parte interviews with the plaintiff’ s
witness. Id. at 357-361. The Michigan Supreme Court concluded tha t
allowing ex parte interviews advances the purpose of MCR 1.105,
which states, “[t]hese [court] rules are to be construed,
administered, and employed by the parties and the court to secur e
the just, speedy, and economical determination of every action[.]”
Domako, 438 Mich at 360-361. By allowing ex parte interviews, the
parties may save time and money, litigation may be simplified, and
settlements are encouraged. Id. at 361.
E. Discovery Planning Conference
“Upon court order or written request by another party, the partie s
must confer among themselves and prepare a proposed discovery
plan. The attorneys of record and all unrepresented parties tha t
have appeared are jointly responsible for arranging the conference
and for attempting in good faith to agree on a proposed discovery
plan.” MCR 2.401(C)(1). The proposed discovery plan must addres s
all disclosure and discovery matters, including those set forth i n
MCR 2.401(B), and identify proposed deadlines for the completion
3
of disclosures and discovery. MCR 2.401(C)(2). The plan i s
submitted to the court by stipulation or motion and should note any
disagreements between the parties. MCR 2.401(C)(3). The cour t
reviews the plan and enters a scheduling order. See MCR
2.401(B)(2); MCR 2.401(C)(2). Once the court has entered a
scheduling order, a party seeking to change a deadline must show
good cause. MCR 2.401(C)(2).
“The court may enter an order governing disclosure, discovery, and
any other case management matter the court deems appropriate.”
MCR 2.401(C)(3). The court may also enter an appropriate sanction,
including payment of attorney fees and costs, if a party or thei r
attorney fails to make a good faith effort to participate in developing
and submitting a proposed discovery plan. MCR 2.401(C)(4).
3The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(2) and
MCR 2.408(C)(2) to early scheduling conferences under MCR 2.401(B). See Section 1.15 for more
information on videoconferencing.

F. ESI Conference, Plan, and Order
5
Conference. “Where a case is reasonably likely to include the
discovery of ESI, parties may agree to an ESI Conference, the judge
may order the parties to hold an ESI Conference, or a party may file
a motion requesting an ESI Conference. At the ESI Conference, th e
parties must consider the matters set forth in MCR 2.401(J)(1).
“Attorneys who participate in an ESI Conference or who appear at a
conference addressing ESI issues must be sufficiently versed i n
matters relating to their clients’ technological systems t o
competently address ESI issues; counsel may bring a clien t
representative or outside expert to assist in such discussions.” MCR
2.401(J)(3).
ESI discovery plan. Within 14 days of an ESI Conference, th e
parties must file an ESI discovery plan and statement concerning
the issues upon which the parties cannot agree. MCR 2.401(J)(2).
The plaintiff’s attorney must submit the ESI discovery plan to the
court unless the parties agree otherwise. Id. “The ESI discovery pla n
may include:
(a) a statement of the issues in the case and a brie f
factual outline;
(b) a schedule of discovery including discovery of ESI;
(c) a defined scope of preservation of information an d
appropriate conditions for terminating the duty t o
preserve prior to the final resolution of the case;
(d) the forms in which ESI will be produced; and
(e) the sources of any ESI that are not reasonabl y
accessible because of undue burden or cost.” MCR
2.401(J)(2).
ESI order. “The court may enter an order governing the discover y
of ESI pursuant to the parties’ ESI discovery plan, upon motion of a
party, by stipulation of the parties, or on its own.” MCR 2.401(J)(4).
G. Final Pretrial Conference and Order
“The court may hold a final pretrial conference to facilitate
preparation of the action for trial and to formulate a trial plan.”
4See Section 5.11(A)(2) for information on the failure to preserve ESI.
5The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(1) and
MCR 2.408(C)(1) to civil pretrials. See Section 1.15 for more information on videoconferencing.

MCR 2.401(H)(2). A final pretrial conference can be combined wit h
a settlement conference. Id. Each unrepresented party and the lead
attorney who will conduct trial on behalf of a represented party
must attend the conference. Id. At the conference, the parties may
discuss the following items, which may be memorialized in a join t
final pretrial order either before or after the conference, as ordered
by the court:
“(a) scheduling motions in limine;
(b) a concise statement of plaintiff’s claims, includin g
legal theories;
(c) a concise statement of defendant’s defenses an d
claims, including crossclaims and claims of third-part y
plaintiffs, and defenses of cross defendants or third-
party defendants, including legal theories;
(d) a statement of any stipulated facts or other matters;
(e) issues of fact to be litigated;
(f) issues of law to be litigated;
(g) evidence problems likely to arise at trial;
(h) a list of witnesses to be called unless reasonabl e
notice is given that they will not be called, and a list o f
witnesses that may be called, listed by category a s
follows:
(i) live lay witnesses;
(ii) lay deposition transcripts or videos includin g
resolving objections and identifying portions to be
read or played;
(iii) live expert witnesses; and
(iv) expert deposition transcripts or video s
including resolving objections and identifying
portions to be read or played.
(i) a list of exhibits with stipulations or objections t o
admissibility;
(j) an itemized statement of damages and stipulations t o
those items not in dispute;
6The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(1) and
MCR 2.408(C)(1) to civil pretrials. See Section 1.15 for more information on videoconferencing.

Section 5.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(k) estimated length of trial;
(i) time for plaintiff’s proofs;
(ii) time for defendant’s proofs; and
(iii) whether it is a jury or nonjury trial.
(l) trial date and schedule;
(m) whether the parties will agree to arbitration;
(n) a statement that counsel have met, conferred an d
considered the possibility of settlement and alternativ e
dispute resolution, giving place, time and date and th e
current status of these negotiations as well as plans fo r
further negotiations;
(o) rules governing conduct of trial;
(p) jury instructions;
(q) trial briefs;
(r) voir dire; and
(s) any other appropriate matter.” MCR 2.401(H)(2).
“If the court finds at a final pretrial conference that due to a lack of
reasonable diligence by a party the action is not ready for trial, the
court may enter an appropriate order to facilitate preparation of the
action for trial and may require the offending party to pay th e
reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, caused by the lack of
diligence.” MCR 2.401(H)(1).
Committee Tip:
Final pretrial conferences should be set 3- 4
•
weeks before trial and should last approximately
15 minutes to one hour, depending on the case.
H. Mediation of Discovery Disputes
If a discovery dispute arises and unless precluded by MCR
3.216(C)(3), the dispute may be mediated upon stipulation of th e
parties or order of the court. MCR 2.411(H). If the parties agree, the
discovery mediator may be the same mediator as otherwise selected
Page 5-8 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 291 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.1
under MCR 2.411(B). MCR 2.411(H). All provisions of MCR 2.411
apply to a discovery mediator, except:
“(1) The order under [MCR 2.411(C)(1)] will specify the
scope of issues or motions referred to the discover y
mediator, or whether the mediator is appointed on a n
ongoing basis.
(2) The mediation sessions will be conducted a s
determined by the mediator, with or without parties, i n
any manner deemed reasonable and consistent wit h
these rules and any court order.
(3) The court may specify that discovery disputes mus t
first be submitted to the mediator before being filed as a
motion unless there is a need for expedited attention b y
the court. In such cases, the moving party shall certify i n
the motion that it is filed only after failure to resolve th e
dispute through mediation or due to a need fo r
immediate attention by the court.
(4) In cases involving complex issues of ES I
[(electronically stored information)], the court ma y
appoint an expert under MRE 706. By stipulation of the
parties, the court may also designate the expert as a
discovery mediator of ESI issues under this rule, i n
which case the parties should address in the orde r
appointing the mediator whether the restrictions o f
MCR 2.411(C)(3) and [MCR] 2.412(D) should b e
modified to expand the scope of permissibl e
communications with the court.” MCR 2.411(H).
See Section 6.6 for general information on mediation.
I. Award of Expenses
Unless it would be manifestly unjust:
• the court must order the party seeking discovery to pay th e
expert’s reasonable fee for time spent in a deposition if the
party is seeking to depose, or discover through alternative
means, an expert hired by the opposing party. This fee
cannot include preparation time. MCR 2.302(B)(4)(c)(i).
• the court may also require “the party seeking discovery t o

be called as a witness. If the expert is not expected to be
called to testify, the court must order the party seekin g

discovery to pay the other party a fair portion of the fee s
and expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining the
information. MCR 2.302(B)(4)(c)(ii).
“MCR 2.302(B)(4) applies to experts who are third parties to th e
litigation; such experts examine the facts from a distance, offer
opinions, and have no financial stake in the outcome other tha n
receiving a court-approved witness fee.” Spine Specialists of Mich, P C
v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 317 Mich App 497, 503 (2016).
Accordingly, “[a]s the sole owner of [the plaintiff medical facility]
and the physician who treated [a patient] on [plaintiff’s] behalf, [the
owner-physician] was obligated to provide deposition testimony”
in the plaintiff’s action to recover payment for services rendered t o
the patient following a motor vehicle accident, and was therefore
“ineligible [under MCR 2.302(B)(4)(c)(i)] to charge a fee for hi s
deposition”; “[w]hile a party (or an employee of a party, as here )
with specialized knowledge may offer an expert opinion within hi s
or her field, the court rules do not contemplate payment to a party
offering an opinion on its own behalf.” Spine Specialists, 317 Mic h
App at 502, 503, 504 (noting that the owner-physician would “serve
as [the plaintiff’s] spokesperson at trial, and [had] a vested interes t
in the outcome of [the] case”).
J. Determining an Appropriate Discovery Violation
Sanction
The court must choose a sanction that is “proportionate and just[.]”
Kalamazoo Oil Co v Boerman, 242 Mich App 75, 87 (2000). The severe
sanction of a default judgment may be imposed only when a party
has flagrantly and wantonly refused to provide or permit discovery.
Hardrick v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 294 Mich App 651, 661 (2011). I n
Hedrick, the trial court found that although the plaintiff had bee n
severely prejudiced by the defendant’s late and incomplete
discovery responses, entry of a default judgment was not warranted
because the defendant did not “impair discovery in a maliciou s
sense.” Id. at 659. Thus, the trial court imposed what it considered t o
be “an appropriate lesser sanction”: precluding the defendant from
presenting any witnesses or evidence, and limiting the defendant t o
challenging the plaintiff’s expert witness through cross-
examination. Id. at 657, 659. The Court of Appeals concluded tha t
“[e]ven though the [trial] court labeled its order as ‘a lesser
sanction,’ [it] actually imposed a sanction more severe and limiting
than a default judgment would have been. Had the court granted
[the plaintiff’s] request for a default judgment, [defendant] would
have been permitted to present evidence to prove the extent of
[plaintiff’s] damages.” Id. at 661. “Because the sanction wa s
disproportionate and affected the entirety of the trial,” the Court of
Appeals found the sanction inappropriate. Id. at 664.
Page 5-10 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 293 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.1
In Dean v Tucker, 182 Mich App 27, 32-33 (1990), the Court referred
to a nonexhaustive list of factors to consider when determining a n
appropriate sanction for a discovery violation:
“(1) whether the violation was wilful or accidental;
(2) the party’s history of refusing to comply wit h
discovery requests (or refusal to disclose witnesses);
(3) the prejudice to the [other party];
(4) actual notice to the [other party] of the witness an d
the length of time prior to trial that the [other party ]
received such actual notice;
(5) whether there exists a history of [the party] engagin g
in deliberate delay;
(6) the degree of compliance by the [party] with othe r
provisions of the court’s order;
(7) an attempt by the [party] to timely cure the defect[; ]
and
(8) whether a lesser sanction would better serve th e
interests of justice.”
Indeed, “trial courts were provided with broad authority to fashion
remedies for discovery violations, and those provisions include d
the power to stay a case pending compliance with the discovery
order.” Tolas Oil & Gas Exploration Co v Bach Servs & Mfg LLC, 347
Mich App 280, 304 (2023) (holding the “trial court had the authority
to sanction plaintiffs’ discovery violations by fashioning a n
appropriate remedy, which could include an order to compensate
[defendants] for their costs and reasonable attorney fees caused by
the misconduct involving the dispute over plaintiffs’ exper t
witnesses”). Thus, “the trial court could rely on its inheren t
authority to order a stay pending payment of the award if the
decision to stay the proceedings was consistent with fairness and
justice under the totality of the circumstances.” Id. at 306 (observing
that the “relevant question is whether the trial court abused it s
discretion”).
In Tolas, “plaintiffs did not make a good-faith effort to comply with
discovery requests involving the experts and compounded tha t
failure by giving inadequate and misleading responses after the trial
court granted [defendant’s] motion to compel. Plaintiffs continued
to engage in dilatory tactics during the months that it took to resolve
the dispute over a lesser sanction for the discovery violation.” Id. a t
311 (noting “the trial court had to hold three separate hearings to
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-11
=== Page 294 ===
Section 5.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
resolve the matter”). Accordingly, “it was appropriate for the tria l
court to fashion a remedy that mitigated the harm caused by
plaintiffs’ initial failure to disclose and their subsequent violation o f
the order compelling disclosure” and “reasonable for the trial cour t
to punish the misconduct and deter future misconduct by orderin g
plaintiffs to reimburse [defendants] for all the costs and reasonable
attorney fees that they incurred in the dispute[.]” Id. at 311-312. Th e
Tolas Court held that “[u]nder the totality of the circumstances, the
decision to award those fees that could be directly attributed t o
plaintiffs’ failures (1) to make adequate disclosures in discovery and
(2) to comply with the court’s order to compel fell within the range
of reasonable outcomes.” Id. at 312. The Court further held that,
“[u]nder the totality of these circumstances, it was entirely
reasonable for the trial court to limit plaintiffs’ ability to furthe r
engage in such tactics by staying the proceedings until plaintiff s
demonstrated their commitment to moving the case forward b y
paying the sanction.” Id. at 313. Therefore, “the trial court did no t
abuse its discretion when it ordered plaintiffs to pay the reasonable
attorney fees and costs . . . as an alternate sanction to striking the
experts” and “did not abuse its discretion when it stayed the
proceedings pending payment of the sanction.” Id. at 313.
K. Removal of Discovery Materials from File
1. Removal by Stipulation
“If the parties stipulate to the removal of . . . discovery
materials from the file, the clerk may remove the materials an d
dispose of them in the manner provided in the stipulation. ”
MCR 2.316(B)(1).
2. Removal by the Clerk
“The clerk may initiate removal of . . . discovery materials fro m
the file in the following circumstances.
(i) If an appeal has not been taken, 18 months afte r
entry of judgment on the merits or dismissal of the
action.
(ii) If an appeal has been taken, 91 days after th e
appellate proceedings are concluded, unless the
action is remanded for further proceedings in the
trial court.” MCR 2.316(B)(2)(a).
When possible, the clerk must notify the parties and counsel o f
record that materials will be removed from the file and
destroyed on a specified date at least 28 days after the notice i s
Page 5-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 295 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.2
served, unless the party who filed the materials retrieves the m
from the clerk’s office or a party files a written objection to th e
removal. MCR 2.316(B)(2)(b)(i)-(ii).
If an objection is filed, the clerk must schedule a hearing an d
provide notice to the parties. MCR 2.316(B)(2). MCR 2.119
applies to the hearing. See MCR 2.316(B)(2). The materials ma y
only be removed upon court order following notice and th e
opportunity of the opposing party to be heard. Id.
3. Removal by Order
“On motion of a party, or on its own initiative after notice and
hearing, the court may order . . . discovery materials removed
at any other time on a finding that the materials are no longe r
necessary. However, no . . . discovery materials may b e
destroyed by court personnel or the clerk until the periods se t
froth in [MCR 2.316(B)(2)(a)(i)] or [MCR 2.316(B)(2)(a)(ii)] hav e
passed.” MCR 2.316(B)(3).
L. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision to grant or deny discovery is reviewed for a n
abuse of discretion. Reed Dairy Farm v Consumers Power Co, 227 Mich
App 614, 616 (1998).
5.2 Disclosure
A. Required Initial Disclosures
“Except as exempted by [the Michigan Court Rules], stipulation, o r
court order, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request,
provide to the other parties:
(a) the factual basis of the party’s claims and defenses;
(b) the legal theories on which the party’s claims an d
defenses are based, including, if necessary for a
reasonable understanding of the claim or defense,
citations to relevant legal authorities;
(c) the name and, if known, the address and telephon e
number of each individual likely to have discoverabl e
information–along with the subjects of tha t
information–that the disclosing party may use t o

control and may use to support its claims or defenses,
unless the use would be solely for impeachment;
(e) a description by category and location of al l
documents, ESI, and tangible things that are not in th e
disclosing party’s possession, custody, or control tha t
the disclosing party may use to support its claims o r
defenses, unless the use would be solely fo r
impeachment. The description must include the nam e
and, if known, the address and telephone number of th e
person who has possession, custody, or control of th e
material;
(f) a computation of each category of damages claimed
by the disclosing party. who must also make availabl e
for inspection and copying as under MCR 2.310 the

computation is based, including materials bearing o n
the nature and extent of injuries suffered;
(g) a copy (or an opportunity to inspect a copy) o f
pertinent portions of any insurance, indemnity, securit y

reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment,
including self-insured retention and limitations o n
coverage, indemnity, or reimbursement for amount s
available to satisfy a judgment; and
(h) the anticipated subject areas of expert testimony. ”
MCR 2.302(A)(1).
Additional disclosures are required for no-fault cases, MCR
2.302(A)(2), and claims for personal injury damages, MCR
2.302(A)(3).
“A party must serve initial disclosures based on the informatio n
then reasonably available to the party. However, a party is no t
excused from making disclosures because the party has not fully
investigated the case or because the party challenges the sufficiency
of another party’s disclosures or because another party has no t
made its disclosures.” MCR 2.302(A)(6). “Disclosures under [MCR
2.302(A)] are subject to MCR 2.302(G), must be in writing, signed,
Page 5-14 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 297 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.2
and served, and a proof of service must be promptly filed.” MCR
2.302(A)(7).
B. Cases Exempt from Disclosure
“Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered, the following are exemp t
from initial disclosure under [MCR 2.302](A)(1)-(3):
(a) an appeal to the circuit court under subchapter 7.100;
(b) an action in district court (see MCR 2.301[A][2]);
(c) an action under subchapter 3.200 [(domesti c
relations)];
(d) an action brought without an attorney by a person i n

3.700; and
(j) an action for habeas corpus under MCR 3.303 and
[MCR] 3.304.” MCR 2.302(A)(4).
C. Time for Initial Disclosures
The time for filing initial disclosures may be modified by stipulatio n
or order. See MCR 2.302(A)(5)(a).
A party filing a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party
complaint must serve its initial disclosures within 14 days after any
opposing party files an answer to the pleading. MCR
2.302(A)(5)(b)(i). The answering party must serve its initial
disclosures within 14 days after the filing party’s disclosures are du e
or 28 days after the answering party files its answer, whichever i s
later. MCR 2.302(A)(5)(b)(ii). Service of disclosures is only required
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-15
=== Page 298 ===
Section 5.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
on parties that have appeared; however, later-appearing partie s
must be served disclosures within 14 days of their appearance. MCR
2.302(A)(5)(b)(iii).
“A party first served or otherwise joined after the time for initial
disclosures under [MCR 2.302(A)(5)(a)-(b)] must serve its initial
disclosures within 14 days after filing the party’s first pleading ,
unless a stipulation or order sets a different time.” MCR
2.302(A)(5)(c).
D. Failure to Disclose
A party seeking disclosure may file a motion to compel if a party
fails to serve a disclosure as required by MCR 2.302(A). MCR
2.313(A)(2)(a). See Section 5.11 for information on motions t o
compel. “If a party fails to provide information or identify a witnes s
as required by MCR 2.302(A) or [MCR 2.302](E), the party is no t
allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a
motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially
justified or is harmless.” MCR 2.313(C)(1). See Section 5.12 for
additional information about disclosure of witnesses.
E. Removal of Disclosure Materials from File
1. Removal by Stipulation
“If the parties stipulate to the removal of disclosure . . .
materials from the file, the clerk may remove the materials an d
dispose of them in the manner provided in the stipulation. ”
MCR 2.316(B)(1).
2. Removal by the Clerk
“The clerk may initiate removal of disclosure . . . material s
from the file in the following circumstances.
(i) If an appeal has not been taken, 18 months afte r
entry of judgment on the merits or dismissal of the
action.
(ii) If an appeal has been taken, 91 days after th e
appellate proceedings are concluded, unless the
action is remanded for further proceedings in the
trial court.” MCR 2.316(B)(2)(a).
When possible, the clerk must notify the parties and counsel o f
record that materials will be removed from the file and
destroyed on a specified date at least 28 days after the notice i s

=== Page 299 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.3
served, unless the party who filed the materials retrieves the m
from the clerk’s office or a party files a written objection to th e
removal. MCR 2.316(B)(2)(b)(i)-(ii).
If an objection is filed, the clerk must schedule a hearing an d
provide notice to the parties. MCR 2.316(B)(2). MCR 2.119
applies to the hearing. See MCR 2.316(B)(2). The materials ma y
only be removed upon court order following notice and th e
opportunity of the opposing party to be heard. Id.
3. Removal by Order
“On motion of a party, or on its own initiative after notice and
hearing, the court may order disclosure . . . materials removed
at any other time on a finding that the materials are no longe r
necessary. However, no disclosure or discovery materials ma y
be destroyed by court personnel or the clerk until the period s
set froth in [MCR 2.316(B)(2)(a)(i)] or [MCR 2.316(B)(2)(a)(ii)]
have passed.” MCR 2.316(B)(3).
5.3 Depositions
A. Deposition of Party On Oral Examination
7
A party may take the oral deposition of another party. MCR
2.306(A)(1). Leave of court must be obtained when the plaintiff
wishes to depose the defendant before he or she has had a
reasonable time to obtain an attorney, or if the deponent is one of the
8
individuals listed in MCR 2.306(A)(2). MCR 2.306(A)(1). “A
reasonable time is deemed to have elapsed if:
(a) the defendant has filed an answer;
(b) the defendant’s attorney has filed an appearance;
(c) the defendant has served notice of the taking of a
deposition or has taken other action seeking discovery;
(d) the defendant has filed a motion under MCR 2.116;
or
(e) 28 days have expired after service of the summon s
and complaint on a defendant or after service mad e
under MCR 2.106.” MCR 2.306(A)(1).
7The oral deposition is subject to the scope of discovery discussed in Section 5.1(A).
8Persons in prison or patients in a state home, institution, or hospital for the mentally ill or mentall y
handicapped, or any other state home, institution, or hospital.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-17
=== Page 300 ===
Section 5.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
The party seeking to depose another party must provide reasonable
written notice to every party in the action. MCR 2.306(B)(1). Th e
notice must include the time of the deposition, location, and the
name and address of each deponent. MCR 2.306(B)(1)(a)-(b). If th e
name of a deponent is unknown, “a general description sufficient t o
identify the person or the particular class or group to which the
person belongs” will be allowed. MCR 2.306(B)(1)(b). The part y
seeking the deposition may name certain entities as the deponent, i n
which case the notice must be served at least 14 days before the
scheduled deposition. See MCR 2.306(B)(3).
“The deposition of each [party or] produced witness may no t
exceed one day of seven hours.” MCR 2.306(A)(3); MCR 2.306(B)(3).
A party may also request that the party-deponent produc e
documents or tangible things. MCR 2.306(B)(2). “MCR 2.310 applie s
to the request.” MCR 2.306(B)(2).
Where the witness to be deposed is a high-ranking governmen t
official or a corporate officer, the trial court must employ the “apex
deposition rule.” Alberto v Toyota Motor Corp, 289 Mich App 328, 33 6
(2010). “[T]he apex deposition rule provides that before a plaintiff
may take the deposition of a high-ranking or ‘apex’ governmental
official or corporate officer, the plaintiff must demonstrate both tha t
the government official or corporate officer possesses superior or
unique information relevant to the issues being litigated and tha t
the information cannot be obtained by a less intrusive method, suc h
as by deposing lower-ranking employees.” Id. at 333. The Cour t
emphasized that the apex rule does not shift the burden of proof t o
the party seeking discovery. Id. at 338. Rather, “after the party
opposing the deposition demonstrates by affidavit or other
testimony that the proposed deponent lacks personal knowledge or
unique or superior information relevant to the claims in issue, the n
the party seeking the deposition of the high-ranking corporate
officer or public official must demonstrate that the relevan t
information cannot be obtained absent the disputed deposition.” Id.
at 339 (two high-ranking corporate officers were not required t o
attend a deposition regarding the plaintiff’s claim that a defect in a
Toyota vehicle caused the accident that resulted in the death of the
plaintiff’s decedent where the two corporate officers had generalized
knowledge of the vehicle’s defect, yet “had no unique or superior
knowledge of, or role in designing, the vehicle at issue or i n
implementing manufacturing or testing processes”).
During the deposition, the court that is hearing the action, or the
court in the county or district where the deposition is taking place,
may terminate or limit the scope and manner of the deposition if the
deponent or a party files a motion and shows “that the examinatio n
Page 5-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 301 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.3
is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner unreasonably t o
annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, or that the
matter inquired about is privileged[.]” MCR 2.306(D)(1). If th e
deposition is terminated, only the court that is hearing the actio n
may order the deposition to resume. Id.
The court must suspend the deposition upon demand by a
deponent or the objecting party until that individual can file a
motion requesting termination or limited questioning. MCR
2.306(D)(3).
A party will be subject to costs under MCR 2.306(G), if he or sh e
plans to “assert that the matter to be inquired about is privileged,”
but fails to do so before the deposition. MCR 2.306(D)(4).
B. Deposition On Written Questions
9
Similar to MCR 2.305(A) and MCR 2.306(A), a party may tak e
testimony by deposition on written questions of any person,
10
including another party. MCR 2.307(A)(1). A non-party witnes s
may be compelled to attend if subpoenaed pursuant to MCR
11
2.305. MCR 2.307(A)(1). This type of deposition “may be taken of a
public or private corporation or partnership or association or
governmental agency in accordance with the provisions of MCR
2.305(A)(6) or MCR 2.306(B)(3).” MCR 2.307(A)(1).
A notice must accompany the written questions when being served
on a party, and a subpoena must accompany written question s
being served on a non-party. MCR 2.305(A)(1); MCR 2.307(A)(2).
Subject to the time requirements in MCR 2.307(A)(3), a nonmovin g
party has the opportunity to serve cross and recross questions, and
the moving party has an opportunity to serve redirect questions.
MCR 2.307(A)(3). These time requirements may be altered if th e
parties stipulate or for cause shown. Id.
C. Non-Party Subpoena for Deposition
The procedure for issuing a subpoena to a non-party for a
deposition depends on whether the party issuing the subpoena i s
12
represented by an attorney. See MCR 2.305(A)(1). A represented
9 See Section 5.3(A) for more information on the circumstances identified in MCR 2.305(A) and MC R
2.306(A).
10The deposition on written questions is subject to the scope of discovery discussed in Section 5.1(A).
11“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.305], a subpoena issued under [MCR 2.305] ma y
require a party or witness to appear by telephone or by videoconferencing technology. Telephonic
proceedings are subject to the provisions of MCR 2.402, and videoconference proceedings are subject t o
the provisions of MCR 2.407.” MCR 2.305(F).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-19
=== Page 302 ===
Section 5.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
party may issue the subpoena “upon court order or after all partie s
have had a reasonable opportunity to obtain an attorney, a s
determined under MCR 2.306(A).” MCR 2.305(A)(1). An
unrepresented party may make a motion in court for issuance of a
non-party subpoena. Id.
MCR 2.306(B)(1)-(2) and MCR 2.306(C)-(G) apply to a non-part y
subpoena under MCR 2.305. MCR 2.305(A)(1).
A subpoena issued to a non-party is subject to the rules in MCR
2.302(C) (regarding protective orders). MCR 2.305(A)(4). “[T]he
court in which the action is pending or in which the subpoena i s
served, on timely motion made by a party or the subpoenaed non-
party before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, may
(a) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable o r
oppressive;
(b) enter an order permitted by MCR 2.302(C); or
(c) conditionally deny the motion on prepayment by th e
party on whose behalf the subpoena is issued of th e
reasonable cost of producing documents, or other
tangible things.” MCR 2.305(A)(4).
“The non-party’s obligation to respond to the subpoena is stayed
until the motion is resolved.” MCR 2.305(A)(4).
“Except for a subpoena for delivery of copies of documents only
under [MCR 2.305(A)(2)], a non-party served with a subpoena i n
Michigan may be required to comply with the subpoena only in the
county where the deponent resides, is employed, has its principal
place of business or transacts relevant business; or at the location o f
the things to be inspected or land to be entered; or at another
convenient place specified by order of the court.” MCR 2.305(B).
D. Payment of Deposition Expenses
The court may order a party to pay another party’s reasonable
expenses associated with appearing at the deposition site, including
13
reasonable attorney fees if the party giving the notice of th e
deposition (1) fails to attend the deposition, or (2) fails to subpoena
a witness for the deposition, and (3) another party attends the

require a party or witness to appear by telephone or by videoconferencing technology. Telephonic
proceedings are subject to the provisions of MCR 2.402, and videoconference proceedings are subject t o
the provisions of MCR 2.407.” MCR 2.305(F).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.4
deposition in person or by attorney in reliance on the notice. MCR
2.306(G)(1)-(2).
5.4 Interrogatories
The use of interrogatories is only available to parties. See MCR
2.309(A)(1). Without leave of court, written interrogatories may be served
on the plaintiff once the action has commenced. MCR 2.309(A)(1)(a). Th e
defendant may be served with interrogatories “with or after the servic e
of the summons and complaint on that defendant.” MCR 2.309(A)(1)(b).
“Each separately represented party may serve no more than twent y
interrogatories upon each party. A discrete subpart of an interrogator y
counts as a separate interrogatory.” MCR 2.309(A)(2).
MCR 2.309(B) governs how and when a party must respond t o
interrogatories. The court may alter the timing rules. MCR 2.309(B)(4).
The court may also, for good cause, “excuse service [of the answers] o n
parties other than the party who served the interrogatories.” Id.
MCR 2.309(C) permits the party submitting interrogatories to file a
motion to compel discovery “under MCR 2.313(A) with respect to an
14
objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.” “If the motio n
is based on the failure to serve answers, proof of service of th e
interrogatories must be filed with the motion. The motion must state tha t
the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with th e
party not making the disclosure in an effort to secure the deposit withou t
court action.” MCR 2.309(C).
A letter from counsel does not constitute an answer that complies wit h
MCR 2.309(B), unless there is an agreement to accept the letter as th e
answer. Jilek v Stockson (On Remand), 297 Mich App 663, 668 (2012).
However, in the absence of an agreement, there is no discovery violatio n
if the party submitting the interrogatories did not file a motion to compel
under MCR 2.313(A). Jilek, 297 Mich App at 668.
5.5 Request for Documents
A. Generally
MCR 2.310 addresses the production of documents, tangible things,
ESI, and entry on land for inspection and other purposes. There is a
15
separate rule addressing medical records. See MCR 2.314.
14 See Section 5.11(A) for more information on filing motions to compel discovery.
15 See Section 5.9 for a discussion about medical records.

Section 5.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
B. Requests to Parties
A party may request that another party permit entry on land, or
produce and permit the requesting party or someone acting on tha t
party’s behalf:
“(i) to inspect and copy designated documents or
(ii) to inspect and copy, test, or sample other tangible
things that constitute or contain matters within th e
scope of MCR 2.302(B) and that are in possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the request i s
served[.]” MCR 2.310(B).
“The request may, without leave of court be served on the plaintif f
after commencement of the action and on the defendant with or
after the service of the summons and complaint on that defendant.”
MCR 2.310(C)(1). The request must list the requested item s
individually or by category and must describe each with reasonable
particularity. Id. In addition, the request must include “a reasonable
time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing
the related acts, as well as the form or forms in which electronically
stored information is to be produced, subject to objection.” Id.
Generally, the party served with the request must serve a writte n
response within 28 days after being served. MCR 2.310(C)(2).
However, if the served party is the defendant, he or she has 42 days
after the summons and complaint are served to serve a writte n
response. Id. The court may alter the response time. Id. See MCR
2.310(C)(2) for more information on the content of responses and
objections.
Documents should be produced as kept in the usual course of
business or organized and labeled to correspond to the categorie s
requested. MCR 2.310(C)(5). Similarly, where the request is for
electronically stored information, and it does not specify the form or
forms in which the information is to be produced, the informatio n
must be produced “in a form or forms in which the party ordinarily
maintains it, or in a form or forms that is or are reasonably usable.”
MCR 2.310(C)(2). The responding party only needs to “produce th e
same information in one form.” Id.
The requesting party may move for an order compelling discovery
pursuant to MCR 2.313(A) in the absence of a response, upo n
objection to the request, or upon failure to permit inspection. MCR
2.310(C)(3). In the motion, the moving party must state that he o r
she made a good faith effort to secure the disclosure before taking
court action. Id.
Page 5-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 305 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.5
“The party to whom the request is submitted may seek a protective
16
order under MCR 2.302(C).” MCR 2.310(C)(4).
Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the party who produces the
items for inspection is responsible for assembly costs, and the party
requesting the items is responsible for any copying costs. MCR
2.310(C)(6).
C. Requests on Nonparties
Upon court order, or after all parties have had a reasonable
opportunity to obtain an attorney as determined under MCR
2.306(A), a party may issue a subpoena (or request the court issue a
subpoena if the party is unrepresented) to a non-party for entry o n
land, or production or inspection of documents, tangible things, o r
ESI. MCR 2.305(A)(1). MCR 2.506(A)(2)-(3) apply to a request t o
produce ESI, and MCR 2.506(I) applies to a subpoena for hospital
records. MCR 2.305(A)(1). Service of the subpoena must confor m
with MCR 2.506(G), and a copy of the subpoena must be served o n
all other parties on the date of issuance. MCR 2.305(A)(5). A
17
subpoena issued under MCR 2.305 is subject to the provisions of
MCR 2.302(C) (protective orders). MCR 2.305(A)(4). See Sectio n
5.11(B) for information on protective orders.
If the person does not permit inspection or entry within the tim e
specified in the subpoena, which may not be less than 14 days after
the request is served unless a shorter period is ordered by the court,
the requesting party may file a motion to compel. MCR 2.305(A)(3).
“The motion must include a copy of the request and proof of service
of the subpoena,” and the “movant must serve the motion on the
non-party as provided in MCR 2.105.” MCR 2.305(A)(3). See Sectio n
5.11 for information on discovery motions.
“Upon written request from another party and payment of
reasonable copying costs,” a party that subpoenaed items from a
non-party must “provide copies of documents received pursuant t o
a subpoena.” MCR 2.305(A)(7).
16See Section 5.11(B) regarding motions for protective orders.
17“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.305], a subpoena issued under [MCR 2.305] ma y
require a party or witness to appear by telephone or by videoconferencing technology. Telephonic
proceedings are subject to the provisions of MCR 2.402, and videoconference proceedings are subject t o
the provisions of MCR 2.407.” MCR 2.305(F).

Section 5.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
D. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision whether to order a party to produce relevant,
nonprivileged documents is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
Davis v O’Brien, 152 Mich App 495, 504-505 (1986).
5.6 Foreign Subpoenas
18
The Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (UIDDA)
governs the issuance of a subpoena under the authority of a cour t
situated outside Michigan – a foreign subpoena. See MCL 600.2201 et seq.
“To request issuance of a subpoena under [MCL 600.2203], a party mus t
submit a foreign subpoena to the clerk of the circuit court in the county i n
which discovery is sought to be conducted in this state. A request for th e
issuance of a subpoena under [MCL 600.2201 et seq.] does not constitut e
an appearance in the courts of this state.” MCL 600.2203(1).
“When a party submits a foreign subpoena to a clerk of the circuit cour t
in this state, the clerk, in accordance with the court’s procedures, shall
promptly issue a subpoena for service upon the person to which the
foreign subpoena is directed.” MCL 600.2203(2). A subpoena under MCL
600.2203(2) must “(a) [i]ncorporate the terms used in the foreig n
subpoena, [and] (b) [c]ontain or be accompanied by the names,
addresses, and telephone numbers of all counsel of record in th e
proceeding to which the subpoena relates and of any party no t
represented by counsel.” MCL 600.2203(3).
“A subpoena issued by a clerk of the circuit court under [MCL 600.2203]
shall be served in compliance with Michigan court rules.” MCL
19
600.2204.
“Michigan court rules and statutes of this state applicable to complianc e
with subpoenas and requests for the production of documents and thing s
or entry on land apply to subpoenas issued under [MCL 600.2203].” MCL
600.2205.
“A motion for a protective order or an order to enforce, quash, or modif y
a subpoena issued by a clerk of the circuit court under [MCL 600.2203]
shall comply with Michigan court rules and be submitted to the circui t
court in the county in which discovery is to be conducted.” MCL
20
600.2206.
18 Effective April 1, 2013, 2012 PA 362 enacted the UIDDA, which applies to requests for discovery in
actions pending on April 1, 2013. MCL 600.2208.
19See Section 3.4 regarding process of service.
Page 5-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 307 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.7
“In applying [MCL 600.2201 et seq.], consideration shall be given to th e
need to promote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matte r
among the states that enact the [UIDDA].” MCL 600.2207.
5.7 Medical Examinations
A. Generally
“When the mental or physical condition (including the blood
group) of a party, or of a person in the custody or under the legal
control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action i s
pending may order the party to submit to a physical or mental or
blood examination by a physician (or other appropriate
professional) or to produce for examination the person in the party’ s
custody or legal control.” MCR 2.311(A). Some statutes also requir e
an examination under certain circumstances. See e.g., MCL
500.3151, which requires a person to submit to mental or physical
examination at the request of an insurer when the person’s mental
or physical condition is material to a claim for past or future
personal protection insurance benefits. In the context of no-faul t
cases, it has been determined that the No-Fault Act, not MCR
2.311(A), governs any conditions placed on independent medical
examinations. See Muci v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 478 Mich 17 8
(2007). The rest of this section discusses medical examinations in the
context of the general rules governing medical examinations (MCR
2.311 and MCL 600.1445). Discussion of medical examinations in
particular types of cases governed by particular acts is beyond the
scope of this section.
“The order may be entered only on motion for good cause wit h
notice to the person to be examined and to all parties.” MCR
2.311(A). See also MCL 600.1445(1). “In the context of our cour t
rules, ‘[g]ood cause simply means a satisfactory, sound or valid
reason[.]’ A trial court has broad discretion to determine wha t
constitutes ‘good cause.’” Thomas M Cooley Law Sch v Doe, 300 Mich
App 245, 264 (2013) (alterations in original). “‘[W]hat may be good
cause for one type of examination may not be so for another. The
ability of the movant to obtain the desired information by other means is
also relevant.’” Burris v KAM Transp, Inc, 301 Mich App 482, 48 9
(2013), quoting Schlagenhauf v Holder, 379 US 104, 118-119 (1964)
(alteration added) (interpreting FR Civ P 35, the federal counterpar t
to MCR 2.311). In the context of determining whether good cause
exists to grant a request for additional independent medical
examinations, the trial court should consider the number of
20See Section 5.11(B) regarding protective orders.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-25
=== Page 308 ===
Section 5.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
previous examinations, whether a subsequent examination i s
duplicative and/or necessary, as well as the passage of time since the
previous examination(s). See Burris, 301 Mich App at 492-493.
“The order must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and
scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is t o
be made. Upon request of a party, the order may also provide tha t
(1) the attorney for the person to be examined may be present at the
examination, or (2) a mental examination be recorded by video or
audio.” MCR 2.311(A). “If the court orders that a menta l
examination be recorded, the recording must (1) be unobtrusive, (2)
capture the examinee’s and the examiner’s conduct throughout the
examination, and (3) be filed under seal.” MCR 2.311(B).
B. Report of Physician, Physician’s Assistant, or Certified
Nurse Practitioner
A copy of the report and findings by the examining licensed
physician, licensed physician’s assistant, or certified nurse
practitioner must be provided to the person examined or his or her
attorney. MCL 600.1445(3). See also MCR 2.311(C)(1), whic h
requires the party requesting the examination to deliver the report s
and findings under certain circumstances. The party requesting the
examination may request a copy of a similar report from any
previous or subsequent examinations made regarding the same
condition. MCR 2.311(C)(2).
If a physician fails to comply with MCR 2.311, the court may order
the physician to appear for a discovery deposition. MCR 2.311(C)(3).
C. Privilege
By requesting and obtaining a report of an examination ordered
pursuant to MCR 2.311, or by deposing the examiner, “the person
examined waives any privilege he or she may have in that action, or
another action involving the same controversy, regarding the
testimony of every other person who has examined or may
thereafter examine the person as to the same mental or physical
21
condition.” MCR 2.311(C)(4).
D. Standard of Review
A court’s decision whether to grant an order requiring the mental or
physical examination of a party or its agent is reviewed for an abuse
21See Section 5.10 for a discussion of privileged materials.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.8
of discretion. Burris v KAM Transp, Inc, 301 Mich App 482, 487
(2013).
5.8 Request for Admission
A. Purpose
The purpose of MCR 2.312 is “to limit the areas of controversy and
to conserve resources that otherwise would be spent amassing
proofs.” Radtke v Miller, Canfield, Paddock & Stone, 453 Mich 413, 42 5
(1996).
B. Timing and Requirements
“Within the time for completion of discovery, a party may serve o n
another party a written request for the admission[.]” MCR 2.312(A).
“The request must clearly identify in the caption and before eac h
request that it is a Request for Admission,” and “[e]ach matter of
which an admission is requested must be stated separately.” Id.
A matter will be deemed admitted if the nonmoving party does no t
serve a response within 28 days after the request was served. MCR
2.312(B)(1). If the nonmoving party is a defendant, he or she has 4 2
days after being served with the summons and complaint to serve a
response to an admissions request. Id. The court may alter respons e
times at its discretion. Id.
C. Scope
Admissions under MCR 2.312(A) are written requests seeking th e
truth of a matter within the scope of discovery relating to statement s
or opinions of fact or the application of law to fact. MCR 2.312(A).
However, requesting that the defendant admit to the basis of the
plaintiff’s claim is not a proper subject for admission where the
defendant reasonably believes he or she may prevail on the claim.
Richardson v Ryder Truck Rental, Inc, 213 Mich App 447, 457-45 8
(1995).
D. Response
A party served with a request for admission has several options i n
responding to the request. Radtke v Miller, Canfield, Paddock & Stone,
453 Mich 413, 419 (1996). The party may (1) make an expres s
admission, (2) do nothing (in which case it will be deemed a n
admission), (3) deny the matter, in whole or in part, (4) explain why
a response is impossible, or (5) object to the request. Id. “Gratuitou s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-27

Section 5.8 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
statements that are beyond the scope of a request do not constitute
conclusively binding judicial admissions under MCR 2.312, and ar e
not precluded by [MCR 2.312(D)(2)] from being used in othe r
proceedings.” Radtke, 453 Mich at 426.
If the party does not respond or object within the time frame
outlined in MCR 2.312(B)(1), the matter is admitted. MCR
2.312(B)(1). An admission is conclusive unless the court, in its
discretion, permits amendment or withdrawal. MCR 2.312(D)(1).
A party may be allowed to file late answers to an opposing party’ s
request for admission. Janczyk v Davis, 125 Mich App 683, 692-69 3
(1983). The trial judge should balance three factors when decidin g
whether to permit a late answer: (1) whether it will aid in the
presentation of the action; (2) whether the other party would be
prejudiced by a late answer; and (3) the reason for the delay. Id. The
Court cautioned:
“When a trial judge is asked to decide whether or not t o
allow a party to file late answers to the request fo r
admissions, he is in effect called upon to balanc e
between the interests of justice and diligence i n
litigation. . . . ‘The severity of the sanctions should b e
tempered by a consideration of the equities involved.’ I n
other words, a rigid rule is sometimes unjustified; bu t
too lenient a rule will undermine the policy of the cour t
rule itself.” Janczyk, 125 Mich App at 691-692 (internal
citations omitted).
The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the
defendants to amend their answer where the plaintiff was give n
ample opportunity to conduct discovery after the trial court’ s
decision (in fact, discovery was subsequently reopened at the
plaintiff’s request—to depose another witness), and the defendants’
late discovery of documents critical to the lawsuit (i.e. the reaso n
they sought to amend their answer) was inadvertent. Bailey v Schaaf,
293 Mich App 611, 622-623 (2011), aff’d in part, vacated in part o n
22
other grounds 494 Mich 595 (2013). The Court stated that “[t]h e
situation here—in which two parties later learned that timely, initial
responses had inadvertently failed to account for critical
documents—is precisely the kind of possibility the reservation of
trial court discretion in MCR 2.312(D)(1) addresses.” Bailey, 293
Mich App at 623.

note.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.8
E. Effect
Admissions under MCR 2.312 are judicial admissions, no t
evidentiary admissions. Radtke v Miller, Canfield, Paddock & Stone,
453 Mich 413, 420 (1996). A judicial admission is conclusive,
whereas an evidentiary admission is not. Id. at 420-421. Evidentiary
admissions are subject to contradiction or explanation. Id. at 421.
Admissions under MCR 2.312 (judicial admissions) must be
narrowly construed. Hilgendorf v St John Hosp and Med Ctr Corp, 24 5
Mich App 670, 690 (2001). “Only that portion of the response tha t
directly meets and admits the request is a judicial admission under
MCR 2.312, so that it is conclusively binding for the pending action
and may not be used as evidence in other proceedings.” Radtke, 453
Mich at 425. Judicial admissions may be considered for purposes of
ruling on a motion for summary disposition. Employers Mut Cas Co v
Petroleum Equip, Inc, 190 Mich App 57, 61-62 (1991). See also MCR
2.116(G)(5), which allows summary disposition motions made
pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(1)-(7) or MCR 2.116(C)(10) to b e
supported by admissions.
The procedures in MCR 2.312 are not self-executing; the part y
seeking to rely upon any conclusive admission must bring the issue
to the trial court’s attention before the close of proofs. Radtke, 453
Mich at 421 n 7. However, neither the court rules nor the case law
require a party to file a motion before the court can deem the
request admitted.
F. Sanction for Failure to Admit
“If a party denies the genuineness of a document, or the truth of a
matter as requested under MCR 2.312, and if the party requesting
the admission later proves the genuineness of the document or the
truth of the matter,” the court must grant a motion by the requesting
party for expenses incurred in making the proof, unless it finds tha t
(1) the request was found objectionable under MCR 2.312, (2) th e
admission sought was not substantially important, (3) the failin g
party had reasonable grounds to believe he or she may have
prevailed on the matter, or (4) some other good reason existed for
failing to admit. MCR 2.313(C)(2).
“The mere fact that the matter was proved at trial does not, of itself,
establish that the denial in response to the request for an admissio n
was unreasonable.” King v Mich State Police Dep’t, 303 Mich App 162,
182 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (the trial
court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to the plaintiff s
as a discovery sanction because the plaintiffs did not prove the trut h
of the matter that was the subject of the requests for admissions).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-29
=== Page 312 ===
Section 5.9 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
G. Standard of Review
The court’s decision to allow a party to amend a response, withdraw
a response, or file a late response is reviewed for an abuse of
discretion. Janczyk v Davis, 125 Mich App 683, 691 (1983).
5.9 Party’s Medical Information
If a party’s mental or physical condition is in controversy, medical
information regarding the condition may be discoverable as long as it i s
discoverable under MCR 2.302(B) (scope of discovery), and the party
does not assert a valid privilege to prevent discovery of the medical
information. MCR 2.314(A)(1)(a)-(b).
Discoverable medical information “includes, but is not limited to,
medical records in the possession or control of a physician, hospital, o r
other custodian, and medical knowledge discoverable by deposition o r
interrogatories.” MCR 2.314(A)(2). The party is considered to be in
control of his or her own medical information even if the party does no t
have immediate physical possession of it. MCR 2.314(A)(3).
When a party is served with a request for medical information, the part y
must:
• make the information available,
• assert a privilege,
• object to the request, or
• provide the requesting party with the location of the
information and a sufficient number of signed
authorizations so that the requesting party can obtain the
information from the individual or entity that possesses the
information. MCR 2.314(C)(1)(a)-(d); MCR 2.314(C)(2).
A party with a valid privilege may assert it to prevent discovery o f
medical information regarding his or her mental or physical condition.
MCR 2.314(B)(1). See also MCR 2.302(B)(1). A privilege that is no t
23
asserted in a timely manner is waived in that action only. MCR
2.314(B)(1). See also MCR 2.306(D)(4). “Unless the court order s
otherwise, if a party asserts that the medical information is subject to a
privilege and the assertion has the effect of preventing discovery o f
23“The privilege must be asserted in the party’s dislcosure under [MCR] 2.302(A), in written response to a
request for production of documents under MCR 2.310, in answers to interrogatories under MCR 2.309(B),
before or during the taking of a deposition, or by moving for a protective order under MCR 2.302(C).” MCR
2.314(B)(1).
Page 5-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 313 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.10
medical information that must be disclosed or is otherwise discoverable
under MCR 2.302(B), the party may not thereafter present or introduc e
any physical, documentary, or testimonial evidence relating to the party’ s
24
medical history or mental or physical condition.” MCR 2.314(B)(2).
If privileged or protected information is inadvertently produced durin g
discovery, “the party making the claim [of privilege] may notify an y
party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. ”
MCR 2.302(B)(7). Once a receiving party is on notice, that party “mus t
promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and an y
copies it has and may not use or disclose the information until the clai m
is resolved. A receiving party may promptly present the information t o
the court under seal for a determination of the claim.” Id. If a receiving
party disclosed the information before the producing party provided
notice of the claim, the receiving party must take reasonable steps t o
retrieve the information. Id. “The producing party must preserve th e
information until the claim is resolved. Id.
5.10 Privileged Materials
A. Medical Records
MCR 2.314 addresses the mechanism used for discovering medica l
information where the condition of a party is in controversy.
Medical information of nonparties is not discoverable under MCR
2.314. MCR 2.314(E).
Custodians of medical information must comply with a proper
request within 28 days after receiving the request, or if the party i s
hospitalized for the condition for which the request was made,
within 28 days after he or she is released. MCR 2.314(D)(1). Th e
court may alter this time limit for good cause. Id.
To be considered compliant, the custodian must:
• make the information reasonably available, or
• deliver a properly verified original or true and exac t
copy of the original information to the requesting
party, as provided in MCR 2.314(D)(2)(b). MCR
2.314(D)(2)(a)-(b).
If the custodian does not comply with the request, a subpoena may
be issued pursuant to MCR 2.305(A). MCR 2.314(D)(6). See als o
MCR 2.305(A)(1).
24 See Section 5.10(A) for more information on asserting a privilege regarding medical information.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-31
=== Page 314 ===
Section 5.10 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
The requesting party must pay the custodian reasonable
reimbursement in advance for the expense of complying. MCR
2.314(D)(5). In determining what constitutes a reasonable expense ,
the Michigan Court of Appeals gave the following guidance:
“At a minimum, . . . [the custodian] should reveal ho w
many copies are made per year in response to request s
occasioned solely by paying requestors, as well as th e
total number of copies made per year by [the custodian ]
for paying, nonpaying, and any other requestors. Onc e
these amounts are revealed, they may be compared t o
the total, itemized labor and machine maintenance cost s
incurred by [the custodian]. Those latter costs may b e
divided in proportion to the number of copies made fo r
paying requestors and the number of copies made fo r
nonpaying and other requestors. A reasonable per-pag e
amount is then easily calculated by dividing the numbe r
of copies made for paying requestors into the pro rat a
amount of expenses incurred attributable to all payin g
requestors.” Graham v Thompson, 167 Mich App 371, 375
(1988).
B. Hospital Records
In determining whether a privilege applies to certain hospital
documents, two sections of the Public Health Code may play a role.
The peer review privilege statutes, MCL 333.20175(13) (applicable t o
health facilities, health agencies, and certain institutions of higher
education) and MCL 333.21515 (applicable to hospitals and certai n
universities), both state essentially the same thing:
“The records, data, and knowledge collected for or b y
individuals or committees assigned a professiona l
review function in a health facility or agency, or a n
institution of higher education in [Michigan] that ha s
colleges of osteopathic and human medicine, ar e
confidential, must be used only for the purpose s
provided in this article, are not public records, and are
25
not subject to court subpoena.” MCL 333.20175(13).
See also MCL 333.21515.
“The scope of the [peer review] privilege is not without limit.”
Krusac v Covenant Med Ctr, Inc, 497 Mich 251, 261 (2015). “[T]he
privilege only applies to records, data, and knowledge that are
collected for or by the committee under [MCL 333.20175(13) and
25MCL 333.20175 “does not apply to a health facility or agency that is a health maintenance organization.”
MCL 333.20175(14).

MCL 333.21515] ‘for the purpose of reducing morbidity an d
mortality and improving the care provided in the hospital for
26
patients.’” Krusac, 497 Mich at 261-262, quoting MCL 333.21513(d).
“In determining whether any of the information requested i s
protected by the statutory privilege, the trial court should bear i n
mind that mere submission of information to a peer review
[27]
committee does not satisfy the collection requirement so as t o
bring the information within the protection of the statute. Also, i n
deciding whether a particular committee was assigned a review
function so that information it collected is protected, the court may
wish to consider the hospital’s bylaws and internal regulations, and
whether the committee’s function is one of current patient care or
retrospective review.” Monty v Warren Hosp Corp, 422 Mich 138, 146-
147 (1985) (citations omitted). Moreover, litigants “may still obtai n
relevant facts through eyewitness testimony, including from the
author of a privileged incident report, and from the patient’ s
medical record.” Krusac, 497 Mich at 262.
“Nothing in the pertinent language of [MCL 333.20175(13)] suggest s
that the privilege does not extend to a freestanding surgical
outpatient facility exercising the same credentialing-review functio n
under MCL 333.20813(c) that a hospital performs under MCL
333.21513(c).” Dorsey v Surgical Institute of Mich, LLC, 338 Mich App
28
199, 228 (2021). MCL 333.21515 references Article 17, “which
governs a wide variety of health facilities or agencies, including
freestanding surgical outpatient facilities. However, the specifi c
provision is set forth in Part 215 of Article 17, which addresse s
matters related to the narrower category of entities that constitute
hospitals.” Dorsey, 338 Mich App at 228. “[D]espite the placement of
MCL 333.21515 in Part 215 alongside other provisions applicable t o
hospitals, the Legislature’s reference to the review functions i n
Article 17, as opposed to Part 215, evidences its intent to extend the
statutory privilege for peer-review materials to all health facilitie s
and agencies with review functions imposed by Article 17.” Dorsey,
338 Mich App at 229 (concluding the peer review privilege in MCL
333.21515 applied to defendant (a freestanding surgical outpatien t
facility), that “[t]he plain language of [MCL 333.20175(13)] limited
the use of [the credentialing file] to purposes provided in Article

have been admitted at trial”).
C. Personnel Records
Disclosure of personnel records is governed by the Bullard-
Plawecki Employee Right to Know Act. MCL 423.501 et seq. The Ac t
defines “personnel records” as:
“[A] record kept by the employer that identifies the
employee, to the extent that the record is used or ha s
been used, or may affect or be used relative to tha t
employee’s qualifications for employment, promotion,
transfer, additional compensation, or disciplinar y
action. A personnel record shall include a record in th e
possession of a person, corporation, partnership, o r
other association who has a contractual agreement wit h
the employer to keep or supply a personnel record a s
provided in this subdivision. A personnel record shal l
not include:
(i) Employee references supplied to an employer if
the identity of the person making the reference
would be disclosed.
(ii) Materials relating to the employer’s staff
planning with respect to more than 1 employee,
including salary increases, management bonu s
plans, promotions, and job assignments.
(iii) Medical reports and records made or obtained
by the employer if the records or reports are
available to the employee from the doctor or
medical facility involved.
(iv) Information of a personal nature about a
person other than the employee if disclosure of the
information would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of the other person’ s
privacy.
(v) Information that is kept separately from other
records and that relates to an investigation by the
employer pursuant to [MCL 423.509].
(vi) Records limited to grievance investigation s
which are kept separately and are not used for the
purposes provided in this subdivision.
Page 5-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 317 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.10
(vii) Records maintained by an educational
institution which are directly related to a studen t
and are considered to be education records under
section 513(a) of title 5 of the family educational
rights and privacy act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. 1232g.
(viii) Records kept by an executive, administrative,
or professional employee that are kept in the sole
possession of the maker of the record, and are no t
accessible or shared with other persons. However,
a record concerning an occurrence or fact about a n
employee kept pursuant to this subparagraph may
be entered into a personnel record if entered no t
more than 6 months after the date of the
occurrence or the date the fact becomes known.”
MCL 423.501(2)(c).
Information that is not included in the personnel file, but should
have been included, cannot be used by an employer in a judicial or
quasi-judicial proceeding unless the employee requests it or unles s
the exclusion was inadvertent and the employee agrees to its use or
has been given a reasonable amount of time to review the
information. MCL 423.502. Employees may review their record afte r
submitting a written request. MCL 423.503. Generally, an employe e
is limited to viewing his or her personnel file “not more than 2 time s
in a calendar year or as otherwise provided by law or a collective
bargaining agreement[.]” Id. Employers may charge the employee a
fee, limited to the actual incremental cost, for providing a copy of
the personnel file. MCL 423.504.
An employer or former employer may not disclose an employee’ s
disciplinary reports or reprimands to (1) third parties, (2) anyone
who is not part of the employer’s organization, or (3) anyone who i s
not part of the labor organization representing the employee,
without providing proper written notice to the employee. MCL
423.506. An employer must review a personnel file and “delet e
disciplinary reports, letters of reprimand, or other records of
disciplinary action which are more than 4 years old” before
releasing information to a third party, unless the release is ordered
pursuant to a legal action or arbitration which involves the third
party. MCL 423.507.
D. Trade Secrets
Discovery of trade secrets is generally addressed under MCR
2.302(C)(8), which states:
“(C) Protective Orders. On motion by a party or by th e
person from whom discovery is sought, and o n

reasonable notice and for good cause shown, the cour t
in which the action is pending may issue any order tha t
justice requires to protect a party or person fro m
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undu e
burden or expense, including one or more of th e
following orders:
* * *
(8) that a trade secret or other confidential
research, development, or commercial informatio n
not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a
29
designated way[.]”
E. Work Product and Attorney-Client Privilege
30
“Subject to the provisions of [MCR 2.302(B)(4) ], a party ma y
obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise
discoverable under [MCR 2.302(B)(1)] and prepared in anticipatio n
of litigation or for trial by or for another party or another party’ s
representative (including an attorney, consultant, surety,
indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only on a showing that the party
seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the
preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship t o
obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means. I n
ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been
made, the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions,
conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other
representative of a party concerning the litigation.” MCR 2.302(B)(3)(a)
(emphasis added).
Regardless of the form of recorded drafts or communications, MCR
2.302(B)(3)(a) “protects drafts of any interrogatory answer required
under [MCR 2.302(B)(4)(a)(i)]” and “communications between th e
party’s attorney and any expert witness under [MCR
2.302(B)(4)], . . . except to the extent that the communications: (i)
relate to compensation for the expert’s study or testimony; (ii)
identify facts or data that the party’s attorney provided and that the
expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or (iii)
identify assumptions that the party’s attorney provided and that the
expert relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.” MCR
2.302(B)(4)(e)-(f).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.10
The Michigan Court of Appeals has recognized the importance of
protecting an attorney’s work product:
“[T]he balancing of the policy favoring complet e
discovery and that favoring preserving attorney-clien t
confidences weigh[s] in favor of allowing a part y
seeking discovery of attorney work product to proceed
only upon a showing of substantial need for th e
materials sought plus inability to obtain the informatio n
without undue hardship.” Messenger v Ingham C o
Prosecutor, 232 Mich App 633, 638 (1998).
“The work product doctrine seeks to protect an attorney’s freedo m
to generate documents and records in order to facilitate full
preparation of his case.” Great Lakes Concrete Pole Corp v Eash, 14 8
Mich App 649, 656 (1986).
“‘[I]f a party demonstrates the substantial need and undue hardship
necessary to discover work product, that party may discover only
factual, not deliberative, work product.’” Augustine v Allstate Ins Co,
292 Mich App 408, 421 (2011), quoting Leibel v Gen Motors Corp, 25 0
Mich App 229, 247 (2002).
Voluntary disclosure of privileged materials to a third party
generally results in waiver of the privilege because “such actio n
necessarily runs the risk the third party may reveal it, either
inadvertently or under examination by an adverse party[.]”
D’Alessandro Contracting Group, LLC v Wright, 308 Mich App 71, 8 1
(2014) (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, thi s
“principle is not ironclad[.]” Id. (citation omitted). “[W]here work
product is prepared for certain third parties, the qualified privilege
may be retained.” Id.; MCR 2.302(B)(3)(a). Further, even when
material is not prepared by or for a specific party, disclosure to a
third party will not result in waiver when the “common-interes t
doctrine” applies. D’Alessandro Contracting Group, LLC, 308 Mic h
App at 82. Thus, “the disclosure of work product to a third party
does not result in a waiver if there is a reasonable expectation of
confidentiality between the transferor . . . and the recipient[.]” Id.
(holding that the common-interest doctrine applied and the work
product privilege was not waived because the defendants had a
reasonable expectation of confidentiality in sharing the report wit h
the third party where the defendants and the third party had a n
indemnification agreement).
“[W]hether a party may assert the work-product privilege and
whether a party has waived that privilege are questions of law tha t
[are] review[ed] de novo.” D’Alessandro Contracting Group, LLC, 30 8
Mich App at 76. “A court’s factual findings underlying it s
determination of the existence and waiver of the work-produc t

privilege are reviewed for clear error.” Id. Once the reviewing cour t
has determined whether the privilege applies, it then reviews the
trial court’s order for an abuse of discretion. Id.
“Generally, a party in a civil lawsuit is not entitled to discovery o f
documents that are protected by the attorney-client privilege.”
Citizens Ins Co of America v Livingston Co Road Comm, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2022). “The attorney-client privilege is personal to the
client, and only the client can waive it.” Id. at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). “When analyzing whether a privilege ha s
been waived, a court should begin its analysis with a presumptio n
in favor of preserving the privilege.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). To show waiver, “the party seeking waiver mus t
demonstrate that the material to be discovered is relevant and tha t
the party’s assertion of the privilege seriously undermined the other
party’s position.” Id. at ___. “[A] privilege can be waived throug h
conduct that would make it unfair for the holder to insist on the
privilege thereafter.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “Thus, a waiver may be found when the privilege holder’ s
conduct places the claimant in such a position, with reference to th e
evidence that it would be unfair and inconsistent to permit the
retention of the privilege.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “[I]f the court permits discovery of the privileged
material, it should be narrowly limited to those portions of the
privileged material that bear directly on the issues at hand.” Id. a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Citizens, “defendant raised attorney-client privilege in
furtherance of its affirmative defenses,” asserting that “no binding
settlement agreement existed because its former lawyer lacked th e
authority to settle the case on [defendant’s] behalf.” Citizens, ___
Mich App at ___. “In doing so, [defendant] placed its lawyer’ s
settlement authority at issue.” Id. at ___. “In response, however,
plaintiffs offered evidence that the [defendant’s] former lawye r
represented in two e-mails that the [defendant] had approved th e
settlement agreement.” Id. at ___. “In light of the fact that the
communications between the [defendant] and its former lawye r
[were] relevant to the issue of whether he had authority to settle
based on [defendant’s] prior approval of the settlement agreement,
and given that there, in the absence of those communications,
plaintiffs’ ability to dispute that affirmative defense would b e
severely undermined,” the Court of Appeals concluded “that the
trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the attorney-
client privilege was waived.” Id. at ___ (remanding for in camera
review because “discovery allowed under these circumstance s
should be narrowly confined”).

5.11 Disclosure and Discovery Motions
Committee Tips:
Determine whether motion is routine or
•
complex. Does motion address failure to
disclose, failure to respond, or the response? If
the motion addresses failure to disclose or
respond, set deadline and possible
consequences.
If hearing is on objections to interrogatories,
•
or allegations of evasive or incomplete answers,
require submission of both interrogatories and
answers in advance, and require specificity in
motion.
Consider in camera review.
•
Consider alternative discovery methods
•
beyond those specified in the Michigan Court
Rules. See Reed Dairy Farm v Consumers Powe r
Co, 227 Mich App 614, 618 (1998), which uphel d
a trial court’s decision to allow the plaintiff to
submit interrogatories to nonparty expert
witnesses in lieu of expending time and money
traveling across the country questioning each
witness individually.
Consider whether to extend discovery.
•
Build a record.
•
A. Motion to Compel
Disclosure. The party seeking disclosure may file a motion t o
compel if a party fails to serve a disclosure as required by MCR
2.302(A). MCR 2.313(A)(2)(a).
Discovery. The party seeking discovery may file a motion to compe l
discovery if:
“(i) a deponent fails to answer a question propounded
or submitted under MCR 2.306 or [MCR] 2.307,
31The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(3) and
MCR 2.408(C)(3) to motions filed pursuant to MCR 2.119 regarding discovery. See Section 1.15 for more
information on videoconferencing.

(ii) a corporation or other entity fails to make a
designation under MCR 2.306(B)(3) or [MCR]
2.307(A)(1),
(iii) a party fails to answer an interrogatory submitted
under MCR 2.309(A) and [MCR 2.309](B),
(iv) in response to a request for inspection submitted
under MCR 2.310, a person fails to respond tha t
inspection will be permitted as requested, or
(v) If a party; an officer, director, or managing agent of a
party; or a person designated under MCR 2.306(B)(3) o r
[MCR] 2.307(A)(1) to testify on behalf of a party fails t o
appear before the person who is to take his or he r
deposition, after being served with a proper notice, th e
party seeking discovery may move for an orde r
compelling compliance. When taking a deposition o n
oral examination, the proponent of the question ma y
complete or adjourn the examination before applyin g
for an order.” MCR 2.313(A)(2)(b).
Non-party discovery subpoena. “If a recipient of a non-part y
[32]
discovery subpoena under MCR 2.305 fails to comply, the issuin g
party may move to compel compliance. When taking a depositio n
on oral examination, the proponent of the question may complete or
adjourn the examination before applying for an order. The motio n
must include a copy of the subpoena and proof of service of the
subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on the person fro m
whom discovery is sought as provided in MCR 2.105.” MCR
2.313(A)(2)(c).
1. Failure to Obey Order Compelling Discovery
“If a deponent fails to be sworn or answer a question” afte r
being ordered to do so by a court in the county or distric t
where the deposition is taking place, he or she may be found i n
contempt of court. MCR 2.313(B)(1).
If a party or other person listed in MCR 2.313(B)(2) fails to obe y
an order compelling discovery, the court where the action i s
pending may order any of the following sanctions, as ar e
33
just :
32“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.305], a subpoena issued under [MCR 2.305] ma y
require a party or witness to appear by telephone or by videoconferencing technology. Telephonic
proceedings are subject to the provisions of MCR 2.402, and videoconference proceedings are subject t o
the provisions of MCR 2.407.” MCR 2.305(F).
33 See Section 5.1() on determining an appropriate sanction.

=== Page 323 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.11
• Establish that certain matters and designated
facts stated in the moving party’s claim are true.
• Refuse to allow disobedient party to support or
oppose designated claims or defenses, or
introduce designated matters into evidence.
• Strike pleadings or parts of pleadings, stay
further proceedings until the order is obeyed,
dismiss the action or parts of it, or enter a
judgment by default.
• Find the nonmoving party in contempt of cour t
(either in addition to or in lieu of any other
sanctions). This sanction is not applicable t o
orders requiring a physical or mental
examination. MCR 2.313(B)(2)(a)-(d).
Sanctions listed under MCR 2.313(B)(2)(a)-(c) may be applied
to a person who has been ordered to and fails to produc e
another person for examination pursuant to MCR 2.311(A),
unless the disobedient person can show that he or she is unable
to produce the person for examination. MCR 2.313(B)(2)(e).
“[R]easonable expenses, including attorney fees, caused by th e
failure” may also be added to or substituted for any of the
sanctions listed in MCR 2.313(B)(2), “unless the court finds tha t
the failure was substantially justified or that othe r
34
circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.” MCR
2.313(B)(2). Expenses may be apportioned if the motion t o
compel is granted in part and denied in part. MCR
2.313(A)(5)(c). Both the party and the attorney may b e
sanctioned. MCR 2.313(A)(5); MCR 2.313(B)(2). See also Jackson
Co Hog Producers v Consumers Power Co, 234 Mich App 72, 89
(1999).
If the court orders the sanction of dismissal under MCR
2.313(B)(2)(c) for failure to provide or permit discovery, th e
dismissal serves as an adjudication on the merits pursuant t o
MCR 2.504(B)(3), unless the court specifies otherwise. Dawoud
v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, 317 Mich App 517, 523-524 (2016).
2. Failure to Preserve
“If ESI that should have been preserved in the anticipation or
conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to tak e
34See Section 5.12(A)(3) regarding an award of expenses.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-41
=== Page 324 ===
Section 5.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored o r
replaced through additional discovery, the court:
(1) upon finding prejudice to another party fro m
loss of the information, may order measures n o
greater than necessary to cure the prejudice or
(2) only upon finding that the party acted with the
intent to deprive another party of the information’ s
use in the litigation, may order appropriate
remedies, including:
(a) a presumption that the lost informatio n
was unfavorable to the party;
(b) a jury instruction directing that the jur y
may or must presume the information wa s
unfavorable to the party; or
(c) dismissal of the action or entry of a defaul t
35
judgment.” MCR 2.313(D).
3. Evidentiary Hearing
While a party may be sanctioned for failing to permi t
discovery, the party is entitled to an evidentiary hearing so tha t
both parties may introduce evidence alleging and rebutting th e
disobedient party’s willfulness and to what extent the othe r
party has been prejudiced by the failure. See Traxler v For d
Motor Co, 227 Mich App 276, 288 (1998).
4. Award of Expenses
Expenses awarded for filing the motion to compel. The cour t
may award reasonable expenses incurred as a result of th e
conduct and in making the motion, including attorney fees, t o
the moving party if the motion is granted, or the disclosure or
requested discovery is provided after the motion was filed,
unless the moving party filed the motion before attempting i n
good faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery without cour t
action. MCR 2.313(A)(5)(a). If the motion is denied, the cour t
may award reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, to th e
nonmoving party, unless filing the motion or opposing th e
motion was substantially justified or other circumstances mak e
36
an award of expenses unjust. MCR 2.313(A)(5)(b). “If th e
motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may,
35See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Evidence Benchbook, Chapter 1, for information regardin g
presumptions.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 5.11
after opportunity for hearing, apportion the reasonable
expenses incurred in relation to the motion among the partie s
and other persons in a just manner.” MCR 2.313(A)(5)(c). Th e
court may also order such sanctions it deems just, includin g
those authorized under MCR 2.313(B)(2)(a)-(c). MCR
2.313(A)(6).
“[T]he trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying th e
[plaintiff’s] motion for fees and costs related to defendants ’
motion to compel discovery” where it found that the motio n
was not “inappropriate” rather than expressly finding that th e
motion was “substantially justified” or that an award o f
expenses would be “unjust” under the circumstances. Cove
Creek Condo Ass’n v Vistal Land & Home Dev, LLC, 330 Mich Ap p
679, 719 (2019).
Expenses awarded for failing to comply with order
compelling discovery. The court must order the disobedien t
party to pay the other party’s “reasonable expenses, includin g
attorney fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds tha t
the failure was substantially justified or that othe r
circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.” MCR
2.313(B)(2).
B. Motions for Protective Orders
“Despite Michigan’s broad discovery policy, a trial court should
protect parties from excessive, abusive, or irrelevant discovery
requests.” Thomas M Cooley Law School v John Doe 1, 300 Mich App
245, 260-261 (2013). “To that end, [MCR 2.302(C)] allow[s] a party or
a person from whom discovery is sought to move for a protective
order.” Arabo v Mich Gaming Control Bd, 310 Mich App 370, 39 8
(2015). “The movant must demonstrate good cause for the issuance
of a protective order.” Id.
1. Basis
When a moving party has given reasonable notice and show n
good cause, the court “may issue any order that justic e
requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense[.] ”
MCR 2.302(C).
36 MCR 2.313(A)(5) also applies to motions for protective orders. MCR 2.302(C). See Section 5.11(B) for
more information on protective orders.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 5-43
=== Page 326 ===
Section 5.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
2. Types of Protective Orders
When issuing a protective order, the court may order one o r
more of the following:
• No discovery.
• Discovery on specified terms and conditions.
• Another method of discovery.
• Limit scope of discovery, including prohibiting
discovery of certain matters altogether.
• Limit people present at discovery.
• Require court order to open sealed depositions.
• Deposition for discovery and impeachmen t
purposes only.
• Nondisclosure or limited disclosure of trade
secrets, confidential research, development, or
commercial information.
• Simultaneous filing of specified documents i n
sealed envelopes, to be opened as directed by the
court. MCR 2.302(C)(1)-(9).
“A protective order issued under MCR 2.302(C) may authorize
parties to file materials under seal in accordance with th e
provisions of the protective order without the necessity o f
filing a motion to seal under [MCR 8.119].” MCR 8.119(I)(8).
“Any person may file a motion . . . to unseal a document file d
under seal pursuant to MCR 2.302(C)[.]” MCR 8.119(I)(9). A
motion to unseal is governed by MCR 2.119. MCR 8.119(I)(9).
3. Denial of Motion for Protective Order
“If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or i n
part, the court may, on terms and conditions as are just, orde r
that a party or person provide or permit discovery.” MCR
2.302(C).
4. Award of Expenses
MCR 2.313(A)(5) governs the award of expenses for protectiv e
order motions. See MCR 2.302(C). The court may award
reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the conduct and i n
making the motion, including attorney fees, to the movin g

party if the motion is granted, or the disclosure or requested
discovery is provided after the motion was filed, unless th e
moving party filed the motion before attempting in good fait h
to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action.
MCR 2.313(A)(5)(a). If the motion is denied, the court ma y
award reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, to th e
nonmoving party, unless filing the motion or opposing th e
motion was substantially justified or other circumstances mak e
37
an award of expenses unjust. MCR 2.313(A)(5)(b). “If th e
motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court ma y
apportion the reasonable expenses incurred in relation to th e
motion among the parties and other persons in a just manner. ”
MCR 2.313(A)(5)(c).
C. Standard of Review
A court’s decision regarding the imposition of discovery sanction s
and the amount of attorney fees awarded is reviewed for an abus e
of discretion. McDonald v Grand Traverse Co Election Comm, 255 Mich
App 674, 697 (2003). However, a court’s decision whether to awar d
attorney fees is reviewed for clear error. Id.
A court’s decision to grant or deny a protective order limiting
discovery is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. P T Today, Inc v
Comm’r of Office of Fin & Ins Svcs, 270 Mich App 110, 151 (2006).
Whether a trial court “applied the correct legal standards i n
determining whether to issue a protective order in the first place” i s
reviewed de novo. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs v Genesee Circui t
Judge, 318 Mich App 395, 407 (2016).
5.12 Disclosure of Witnesses
A. Witness Lists
“Witness lists are an element of discovery.” Grubor Enterprises, Inc v
Kortidis, 201 Mich App 625, 628 (1993). They serve the purpose of
avoiding “‘trial by surprise.’” Id., quoting Stepp v Dep’t of Nat
Resources, 157 Mich App 774, 779 (1987).
The parties must file and serve their witness lists within the time
limits prescribed by the court under MCR 2.401(B)(2)(a). MCR
2.401(I)(1). The witness list should include the witness’s name,
address (if known), whether the witness is an expert, and his or her
37 MCR 2.313(A)(5) also applies to motions for protective orders. MCR 2.302(C). See Section 5.11(B) for
more information on protective orders.

field of expertise. MCR 2.401(I)(1)(a)-(b). However, only a general
identification is necessary if the witness is a records custodia n
“whose testimony would be limited to providing the foundation for
the admission of records[.]” MCR 2.401(I)(1)(a).
B. Sanctions for Failure to File Witness List
“The court may order that any witness not listed in accordance wit h
[MCR 2.401] will be prohibited from testifying at trial except upo n
good cause shown.” MCR 2.401(I)(2). “While it is within the trial
court’s authority to bar an expert witness or dismiss an action as a
sanction for the failure to timely file a witness list, the fact that suc h
action is discretionary rather than mandatory necessitates a
consideration of the circumstances of each case to determine if suc h
a drastic sanction is appropriate.” Dean v Tucker, 182 Mich App 27,
32 (1990). Just because a witness list was not timely filed does no t
justify the imposition of such a sanction. Id. at 32. See Section 5.1()
for additional discussion of the Dean case and a nonexhaustive lis t
of factors to consider when determining what is an appropriate
sanction.

Section 6.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
6.1 Early Scheduling Conference
“At any time after the commencement of the action, on its own initiativ e
or the request of a party, the court may direct that the attorneys for th e
parties, alone or with the parties, appear for a conference. The court shall
give reasonable notice of the scheduling of a conference. More than on e
1
conference may be held in an action.” MCR 2.401(A).
See Section 5.1(F) for information on ESI conferences and Section 5.1(G)
for information on final pretrial conferences.
A. Purposes
Setting an early scheduling conference may serve the followin g
collective purposes:
• To consider whether jurisdiction and venue are proper;
• To consider whether the case is frivolous;
• To decide whether an alternative dispute resolution
2
(ADR) process is appropriate and to discuss possible
methods of ADR;
• To consider the complexity of the case and to enter a
scheduling order;
• To consider issues associated with disclosure, discovery,
preservation, and claims of privilege of ES I
(electronically stored information), including the timin g
of disclosures under MCR 2.302(A) and the staging and
the modification of the extent of discovery;
• To identify and simplify the issues;
• To discuss estimated length of discovery and trial;
• To discuss amendments of pleadings;
• To discuss admissions of fact and documents;
• To discuss the pretrial order;
1The use of videoconferencing technology is presumed through the application of MCR 2.408(B)(2) and
MCR 2.408(C)(2) to early scheduling conferences under MCR 2.401(B). See Section 1.15 for more
information on videoconferencing. DS: HAVING TROUBLE GETTING CROSSREF TO WORK.
2See Section 6.4 regarding alternative dispute resolution.
Page 6-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 331 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.1
• To propose limitations on the number of expert
witnesses and discuss disclosure and discovery periods
for experts and expert reports;
• To discuss consolidation of actions, separation of issues,
and the order of trial when some issues will be tried b y
the jury and some issues will be tried by the court;
• To discuss the possibility of settlement;
• To discuss whether various alternative dispute
resolution (ADR) methods would be appropriate for th e
case and the mechanisms available to provide AD R
services;
• To identify witnesses actually testifying at trial;
• To discuss the estimated length of trial;
• To determine whether MCR 2.203(A) has been satisfied
(joinder of claims); and
• To discuss any “other matters that may aid in the
disposition of the action.” MCR 2.401(B)(1)(a)-(r).
Committee Tip:
It is also helpful to discuss things such a s
•
whether jurors may take notes, whether jurors
may ask questions, the exhibit marking process,
motions in limine (sometime before jury
selection), the voir dire process, and proposed
jury instructions.
B. Participants
Attorneys, either alone or with the parties, may be ordered to
participate in an early scheduling or pretrial conference. MCR
2.401(A); MCR 2.401(F) (not applicable to early scheduling
conferences). The order may specify that the attorneys who intend t o
try the case must be present. See MCR 2.401(E). The attorney must b e
prepared and have the authority to fully participate in the conference.
Id. The conference may be held in chambers or by conference call. See
MCR 2.402.
Where the court expects meaningful discussion of settlement, th e
court may require the presence of attorneys, parties, representative s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-3
=== Page 332 ===
Section 6.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
of lien holders, representatives of insurance carriers, or other persons.
MCR 2.401(E)-(F). The court cannot designate who will be a party’ s
representative. Kornak v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 211 Mich App 416, 422
(1995). But see MCR 2.401(F)(2), which provides that in a pretrial
conference, the court may require the availability of a specified
individual as long as the order authorizes the use of a substitute wh o
has the same information and authority. The conference may be held
in chambers or by conference call. See MCR 2.402. “The court’s orde r
may specify whether the availability is to be in person or b y
telephone.” MCR 2.401(F).
A party may be defaulted or a dismissal may be ordered for th e
failure of the party, or the party’s attorney or representative, to atten d
a scheduled conference, or for lacking the information and authorit y
necessary to effectively participate in all aspects of the conference.
MCR 2.401(G)(1). However, if manifest injustice would result from a n
order of default or dismissal, or the failure was not due to th e
culpable negligence of the party or the party’s attorney, the court ma y
excuse the failure and enter a just order. MCR 2.401(G)(2)(a)–(b). “The
court may condition the order on the payment by the offending part y
or attorney of reasonable expenses as provided in MCR 2.313(B)(2). ”
MCR 2.401(G).
A party cannot be defaulted based solely on a representative of th e
party’s insurance company refusing to make a settlement offer. Henr y
v Prusak, 229 Mich App 162, 170 (1998).
A party represented by counsel is not required to appear in person fo r
a civil proceeding unless he or she has been ordered by the court o r
subpoenaed to appear. Rocky Produce, Inc v Frontera, 181 Mich Ap p
516, 517-518 (1989) (the trial court erred in entering a defaul t
judgment against the defendant, who was represented by counsel, fo r
failing to appear at trial absent a subpoena or court order).
Committee Tip:
Settlement conferences are typically set 1-1 4
days before trial but may be set at any time.
They may last from 15 minutes to all day
depending on the case. For this reason, it is
important to determine the scope of a
settlement conference at a pretrial conference.
Page 6-4 Michigan Judicial Institute

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.1
C. Scheduling Orders
When creating a scheduling order, the court must take int o
consideration:
• Nature and complexity of the case;
• Number and location of the parties;
• Number and location of the witnesses;
• Extent of expected and necessary discovery; and
• Availability of reasonably certain trial dates. MCR
2.401(B)(2)(b).
Generally, the court should only enter a scheduling order after havin g
“meaningful consultation with all counsel of record.” MCR
2.401(B)(2)(d). However, if the court enters a scheduling order
without providing advance consultation, a party has 14 days to fil e
and serve a written request for an amendment of the schedulin g
order. MCR 2.401(B)(2)(d)(i). The court must reconsider its decisio n
and “either enter a new scheduling order or notify the parties i n
writing that the court declines to amend the order.” MCR
2.401(B)(2)(d)(ii). The reconsidered decision must be made within 14
days after receiving the request. Id.
If the court concludes that a scheduling order will “facilitate th e
progress of the case,” it must “establish times for events and adop t
other provisions the court deems appropriate, including
(i) the initiation or completion of an ADR process,
(ii) the amendment of pleadings, adding of parties, or
filing of motions,
(iii) what, if any, changes should be made in the timing,
form, or requirement for disclosures under MCR
2.203(A),
(iv) what, if any, changes should be made to th e
limitations on discovery imposed under these rules an d
whether other presumptive limitations should b e
established,
(v) the completion of discovery,
(vi) the exchange of witness lists under [MCR
2.401(H)(2)(h)], and
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-5
=== Page 334 ===
Section 6.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(vii) the scheduling of a pretrial conference, a settlemen t
conference, or trial.” MCR 2.401(B)(2)(a)(i)-(v).
While “trial courts may issue scheduling orders to establish times fo r
events including filing of motions” under MCR 2.401(B)(2)(a)(ii), “the
failure to file a timely brief in response to a dispositive motion is not,
by itself, grounds for dismissal as a sanction.” Cleveland v Hath, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up).
The scheduling order may also include provisions related to initial
disclosure, ESI, claims of privilege, and preserving discoverabl e
information. MCR 2.401(B)(2)(c).
D. Standard of Review
A dismissal under MCR 2.401(G) is reviewed for an abuse o f
discretion. Schell v Baker Furniture Co, 232 Mich App 470, 474 (1998).
The Court of Appeals “reviews for an abuse of discretion a trial
court’s decision to decline to entertain motions filed after the deadlin e
set forth in its scheduling order.” Kemerko Clawson, LLC v RxIV Inc, 26 9
Mich App 347, 349 (2005).
6.2 Offer of Judgment
MCR 2.405 sets forth procedures applicable to offers of judgment. “The
purpose of MCR 2.405 is to encourage settlement and to deter protracted
litigation.” Gudewicz v Matt’s Catering, Inc, 188 Mich App 639, 643 (1991).
Although the Court of Appeals did not decide whether MCR 2.405
applies to purely equitable actions, it did state that, “at the minimum,
[MCR 2.405] does apply to mixed law and equity actions in which th e
offer of judgment only offers monetary damages and the equitable claim s
are to be dismissed.” McManus v Toler, 289 Mich App 283, 290 (2010).
A. Procedure and Timing
A party may serve an offer of judgment for a sum certain on a n
adverse party until 28 days before trial. MCR 2.405(B). The party may
accept the offer, reject it, or submit a counteroffer (which constitutes a
rejection). See MCR 2.405(A)(2); MCR 2.405(C).
The adverse party may accept an offer or counteroffer by serving
written notice of acceptance on the other parties and filing it an d
proof of service with the court within 21 days of being served with th e
offer or counteroffer. MCR 2.405(C)(1); MCR 2.405(C)(3).
Page 6-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 335 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.2
If an offer or counteroffer is accepted, the court must “enter a
judgment according to the terms of the stipulation.” MCR 2.405(C)(1);
MCR 2.405(C)(3).
3
The adverse party may reject an offer or counteroffer by:
“(a) expressly reject[ing] it in writing, or
(b) . . . not accept[ing] it as provided by [MCR
2.405(C)(1)].” MCR 2.405(C)(2)(a)-(b); MCR 2.405(3).
Costs must be ordered if an offer or counteroffer is rejected and th e
offeror receives a more favorable decision. See MCR 2.405(D). See also
Section 6.2(B) for further discussion.
B. Costs Payable Upon Rejected Offer
“If an offer is rejected, costs are payable as follows:
(1) If the adjusted verdict is more favorable to the
offeror than the average offer, the offeree must pay t o
the offeror the offeror’s actual costs incurred in the
prosecution or defense of the action.
(2) If the adjusted verdict is more favorable to th e
offeree than the average offer, the offeror must pay t o
the offeree the offeree’s actual costs incurred in th e
prosecution or defense of the action. However, a n
offeree who has not made a counteroffer may no t
recover actual costs unless the offer was made less tha n
4
42 days before trial.” MCR 2.405(D)(1)-(2).
The court must determine the actual costs incurred. MCR 2.405(D)(3).
“A request for costs under [MCR 2.405(D)] must be filed and served
within 28 days after the entry of the judgment or entry of an orde r
denying a timely motion (i) for a new trial, (ii) to set aside th e
judgment, or (iii) for rehearing or reconsideration.” MCR 2.405(D)(6).
“A judgment adjudicating the rights and liabilities of the particula r
parties, so that there is no cause of action outstanding, starts the 28-
day period for requesting offer-of-judgment sanctions under MCR
2.405(D).” Kopf v Bolser, 286 Mich App 425, 433-434 (2009) (finding th e
defendant was not entitled to offer-of-judgment sanctions where h e
filed his motion more than 28 days after a judgment adjudicating th e
rights and liabilities of the parties was entered, even though th e
3 “A rejection does not preclude a later offer by either party.” MCR 2.405(C)(2).
4The other subsections of MCR 2.405(D) are discussed separately below.

precise amount of taxable costs and interest had not yet bee n
determined).
The payment of taxable costs and reasonable attorney fees is required,
except “[t]he court may, in the interest of justice, refuse to award a n
attorney fee[.]” MCR 2.405(D)(3). Other interest of justice exception s
may apply, such as cases involving an issue of public interest. Id.
Viewed in light of the purpose of MCR 2.405 to encourage settlemen t
and deter protracted litigation, the interest of justice exception “shoul d
not be applied absent unusual circumstances.” AFP Specialties, Inc v
Vereyken, 303 Mich App 497, 518-519 (2014) (quotation marks an d
citations omitted). Granting attorney fees under MCR 2.405(D)
“should be the rule rather than the exception” in order to avoid
expanding the interest of justice exception “to the point where it would
render the rule ineffective.” Andreson v Progressive Marathon Ins Co,
322 Mich App 76, 94 (2017) (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Whether the interests of justice exception applies must be decided o n
a case-by-case basis. Id.
Because they are “too common to fit within the ‘interest of justice ’
exception,” factors that should not be considered when determinin g
whether the exception applies include:
• the economic position of the parties,
• the nonfrivolousness of a party’s claim, or
• the reasonable refusal of an offer. Luidens v 63rd Dist Court,
219 Mich App 24, 34-35 (1996).
“[T]he exception may be applied when an offer is made for th e
purpose of gamesmanship and not a sincere effort at negotiation. ”
AFP Specialties, Inc, 303 Mich App at 519 (quotation marks and
citations omitted).
“[A] party may not recover appellate fees and costs as actual cost s
under MCR 2.405” because they “are not incurred as a result of a
party’s decision to reject an offer of judgment[.]” Lech v Huntmor e
Estates Condo Ass’n, 310 Mich App 258, 259, 263 (2015), vacated in par t
5
on other grounds 498 Mich 968 (2016).
MCR 2.405 does not apply to class action cases filed under MCR 3.501.

6.3 Original Action to Enter a Consent Judgment or
Consent Order
MCR 3.223 “governs practice and procedure for entering a consen t
judgment or consent order as an original action.” MCR 3.223(A).
A. Commencing an Action
To commence an action, the parties must “file a petition to submit t o
court jurisdiction and request for entry of a proposed consen t
judgment or proposed consent order on a form approved by the Stat e
Court Administrative Office [(SCAO)].” MCR 3.223(C)(1). Th e
petition must “be brought ‘In the Matter of’ the names of Party A an d
Party B and the subject matter of the proposed consent judgment o r
proposed consent order using the case type codes under MCR 8.117. ”
MCR 3.223(C)(1)(a).
The petition must also:
• contain the grounds for jurisdiction, the statutory
grounds to enter the judgment or order, and a request t o
enter the judgment or order;
• satisfy the requirements of MCR 2.113, MCR 3.206(A),
and MCR 3.206(B);
• be signed by both parties;
• be accompanied by the proposed judgment or order that
complies with MCR 3.211 and is signed by both parties;
• be accompanied by a verified statement if required b y
MCR 3.206(C), a judgment information form if required
by MCR 3.211(F), and domestic violence screening form s
(separately completed for each party) pursuant to MCL
691.1345. MCR 3.223(C)(1)(a).
A petition filed under MCR 3.223(C)(1)(a) “serves as a complaint and
answer unless a party files an objection under [MCR 3.223(C)(5)]. I t
also serves as an appearance of the attorney who signs the petition. ”
MCR 3.223(C)(2).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-9
=== Page 338 ===
Section 6.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Upon receipt of a petition filed under MCR 3.223(C)(1), and paymen t
of applicable filing fees, the court clerk must:
“(a) assign a case number and judge, and shall issue a
notice of the filing on a form approved by [SCAO] to b e
served by Party A as provided in MCR 2.103 and [MCR]
2.105. The court clerk shall not issue a summons under
MCR 2.102(A), and
(b) schedule a hearing date on the proposed consen t
judgment or consent order but shall not schedule th e
matter for any pretrial proceedings unless requested b y
the parties on filing of a motion. The hearing date ma y
not be scheduled sooner than 60 days after the date o f
the notice of filing. . . .” MCR 3.223(C)(3).
“The notice of the filing must be issued ‘In the name of the people o f
the State of Michigan,’ under the seal of the court that issued it.” MCR
3.223(C)(4). The notice “must be directed to both parties and include:
(a) the name and address of the court,
(b) the names of the parties,
(c) the case number and name of assigned judge,
(d) the names, addresses, and bar numbers of an y
attorneys representing the parties,
(e) the date on which the notice of filing was issued,
(f) the date on which the proposed consent judgment o r
order will be heard by the court,
(g) a statement that if either party objects to thi s
summary proceeding at any time before entry of th e
proposed consent judgment or consent order, the cas e
will be dismissed, and
(h) a statement that the hearing on the proposed consen t
judgment or consent order will be held under MCR
3.210 at the conclusion of any applicable statutory
waiting period.” MCR 3.223(C)(4).
After the filing of a proposed consent judgment or proposed consen t
order, “the parties may file stipulations and motions and the cour t
may enter temporary orders.” MCR 3.223(C)(6).
Divorce cases. The parties may include a request to waive the six-
month statutory waiting period under MCL 552.9f in the petition, and

nothing in MCR 3.223 precludes the court from granting the request.
MCR 3.223(C)(1)(b); MCR 3.223(C)(3)(b).
B. Entry of Final Consent Judgment or Consent Order
“The court shall conduct a hearing on the proposed consent judgmen t
or proposed consent order in accordance with MCR 3.210. Excep t
when a consent judgment is derived through MCR 3.222 [Unifor m
Collaborative Law Act process and agreements], both petitioner s
shall be present for this hearing. The final consent judgment or fina l
consent order shall be served in accordance with MCR 2.602(D). ”
MCR 3.223(D).
C. Dismissal
“A party may dismiss a matter commenced under this rule at any tim e
under MCR 2.504 or as provided under [MCR 3.223(C)(5)].” MCR
3.223(E).
The court must dismiss the case if either party objects to the summar y
proceeding prior to entry of the proposed consent judgment o r
proposed consent order. MCR 3.223(C)(5).
6.4 Alternative Dispute Resolution
“All civil cases are subject to alternative dispute resolution processe s
unless otherwise provided by statute or court rule.” MCR 2.410(A)(1).
Courts that use ADR pursuant to MCR 2.410 must develop an ADR pla n
by local administrative order and must meet the requirements of MCR
2.410(B). MCR 2.410(B)(1). “The chief judge shall exercise general
supervision over the implementation of [MCR 2.410] and shall review th e
operation of the court’s ADR plan at least annually to assure complianc e
with [MCR 2.410].” MCR 2.410(F).
“At any time, after consultation with the parties, the court may order tha t
a case be submitted to an appropriate ADR process.” MCR 2.410(C)(1).
Unless the rule under which the case was referred provides otherwise,
the order must provide for the selection and payment of the ADR
provider and set time limits for initiation and completion of the process.
MCR 2.410(C)(2). In addition, the court may order other provisions as i t
considers appropriate, and the order may require attendance at ADR
proceedings as provided in MCR 2.410(D). MCR 2.410(C)(2); MCR
2.410(3). A party may object to the court’s decision to refer the case t o
ADR by filing a motion within 14 days after the order referring the cas e
was entered. MCR 2.410(E). Attorneys, parties, and representatives o f
lienholders or insurance carriers can be required to attend or be available
at the time of the ADR proceedings and have adequate information and

authority “for responsible and effective participation in the conferenc e
for all purposes[.]” MCR 2.410(D). The court may allow the entity t o
appear by telephone. Id.
Failure to attend an ADR proceeding, as ordered, may result in a defaul t
or dismissal of the action. MCR 2.410(D)(3)(a). However, the court mus t
excuse a failure to attend and enter a just order other than a default or
dismissal upon a finding that manifest injustice would occur if a defaul t
or dismissal is ordered, or that “the failure to attend was not due to the
culpable negligence of the party or the party’s attorney.” MCR
2.410(D)(3)(b). “The court may condition the order on the payment by the
offending party or attorney of reasonable expenses as provided in MCR
2.313(B)(2).” MCR 2.410(D)(3).
“In a case in which a discovery plan has been filed with the court unde r
[6]
MCR 2.401(C), an included stipulation to use an ADR process othe r
[7]
than case evaluation must:
(a) identify the ADR process to be used;
(b) describe the timing of the ADR process in relation to other
discovery provisions; and
(c) state that the ADR process be completed no later than 60
days after the close of discovery.” MCR 2.403(A)(2).
“In a case in which no discovery plan has been filed with the court, a
stipulated order to use an ADR process other than case evaluation must:
(a) be submitted to the court within 120 days of the firs t
responsive pleading;
(b) identify the ADR process to be used and its timing i n
relationship to the deadlines for completion of disclosure and
discovery; and
(c) state that the ADR process be completed no later than 60
days after the close of discovery.” MCR 2.403(A)(3).
“Parties who participate in a stipulated ADR process approved by th e
court may not subsequently be ordered to participate in case evaluatio n
without their written consent.” MCR 2.403(A)(1).
Parties may also agree to a collaborative alternative dispute process. Se e

6.5 Case Evaluation
A. Scope and Applicability
“The general purpose of case evaluation under MCR 2.403 is t o
expedite and simplify the final settlement of cases to avoid a trial. ”
Vandercook v Auto-Owners Ins Co, 325 Mich App 195, 202 (2018).
Any civil action in which the relief sought is primarily mone y
damages or division of property may be submitted to case evaluation,
including actions filed in district court, unless the parties stipulate t o
8
an ADR process outlined in MCR 2.403(A)(2)-(3), in which case th e
parties cannot be subsequently ordered to participate in cas e
evaluation without their written consent. MCR 2.403(A)(1); MCR
2.403(A)(5).
“A court may exempt claims seeking equitable relief from cas e
evaluation for good cause shown on motion or by stipulation of th e
parties if the court finds that case evaluation of such claims would b e
inappropriate.” MCR 2.403(A)(4). However, when a trial court doe s
not exempt any aspect of plaintiff’s claim under MCR 2.403(A)(4),
neither party objects to case evaluation, and the case involves one
plaintiff against one defendant, the case evaluation panel has th e
entire case for consideration and determination. Vandercook, 325 Mic h
App at 204-205 (finding that plaintiff’s failure to address certai n
claims in his case evaluation summary did not serve to exempt thos e
claims from the panel’s consideration). Parties do not have th e
authority to exempt claims from case evaluation without cour t
approval. See CAM Constr v Lake Edgewood Condo Ass’n, 465 Mich 549,
557 (2002).
B. Submission of Cases
“The judge to whom an action is assigned or the chief judge ma y
select it for case evaluation by written order after the filing of th e
answer
(a) on written stipulation by the parties,
(b) on written motion by a party, or,
(c) if the parties have not submitted an ADR plan under
[MCR 2.403(A)].”MCR 2.403(B)(1).
8See Section 6.4 for more information on ADR and MCR 2.403(A)(2)-(3).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-13

Section 6.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
C. Objections to Case Evaluation
To object to case evaluation, a written motion and notice of hearin g
must be filed and served within 14 days after notice of the orde r
assigning the case to case evaluation. MCR 2.403(C)(1). “The motio n
must be set for hearing within 14 days after it is filed, unless the cour t
orders otherwise.” Id. “A timely motion must be heard before the cas e
is submitted to case evaluation.” MCR 2.403(C)(2).
D. Fees
Each party must pay a case evaluation fee. MCR 2.403(H)(1). “Only a
single fee is required of each party, even where there ar e
counterclaims, cross-claims, or third-party claims.” MCR 2.403(H)(2).
Similarly, “[i]f one claim is derivative of another (e.g., husband-wife,
parent-child) they must be treated as a single claim, with one fee to b e
paid[.]” MCR 2.403(H)(3). The court must waive a case evaluation fe e
imposed under MCR 2.403(H) if the person is entitled to a fee waiver
9
under MCR 2.002. MCR 2.403(H)(2). See Section 1.11 for additional
discussion of fee waivers.
Refundable fees. Fees paid pursuant to MCR 2.403(H) must b e
refunded to the parties if:
• the order submitting the matter to case evaluation is se t
aside by the court;
• the court adjourns the case evaluation hearing on its
own initiative; or
• with at least 14 days written notice to the ADR clerk, the
parties settle, dismiss, enter a judgment disposing of th e
action, or an order of adjournment is entered b y
stipulation or motion. MCR 2.403(H)(4).
Nonrefundable fees. Fees paid pursuant to MCR 2.403(H) must no t
be refunded if:
• the fees are applied to an adjourned hearing date; or
• absent good cause, a requested adjournment is made
and granted less than 14 days before the scheduled cas e
evaluation. MCR 2.403(H)(5).
9“Notwithstanding any other provision of [MCR 2.002], courts must enable a litigant who seeks a fee
waiver to do so by an entirely electronic process.” MCR 2.002(L).

=== Page 343 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.5
E. Submission of Summary and Supporting Documents
At least 14 days prior to the hearing, parties are required to serve a
case evaluation summary and supporting documents pursuant t o
MCR 2.107, and file proof of service and three copies of the summar y
and supporting documents with the ADR clerk. MCR 2.403(I)(1)(a)-
(b). “Each failure to timely file and serve the materials identified i n
[MCR 2.403(I)(1)] and each subsequent filing of supplemental
materials within 7 days of the hearing, subjects the offending attorney
or party to a $150 penalty to be paid in the manner specified in th e
case evaluation hearing. Filing and serving the materials identified i n
[MCR 2.403(I)(1)] within 24 hours of the hearing subjects th e
offending attorney or party to an additional $150 penalty.” MCR
2.403(I)(2).
10
F. Case Evaluation Decision
The panel’s case evaluation must be in writing and submitted to th e
ADR clerk within 7 days after the case evaluation hearing. MCR
2.403(K)(1). The evaluation must indicate if it is a nonunanimous
award. Id.The panel must provide a written copy of the evaluation t o
the attorney for each party if an evaluation is made immediatel y
following the hearing. Id. “If an evaluation is not made immediately
following the hearing, the evaluation must be served by the ADR
clerk on each party within 14 days after the hearing.” Id. Except a s
indicated in MCR 2.403(H)(3) (derivative claims), the panel’s case
evaluation “must include a separate award as to each plaintiff’s clai m
against each defendant and as to each cross-claim, counterclaim, o r
third-party claim that has been filed in the action.” MCR 2.403(K)(2).
For purposes of MCR 2.403(K)(2), “all such claims filed by any one
party against any other party shall be treated as a single claim.” Id. I n
addition, although the evaluation cannot include a separate award o n
any equitable claim, the panel may consider equitable claims whe n
determining the award amount. MCR 2.403(K)(3).
In certain tort cases, “if the panel unanimously finds that a party’ s
action or defense as to any other party is frivolous, the panel shall s o
indicate on the evaluation.” MCR 2.403(K)(4). If a party’s claim or
defense is found to be frivolous, that party may file a motion withi n
14 days seeking judicial review of the panel’s finding. See MCR
2.403(N)(2). For more information on a proceeding involving a
potentially frivolous claim, see Section 6.5(G).
In certain medical malpractice cases, the evaluation must specificall y
find whether there has been a breach of the applicable standard o f

on the hearing itself, see MCR 2.403(J).

care, or whether reasonable minds could differ on whether a breac h
occurred. MCR 2.403(K)(5). Although specific discussion of cas e
evaluation in the context of medical malpractice is outside the scop e
of this benchbook, see Section 9.11 for more information on medical
malpractice actions generally. In addition, see the Michigan Judicial
Institute’s Evidence Benchbook, Chapter 4, for information on exper t
testimony, including experts in medical malpractice cases.
G. Judicial Review of Panel Finding a Claim or Defense
Frivolous
”In a tort case to which MCL 600.4915(2) or MCL 600.4963(2) applies,
if the panel unanimously finds that a party’s action or defense as t o
any other party is frivolous, the panel shall so indicate on th e
evaluation.” MCR 2.403(K)(4). “Except as provided in [MCR
2.403(N)(2)], if a party’s claim or defense was found to be frivolou s
under [MCR 2.403(K)(4)], that party shall post a cash or surety bond,
pursuant to MCR 3.604, in the amount of $5,000 for each party agains t
whom the action or defense was determined to be frivolous.” MCR
2.403(N)(3). “The bond must be posted within 56 days after the case
evaluation hearing or at least 14 days before trial, whichever i s
earlier.” MCR 2.403(N)(3)(a). An insurance company that insures a
defendant against a claim may not act as the surety. MCR
2.403(N)(3)(b). The court must dismiss a claim found to be frivolou s
or enter a default against a defendant whose defense was declare d
frivolous if the party fails to post bond as required. MCR
2.403(N)(3)(c). “The action shall proceed to trial as to the remainin g
claims and parties, and as to the amount of damages against a
defendant in default.” Id.
A party whose claim or defense was unanimously declared frivolou s
“may request that the court review the panel’s finding by filing a
motion within 14 days after the ADR clerk sends notice of th e
rejection of the case evaluation award.” MCR 2.403(N)(2). Oral
arguments are permitted at the court’s discretion, but the motion ca n
only be supported by summaries and documents that wer e
considered by the case evaluation panel. MCR 2.403(N)(2)(a). “If th e
court agrees with the panel’s determination, the provisions of [MCR
2.403(N)(3)] apply, except that the bond must be filed within 28 day s
after the entry of the court’s order determining the action or defens e
to be frivolous.” MCR 2.402(N)(2)(c). A judge who hears a motion
under MCR 2.402(N) cannot preside at a nonjury trial of the action.
MCR 2.402(N)(2)(d).
MCR 2.403(N) does not apply to actions that sound in contract.
Wilcoxon v Wayne Co Neighborhood Legal Servs, 252 Mich App 549, 55 2
(2002).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.5
H. Acceptance or Rejection of Evaluation
11
Within 28 days of being served with the evaluation, each party must
file with the ADR clerk a written acceptance or rejection of th e
evaluation. MCR 2.403(L)(1). Failure to do so constitutes a rejection.
Id. “Even if there are separate awards on multiple claims, the party
must either accept or reject the evaluation in its entirety as to a
particular opposing party.” Id.
When the evaluation involves multiple parties, specific rules apply:
“(a) Each party has the option of accepting all of th e
awards covering the claims by or against that party or o f
accepting some and rejecting others. However, as to an y
particular opposing party, the party must either accep t
or reject the evaluation in its entirety.
(b) A party who accepts all of the awards ma y
specifically indicate that he or she intends th e
acceptance to be effective only if
(i) all opposing parties accept, and/or
(ii) the opposing parties accept as to specified
coparties.”
If such a limitation is not included in the acceptance, a n
accepting party is deemed to have agreed to entry o f
judgment, or dismissal as provided in [MCR
2.403(M)(1)], as to that party and those of the opposing
parties who accept, with the action to continue betwee n
the accepting party and those opposing parties wh o
reject.” MCR 2.403(L)(3).
“The grammar of [MCR 2.403(L)(3)(a)-(b)] indicates that the word
‘some’ in the phrase ‘accepting some and rejecting others’ refers to th e
awards, not the parties.” Mercantile Bank Mtg Co, LLC v NGPCP/BRY S
Ctr, LLC, 305 Mich App 215, 225 (2014) (finding that although the cas e
evaluation panel failed to follow the court rules when it issued a
single award for multiple parties, the plaintiff’s partial acceptance/
partial rejection of the single award was an improper response tha t
constituted a rejection of the entire evaluation).
A party’s acceptance or rejection cannot be disclosed until th e
expiration of the 28-day period. MCR 2.403(L)(2). Once the 28 day s
has passed, the ADR clerk must send a notice indicating each party’ s
response to the evaluation. Id.
11 For cases filed in district court this time period may be shortened. See MCR 2.403(A)(1).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-17
=== Page 346 ===
Section 6.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
1. Issues Regarding Rejection
If the evaluation is rejected, “the action proceeds to trial in the
12
normal fashion.” MCR 2.403(N)(1). Before trial, the ADR clerk
will place a copy of the case evaluation in a sealed envelope and
file it with the clerk of the court. MCR 2.403(N)(4). In a bench
trial, the envelope should not be opened, and the parties should
not reveal the case evaluation amount until after the court ha s
rendered its judgment. Id. Declaring a mistrial and reassigning
the case to another judge is the only appropriate sanctio n
“where a party, in clear violation of MCR 2.403(N)(4), makes a
blatant effort to influence the court before it renders judgmen t
and there is no suggestion that the revelation was done as a
means to forum shop.” Bennett v Med Evaluation Specialists, 244
Mich App 227, 231-233 (2000). See also MCR 2.403(N)(2)(d)
(“[t]he judge who hears a motion under [MCR 2.403(N)] may no t
preside at a nonjury trial of the action”). However, “a new trial i s
[not] required in every case in which a violation of MCR
2.403(N)(4) occurs.” Cranbrook Prof Bldg, LLC v Pourcho, 256 Mic h
App 140, 144 (2003) (new trial was not required where “case
evaluation was revealed to the court before commencement of
trial under the presumption that the case would be tried by a
jury” and plaintiffs did not seek a new trial under MCR
2.403(N)(4) until an adverse judgment was entered). “[T]h e
appropriate sanction depends on the particular facts of the case.”
Cranbrook, 256 Mich App at 144.
2. Issues Regarding Acceptance
“If all parties accept the panel’s evaluation, the case is over.”
CAM Constr v Lake Edgewood Condo Ass’n, 465 Mich 549, 55 7
(2002). Where there is acceptance by all parties, the trial cour t
should enter the judgment “in accordance with the evaluation,
unless the amount of the award is paid within 28 days after
notification of the acceptances, in which case the court shall
dismiss the action with prejudice.” MCR 2.403(M)(1). “The
judgment or dismissal shall be deemed to dispose of all claims i n
the action and includes all fees, costs, and interest to the date it i s
entered, except for cases involving rights to personal protectio n
[13]
insurance benefits under MCL 500.3101 et seq., for whic h
judgment or dismissal shall not be deemed to dispose of claim s
that have not accrued as of the date of the case evaluatio n
hearing.” MCR 2.403(M)(1). See also Magdich & Assoc, PC v Nov i
Dev Assoc LLC, 305 Mich App 272, 274-275 (2014), where th e
parties accepted a case evaluation award without qualificatio n
12 See Chapter 7 for discussion of civil trials.
Page 6-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 347 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.6
and the plaintiff paid the award to the defendant before the trial
court granted defendant’s motion to amend its counter-
complaint. The plaintiff moved for entry of an order of dismissal
with prejudice under MCR 2.403(M), alleging that the case wa s
resolved with regard to all claims, which the trial court denied.
Magdich, 305 Mich App at 275. The Michigan Court of Appeal s
reversed, holding that “both parties accepted the case evaluatio n
award without qualification, and therefore, the case is over.” Id.
at 281 (noting that the court rule does not allow a party to make
a showing that less than all issues were submitted to case
evaluation).
“If only a part of an action has been submitted to case evaluatio n
pursuant to [MCR 2.403(A)(4)] and all of the parties accept the
panel’s evaluation, the court shall enter an order disposing of
only those claims.” MCR 2.403(M)(2).
In cases involving multiple parties, the judgment or dismissal
referenced in MCR 2.403(M)(1) must “be entered as to those
opposing parties who have accepted the portions of the
evaluation that apply to them.” MCR 2.403(M)(3).
I. Motion to Set Aside Case Evaluation
Although a case is completely settled once both parties accept a cas e
evaluation award, a party is not precluded from filing a motion to se t
aside its acceptance. Goch Props, LLC v C Van Boxell Transp, Inc, 477
Mich 871 (2006). A trial court has discretion to set aside an acceptanc e
of the award before or after entry of a judgment on the award, bu t
should set aside after entry of a judgment “only if failure to do s o
would result in substantial prejudice.” Reno v Gale, 165 Mich App 86,
92-93 (1987).
6.6 Mediation
A. Generally
Mediation is the process “in which a neutral third party facilitate s
communication between parties, assists in identifying issues, and
helps explore solutions to promote a mutually acceptable settlement.
13 MCL 500.3101 et seq. governs no-fault cases. In “no-fault cases involving the right to PIP benefits, th e
trial court’s judgment may not dispose of claims that have not accrued as of the date of the case evaluatio n
hearing.” Vandercook v Auto-Owners Ins Co, 325 Mich App 195, 205 (2018). However, any claims that hav e
accrued “at the time of the case evaluation are, as a matter of law, disposed of pursuant to MC R
2.403(M)(1).” Vandercook, 325 Mich App at 205 (any wage loss that had accrued prior to the date of th e
case evaluation hearing was deemed resolved despite plaintiff’s refusal to address accrued wage loss in hi s
case evaluation summary, or the notation inserted in his acceptance form).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-19
=== Page 348 ===
Section 6.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
A mediator has no authoritative decision-making power.” MCR
2.411(A)(2).
1. Selection of Mediator
A mediator may be selected by the parties or by the court using
an established selection process. See MCR 2.411(B)(1); MCR
2.411(B)(3). If the court selects the mediator, the individual mus t
satisfy the minimum qualifications set forth in MCR 2.411(F).
However, a mediator selected by agreement of the parties need
not meet these minimum qualifications. MCR 2.411(B)(1).
If the mediation order does not specify a mediator, the order
must set a deadline by which the parties are to agree upon a
mediator. MCR 2.411(B)(2). If the parties select a mediator, the
court must appoint that mediator unless he or she is unable t o
serve during the scheduled time frame. MCR 2.411(B)(1). If the
parties do not agree on a mediator, one will be selected by the
court from the approved list of mediators as set forth in MCR
2.411(B)(3). MCR 2.411(B)(2).
Generally, the court must not appoint, recommend, direct, o r
otherwise influence the selection of a mediator other than a s
provided by MCR 2.411. MCR 2.411(B)(4). However, “[t]he cour t
may recommend or advise parties on the selection of a mediator
only upon request of all parties by stipulation in writing or
orally on the record.” Id.
Mediators are subject to the same disqualification rules as a
judge. MCR 2.411(B)(5).
2. Scheduling and Conduct of Mediation
“The order referring the case for mediation shall specify the time
within which the mediation is to be completed.” MCR
2.411(C)(1). The court’s ADR clerk must send a copy of the orde r
to each party and the selected mediator. Id. Multiple mediatio n
sessions can be held if it appears that the process is moving
toward settlement. MCR 2.411(C)(2). Within 7 days of
completing mediation, the mediator must notify the court only
of the following information: (1) the date the process wa s
completed; (2) who participated in the process; (3) whether a
settlement was reached; and (4) whether additional ADR
proceedings have been contemplated. MCR 2.411(C)(3). If
settlement is reached, the parties must prepare and submit the
appropriate documents to the court within 21 days. MCR
2.411(C)(4).
Page 6-20 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 349 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.6
3. Confidentiality
“Mediation communications are confidential. They are no t
subject to discovery, are not admissible in a proceeding, and may
not be disclosed to anyone other than mediation participants
except as provided in [MCR 2.412(D)].” MCR 2.412(C).
“Evidence or information that is otherwise admissible or subjec t
to discovery does not become inadmissible or protected fro m
discovery solely by reason of its disclosure or use in a
mediation.” MCR 2.412(E)(3).
“The term ‘mediation communications’ is defined expansively t o
include statements that ‘occur during the mediation process’ a s
well as statements that ‘are made for purposes of . . . preparing
for . . . a mediation.’ MCR 2.412(B)(2).” Tyler v Findling, 508 Mic h
364, 371 (2021) (alterations in original). There is no requirement
that “a mediator . . . meet with the parties and attorneys before
the definition of ‘mediation communications’ under MCR
2.412(B)(2) and the mediation confidentiality provision set fort h
in MCR 2.412(C) both attach.” Tyler, 508 Mich at 371. “Th e
confidentiality protections cover ‘[m]ediation communications,’
MCR 2.412(C), which are not limited to communications mad e
by a ‘mediation party’ but extend to, among other things, any
statement ‘made for purposes of . . . participating in . . . a
mediation.’ MCR 2.412(B)(2). This clearly encompasse s
statements made by a ‘mediation participant.’” Tyler, 508 Mich a t
372 (alterations in original). “[T]here is no requirement in MCR
2.412 that a ‘mediation communication’ be uttered by an y
particular party or participant. Rather, the rule simply explain s
to whom confidential mediation communications can be disclosed.
All mediation communications made by participants are
afforded confidentiality protections.” Tyler, 508 Mich at 371-372
(concluding that a conversation between attorneys that “took
place within the mediator’s designated ‘plaintiff’s room’ while
parties to the mediation were waiting for the mediation sessio n
to start . . . [was] part of the ‘mediation process’”).
4. Fees
Unless the parties agree, or the court orders otherwise, the cost s
of mediation must be divided between the parties on a pro-rata
basis. MCR 2.411(D)(2). The mediator’s fee must be paid no late r
than 42 days after mediation is concluded or a dismissal or
judgment is entered, whichever occurs first. Id. The court ma y
modify the payment deadline if the mediator consents. MCR
2.411(D)(3). An order to enforce payment of the fee as a cost o f
the action may be entered by the court. MCR 2.411(D)(4). If a
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-21
=== Page 350 ===
Section 6.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
party objects to the total fee, a hearing may be held by the cour t
to determine the reasonableness of the fee. MCR 2.411(D)(5).
B. Domestic Relations Mediation
“All domestic relations cases . . . and actions for divorce and separat e
maintenance that involve the distribution of property are subject t o
mediation under [MCR 3.216], unless otherwise provided by statute
or court rule.” MCR 3.216(A)(1). Domestic relations mediation i s
nonbinding, but if the parties and mediator agree, “the mediator ma y
provide a written recommendation for settlement of any issues tha t
remain unresolved at the conclusion of a mediation proceeding. ”
MCR 3.216(A)(2).
C. Child Protection Mediation
Child protection mediation is governed by MCR 3.970. See the
Michigan Judicial Institute’s Child Protective Proceedings Benchbook,
Chapter 7, for additional information on child protection mediation.
D. Mediation of Discovery Disputes
If a discovery dispute arises, the dispute may be mediated upo n
stipulation of the parties or order of the court. MCR 2.411(H). See
Section 5.1(H) for information on mediation of discovery disputes.
6.7 The Uniform Collaborative Law Act
The Uniform Collaborative Law Act, MCL 691.1331 et seq., “allow[s ]
parties to agree to a collaborative alternative dispute resolution proces s
as an alternative to litigation [in family or domestic relations cases]; and
to provide remedies.” See MCL 691.1333—MCL 691.1352 and MCR
3.222–MCR 3.223 for a complete discussion of collaborative alternativ e
dispute resolution. See also Section 6.3 for additional information on
original actions to enter a consent judgment or consent order.
6.8 Settlements
“A settlement agreement is a binding contract.” Dabish v Gayar, 343 Mich
App 285, 289 (2022) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “To settle a
lawsuit, there must be an offer and acceptance.” Id. at 289-290 (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Unless an acceptance is unambiguous an d
in strict conformance with the offer, no contract is formed.” Id. at 290
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Further, a contract require s
mutual assent or a meeting of the minds on all the essential terms.” Id. a t
290 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “An enforceable settlemen t
Page 6-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 351 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.8
depends on an offer and an acceptance that is unambiguous and in strict
conformance with the offer.” Id. at 291 (cleaned up).
A settlement agreement is a binding contract; therefore the interpretatio n
of a provision of a settlement agreement is a question of law, which i s
reviewed de novo. In re Conley Trust, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024).
“[The] goal in interpreting a contract is always to ascertai n
and give effect to the intent of the parties as reflected in the
plain language of the contract . . . The words of a contract ar e
interpreted according to their plain and ordinary meaning,
and this Court gives effect to every word, phrase, and clause
while avoiding interpretations that would render any part of
the document surplusage or nugatory. An unambiguou s
contract term must be enforced as written unless contrary t o
public policy. A contract is ambiguous if it is capable of
irreconcilably conflicting interpretations. If a contract i s
ambiguous, the proper interpretation presents a questio n
that must be decided by the fact-finder.” Id. at ___ (holdin g
that two provisions of the settlement agreement were
“complementary, rather than ambiguous”) (quotation mark s
and citations omitted).
A. Must Be in Writing or on the Record
“An agreement or consent between the parties or their attorney s
respecting the proceedings in an action is not binding unless made i n
open court, or unless evidence of the agreement is in writing,
subscribed by the party against whom the agreement is offered or b y
that party’s attorney.” MCR 2.507(G). This is essentially a statute o f
frauds governing legal proceedings. Kloian v Domino’s Pizza, LLC, 273
Mich App 449, 456 (2006).
“An agreement to settle a pending lawsuit is a contract and is to b e
governed by the legal principles applicable to the construction and
interpretation of contracts.” Walbridge Aldinger Co v Walcon Corp, 207
Mich App 566, 571 (1994). However, “[a] settlement agreement will
not be enforced even if it fulfills the requirements of contrac t
principles where the agreement does not additionally satisfy th e
14
requirements of [MCR 2.507(G)].” Columbia Assoc, LP v Dep’t o f
Treasury, 250 Mich App 656, 668-669 (2002).
Notes regarding possible settlement terms in the activity log of a n
insurance adjuster are “distinguishable from both an attorney-signe d
letter and a party-signed proposal,” and “does not rise to a level
14 Formerly MCR 2.507(H).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-23
=== Page 352 ===
Section 6.8 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
15
sufficient to satisfy the writing requirement of [MCR 2.507(G)].”
Mich Mut Ins Co v Indiana Ins Co, 247 Mich App 480, 486 (2001).
An exchange of e-mails may satisfy the requirement that th e
settlement be in writing as long as it is also subscribed. Kloian, 273
Mich App at 459. Subscription as contemplated by the court rule
means “to append, as one’s signature, at the bottom of a document or the
like; sign.” Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, an
“e-mail containing the terms of the settlement offer was subscribed b y
plaintiff’s attorney because he typed, or appended, his name at th e
end of the e-mail message” as did the defendant’s attorney’s reply e-
mail, whereas a subsequent modification by e-mail did not compl y
with the subscription requirement because the plaintiff’s attorney’ s
name was at the top of the e-mail. Id. at 459-460.
Where the “parties’ attorneys exchanged a host of e-mails in an effor t
to settle the matter, but the two key documents—the ‘Settlemen t
Agreement and Release’ and the ‘Membership Interest Purchas e
Agreement’—were never signed by [plaintiff],” the purporte d
settlement agreement was not enforceable pursuant to MCR 2.507(G).
Dabish v Gayar, 343 Mich App 285, 290-291 (2022) (noting the
“purported settlement in this case was not ‘made in open court,’” and
thus, could “only be enforced if it was ‘in writing, subscribed by th e
party against whom the agreement is offered or by that party’ s
attorney’”). Further, “there [was] nothing in the e-mai l
correspondence demonstrating that [plaintiff] ever accepted
defendants’ offer.” Id. at 290, 291.
Where the parties have agreed to settlement terms on the record bu t
cannot agree on the written terms, it may be appropriate for the trial
court to enforce the terms as stated on the record. Mikonczyk v Detroi t
Newspapers, Inc, 238 Mich App 347, 348-349 (1999).
B. Attorney’s Authority and Duty
Authority. An attorney is presumed to have authority to act on his o r
her client’s behalf. Jackson v Wayne Circuit Judge, 341 Mich 55, 5 9
(1954). However, an attorney must have specific authority from th e
client to settle a case. See Nelson v Consumers Power Co, 198 Mich Ap p
82, 85 (1993).
An attorney cannot prevent a client from settling a case. Simon v Ross,
296 Mich 200, 203 (1941). However, the attorney may assert a n
attorney’s lien for services rendered if a client decides to settle. George
16
v Sandor M Gelman, PC, 201 Mich App 474, 476-477 (1993).
15Formerly MCR 2.507(H).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.8
Duty. “It is the lawyer’s professional duty to ensure that his client is
fully advised and aware of all the ramifications of . . . a settlement. ”
Clark v Al-Amin, 309 Mich App 387, 400 (2015). “This professional
obligation is the core duty of the [party’s] lawyer—not the opposin g
party or its counsel. If the [party’s] lawyer fails to fulfill thi s
obligation—and does not ensure that he and his client consider all
possible claims before signing a settlement agreement—the lawye r
cannot shift this responsibility to the opposing party or opposin g
counsel.” Id. (holding that “[u]nder Michigan law, neither [an insurer]
nor its counsel ha[s] any duty to inform [an injured party] of possibl e
claims [he or] she [may] have . . . regarding [a PIP benefit], or t o
advise [him or] her to include those claims in [a] settlement”).
C. Court Approval
Committee Tips:
Always have parties confirm the details of
•
their settlement on the record.
Review attorney fees and expenses if required.
•
Approve attorney fees and expenses if
appropriate.
Court approval is required for settlements of class actions and
settlements for minors and incompetent persons. MCR 3.501(E); MCR
17
2.420(B). Court approval may be requested by the personal
18
representative for wrongful death settlements. MCL 600.2922(5).
Note: Authority to approve or reject a proposed
settlement involving a minor remains with the judge t o
whom the case was assigned when the action on behal f
of the minor was commenced, even when a party to th e
settlement has been dismissed from the case. Peterson v
Auto-Owners Ins Co, 274 Mich App 407, 415 (2007 )
(“[a]lthough [the minor defendant] was never served,
resulting in his dismissal, the action against him ha d
16“[A]n attorney’s charging lien for fees may not be imposed upon the real estate of a client . . . unless (1)
the parties have an express agreement providing for a lien, (2) the attorney obtains a judgment for the fee s
and follows the proper procedure for enforcing a judgment, or (3) special equitable circumstances exist t o
warrant imposition of a lien.” George, 201 Mich App at 478.

been commenced,” requiring the assigned judge t o
approve or reject the proposed settlement pursuant t o
MCR 2.420).
Taxable costs are deemed included in the settlement unless otherwis e
specified. MCR 2.625(H).
19
D. Conditional Dismissal
“The court may enter a consent order for conditional dismissal unde r
the following conditions:
(1) A consent order for conditional dismissal shall b e
signed and approved by all parties and shall clearl y
state the terms for reinstatement of the case and entry o f
judgment.
(2) If the breaching party defaults on the terms of th e
settlement agreement as provided for in the conditional
dismissal order, the non-defaulting party may see k
entry of an order for reinstatement of the case and entr y
of judgment.
(a) To obtain an order for reinstatement of the case
and entry of judgment, the non-defaulting party
shall file with the court an affidavit stating that the
breaching party defaulted on the terms of the
settlement agreement.
(b) The non-defaulting party shall serve a copy of
an affidavit of non-compliance on the breaching
party at its current address listed in the cour t
records and file proof of service with the court.
(c) If the order for conditional dismissal states tha t
judgment may be entered without notice or further
process, the court shall enter the proposed
judgment upon determining the conditions for
entry of judgment in the conditional dismissal
order are satisfied.
(d) If the order for conditional dismissal does no t
provide for immediate entry of judgment, the
affidavit shall be accompanied by a notice to the
breaching party that an order for reinstatemen t
and for entry of judgment is being submitted to the
court for entry if no written objections to it s

accuracy or completeness are filed with the cour t
clerk within 14 days after service of the notice.
Unless an objection is filed within 14 days after
service of the notice, an order for reinstatement of
the case and entry of judgment shall be signed by
the court and entered.
(i) An objection must be verified and state
with specificity the reasons that an order fo r
reinstatement of the case and entry o f
judgment should not enter.
(ii) If an objection is filed, the court shall set a
hearing and serve notice of that hearing to al l
parties.
(iii) This 14-day notice provision may be
waived in cases filed pursuant to MCR 4.201
if such waiver is acknowledged in writing.
(3) For the purposes of any statute of limitation, a n
action conditionally dismissed under this rule i s
deemed to have been initiated on the date the origina l
complaint was properly filed.
(4) All parties to a conditional dismissal bear th e
affirmative duty to inform the court with jurisdictio n
over that case of any change of address until the term s
of the settlement agreement have been satisfied.” MCR
2.602(C).
E. Wrongful Death Settlements
20
MCL 600.2922 governs wrongful death settlements. The personal
representative may request court approval of a settlement involving a
claim of damages in a wrongful death action. MCL 600.2922(5). I n
wrongful death cases, it must be determined whether there wa s
conscious pain and suffering, a claim that is an asset of the probat e
estate, when the court is determining how the proceeds of a
settlement will be distributed. MCL 600.2922(6)(d).
Committee Tip:
The judge may wish to determine whether there
is a probate estate and/or creditors before
20 See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s checklist on wrongful death settlements.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-27
=== Page 356 ===
Section 6.8 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
deciding whether there was pain and suffering.
MCR 8.121 addresses permissible attorney
contingency fee agreements in wrongful death
cases.
F. Settlements for Minors and Legally Incapacitated
Individuals
MCR 2.420 governs settlements for minors and legally incapacitated
21
individuals. A hearing must be conducted. MCR 2.420(B)(1); Bowden
v Hutzel Hosp, 252 Mich App 566, 574-575 (2002). If a conflict of
interest exists for the next friend, guardian, or conservator, the cour t
must appoint a lawyer guardian ad litem for the party. MCR
2.420(B)(2).
If a guardian or conservator has been appointed, he or she must b e
appointed before the settlement is approved, and the judgment mus t
specify that the money is to be paid to that person. MCR 2.420(B)(3).
See also Bierlein v Schneider, 478 Mich 893 (2007). In addition, the trial
court may not enter a judgment or dismissal until it receives writte n
verification from the probate court “that it has passed on th e
sufficiency of the bond and the bond, if any, has been filed with th e
probate court.” MCR 2.420(B)(3).
If a settlement for a minor involves an immediate payment to th e
minor that exceeds $5,000, or involves installment payments whic h
exceed more than $5,000 during any single year of minority, th e
probate court must appoint a conservator prior to entry of th e
judgment or dismissal. MCR 2.420(B)(4). “The court shall not enter
the judgment or dismissal until it receives written verification . . . tha t
the probate court has passed on the sufficiency of the bond of th e
22
conservator.” MCR 2.420(B)(4)(a).
“If a settlement or judgment provides for the creation of a trust for th e
minor or legally incapacitated individual, the circuit court shal l
determine the amount to be paid to the trust, but the trust shall not b e
funded without prior approval of the trust by the probate cour t
pursuant to notice to all interested persons and a hearing.” MCR
2.420(B)(5).
21 See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s checklist on settlements for minors and legally incapacitated
individuals.
22“If the settlement or judgment does not require payments of more than $5,000 to the minor in any single
year, the money may be paid in accordance with the provisions of MCL 700.5102.” MCR 2.420(B)(4)(b).
Page 6-28 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 357 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 6.8
G. Setting Aside Settlements
A settlement agreement is a contract and is “governed by the legal
principles applicable to the construction and interpretation o f
contracts.” Walbridge Aldinger Co v Walcon Corp, 207 Mich App 566,
571 (1994). “As a general rule, settlement agreements are final and
cannot be modified . . . because settlements are favored by the law,
and therefore will not be set aside, except for fraud, mutual mistake,
or duress.” Clark v Al-Amin, 309 Mich App 387, 395 (2015) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “A mutual mistake is an erroneou s
belief, which is shared and relied on by both parties, about a materia l
fact that affects the substance of the transaction.” Id. (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). Where the plaintiff agreed to “a settlement tha t
explicitly encompassed all PIP benefits incurred as of that date,” th e
plaintiff could not “void this universal, binding settlement b y
asserting that she and her lawyer were unaware of a . . . [PIP] benefi t
she had incurred several months before the settlement”; the plaintiff’ s
“unilateral lack of knowledge of the [additional medical] bill” was no t
a mutual mistake where “[the] plaintiff explicitly allege[d] that [th e
defendant] had knowledge of [the] charge . . . when it made th e
settlement agreement.” Id. at 388, 398-400.
“[S]ettlement agreements are binding until rescinded for cause. . . .
[T]ender of consideration received is a condition precedent to the
right to repudiate a contract of settlement.” Stefanac v Cranbrook E d
Comm (After Remand), 435 Mich 155, 163 (1990). Additionally, a part y
“must tender the recited consideration before there is a right t o
repudiate [a] release.” Id. at 165. “The only recognized exceptions in
Michigan are a waiver of the plaintiff’s duty by the defendant and
fraud in the execution.” Id. “A valid tender of performance o f
agreement to pay money requires an actual offer to pay and an abilit y
at the time of offer to pay the amount due. . . . Furthermore, the tende r
must be without stipulation or condition.” Swain v Kayko, 44 Mich
App 496, 501 (1973) (internal citation omitted).
H. Disclosure of Settlement
“When there is no genuine dispute regarding either the existence of a
release or a settlement between plaintiff and a codefendant or th e
amount to be deducted, the jury shall not be informed of the existenc e
of a settlement or the amount paid, unless the parties stipulat e
23
otherwise.” Brewer v Payless Stations, Inc, 412 Mich 673, 679 (1982).
“Following the jury verdict, upon motion of the defendant, the cour t
23See also the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Evidence Benchbook, Chapter 2, regarding the admissibility of
settlements and settlement negotiations.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 6-29
=== Page 358 ===
Section 6.8 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
shall make the necessary calculation and find the amount by whic h
the jury verdict will be reduced.” Id.
The trial court has discretion whether to disclose to the jury th e
existence of “high-low” settlements between the plaintiff and som e
defendants who remain in the case. Hashem v Les Stanford Oldsmobile,
Inc, 266 Mich App 61, 85-86 (2005). “[T]he interest of fairness served
by disclosure of the true alignment of the parties to the jury must b e
weighed against the countervailing interests in encouragin g
settlements and avoiding prejudice to the parties.” Id. at 86. “[T]h e
trial court has both the duty and the discretion to fashion procedure s
that ensure fairness to all the litigants in these situations.” Id.
I. Standard of Review
The trial court’s decision whether to permit a party to disavow a
settlement is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Groulx v Carlson, 176
Mich App 484, 493 (1989).
When reviewing the trial court’s decision involving the distribution o f
wrongful death proceeds, findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.
Hoogewerf v Kovach, 185 Mich App 577, 579 (1990). The court’ s
distribution of the proceeds based on its findings is reviewed for a n
abuse of discretion. Id.

Part I: Trial in General
7.1 Is Disqualification an Issue?
“Disqualification of a judge is warranted for reasons that include, but ar e
not limited to, the following:
(a) The judge is biased or prejudiced for or against a party or
attorney.
(b) The judge, based on objective and reasonable perceptions,
has either
(i) a serious risk of actual bias impacting the du e
process rights of a party as enunciated in Caperton v
Massey, 556 US 868 [(2009)], or
(ii) has failed to adhere to the appearance of impropriety
standard set forth in Canon 2 of the Michigan Code o f
Judicial Conduct.
(c) The judge has personal knowledge of disputed
evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.
(d) The judge has been consulted or employed as an attorney
in the matter in controversy.
(e) The judge was a partner of a party, attorney for a party, or
a member of a law firm representing a party within the
preceding two years.
(f) The judge knows that he or she, individually or as a
fiduciary, or the judge’s spouse, parent or child wherever
residing, or any other member of the judge’s family residing
in the judge’s household, has more than a de minimi s
economic interest in the subject matter in controversy tha t
could be substantially impacted by the proceeding.
Page 7-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 361 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.2
(g) The judge or the judge’s spouse, or a person within the
third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of
such a person:
(i) is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or
trustee of a party;
(ii) is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;
(iii) is known by the judge to have a more than de
minimis interest that could be substantially affected b y
the proceeding; or
(iv) is to the judge’s knowledge likely to be a material
witness in the proceeding.” MCR 2.003(C)(1).
A judge is not automatically disqualified when “the judge’s former la w
clerk is an attorney of record for a party in an action that is before th e
judge or is associated with a law firm representing a party in an actio n
that is before the judge.” MCR 2.003(C)(2)(a).
“Parties to the proceeding may waive disqualification even where i t
appears that there may be grounds for disqualification of the judge. Suc h
waiver may occur whether the grounds for disqualification were raised
by a party or by the judge, so long as the judge is willing to participate.
Any agreement to waive the disqualification must be made by all partie s
to the litigation and shall be in writing or placed on the record.” MCR
2.003(E).
“In reviewing a motion to disqualify a judge, [the Michigan Court o f
Appeals] reviews the trial court’s findings of fact for an abuse o f
discretion, and reviews the court’s application of those facts to th e
relevant law de novo.” In re Contempt of Henry, 282 Mich App 656, 679
(2009).
For more information on judicial disqualification, including examples o f
situations involving disqualification, see the Michigan Judicial Institute’ s
book, Judicial Disqualification in Michigan. See also the Michigan Judicial
Institute’s checklist and flowchart on judicial disqualification.
7.2 Pretrial Motions
The trial court is not required to explain its reasoning and state it s
findings of fact on pretrial motions, unless such findings are required b y
a particular rule. MCR 2.517(A)(4). See, e.g., MCR 2.504(B). However,
doing so is helpful for appellate review. People v Shields, 200 Mich App
554, 558 (1993). “When an appellate court orders a new trial, that includes
all phases of trial, including all pretrial matters such as motions fo r

summary disposition.” Law Offices of Jeffrey Sherbow, PC v Fieger & Fieger ,

7.3 Separate or Joint Trial
The trial court has discretion to consolidate or sever trials. MCR 2.505.
See Section 4.6 for additional information.

7.4 Oaths or Affirmations of Witnesses and Interpreters
This section does not discuss juror oaths. For information on that topic,
see Section 7.20(D) and Section 7.20(J).
“The word ‘oath’ shall be construed to include the word ‘affirmation’ i n
all cases where by law an affirmation may be substituted for an oath; and
in like cases the word ‘sworn’ shall be construed to include the word
‘affirmed.’” MCL 8.3k.
A. Oath for Witness
Together, MCL 600.1432, MCL 600.1434, and MRE 603 govern the oath
or affirmation of a testifying witness. Although the statutes set fort h
“[t]he typical manner for administering oaths” as well as “exception s
to this general rule, . . . the administration of oaths and affirmations i s
a purely procedural matter, and it thus falls within the authority o f
our Supreme Court to promulgate rules governing the practices and
procedures for administering oaths.” People v Putman, 309 Mich App
240, 243-244 (2015). Accordingly, “to the extent that MRE 603 conflicts
with MCL 600.1432 and MCL 600.1434, MRE 603 prevails over th e
statutory provisions[.]” Putman, 309 Mich App at 245.
Under MRE 603, “no particular ceremonies, observances, or
formalities are required of a testifying witness so long as the oath o r
affirmation awakens the witness’s conscience and impresses his or he r
mind with the duty to testify truthfully.” Putman, 309 Mich App at 244
(citation, quotation marks, and alterations omitted). There was n o
plain error and the oath “was sufficient to awaken the witnesses ’
consciences and impress the witnesses’ minds with the duty to testif y
truthfully” where the trial court asked each witness “if they promised
to testify truthfully or some similar variation of that question,” and
each witness answered affirmatively. Id. at 244-245 (holding tha t
“[b]ecause the administrations of oaths and affirmations is a purel y
procedural matter, to the extent that MRE 603 conflicts with MCL
600.1432 and MCL 600.1434, MRE 603 prevails over the statutor y

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.4
provisions, meaning that no specific formalities are required of a n
oath or affirmation”).
Committee Tip:
Traditionally, courts have used the following
form: “Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the
testimony you are about to give will be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?”
If a witness is opposed to swearing under oath, he or she may instead
make a solemn and sincere affirmation under the pains and penaltie s
of perjury. MCL 600.1434. Similarly, “witnesses need not raise thei r
right hands when taking an oath to testify truthfully, and such oath s
need not be prefaced with any particular formal words.” Putman, 309
Mich App at 244.
B. Oath for Child Witness
Presumably, the general rules that apply to oaths and affirmations o f
testifying witnesses, also apply to child witnesses. See Section 7.4(A)
for more information. See also M Crim JI 5.9, which states that “[f]or a
witness who is a [young] child, a promise to tell the truth takes th e
place of an oath to tell the truth.” (Alteration in original.)
C. Oath for Interpreter
“An interpreter must be qualified and must give an oath or
affirmation to make a true translation.” MRE 604.
Foreign language interpreters. “The court shall administer an oath or
affirmation to a foreign language interpreter substantially conformin g
to the following: ‘Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will truly,
accurately, and impartially interpret in the matter now before th e
court and not divulge confidential communications, so help yo u
God?’” MCR 1.111(G).
Deaf or deaf-blind interpreters. MCL 393.506(1) requires a qualifie d
interpreter for a deaf or deaf-blind person to swear or affirm to make
a true interpretation in an understandable manner to the deaf or deaf-
blind person and to interpret the person’s statements in the Englis h
language to the best of the interpreter’s ability.

Section 7.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
7.5 Subpoenas
A. In General
MCR 2.506 identifies the process by which a subpoena may be issued.
Subpoenas may compel the attendance of certain individuals a t
various proceedings, require the production of evidence, or enjoin th e
transfer of assets pursuant to MCL 600.6119. See MCR 2.506(A); MCL
600.1455(1).
Subpoenas may be signed by an attorney of record in the action or b y
the clerk of the court. MCR 2.506(B)(1). The court may enforce it s
subpoenas using its contempt power, see MCR 2.506(E), and i s
provided other enforcement options by MCR 2.506(F).
For information on issuing a subpoena based on a foreign subpoena,
see Section 5.6.
B. Subpoena for Party or Witness
MCL 600.1455(1) authorizes courts of record to issue subpoena s
requiring the attendance of testifying witnesses in any matte r
“pending or triable in such courts[.]” See also MCR 2.506(A)(1), whic h
provides “[t]he court in which a matter is pending may by order o r
subpoena command a party or witness to appear for the purpose o f
testifying in open court on a date and time certain and from time t o
time and day to day thereafter until excused by the court[.]”
Whomever signs the subpoena must serve it on the witnes s
“sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to give the witnes s
reasonable notice of the date and time the witness is to appear. Unles s
the court orders otherwise, the subpoena must be served at least 2
days before the appearance or 14 days before the appearance whe n
documents are requested.” MCR 2.506(C)(1). Service requirements ar e
set out in MCR 2.506(G). The issuer of the subpoena bears additional
responsibilities as set out in MCR 2.506(C)(2)-(3).
C. Subpoena Duces Tecum (Subpoena for Production of
Evidence)
A party or witness may be required to produce documents or other
portable tangible things when they appear to testify. MCR 2.506(A)(1).
The request to produce these items must comply with MCR 2.302(B)
and any scheduling order, and a copy of the subpoena must b e
provided to the opposing party or their counsel. MCR 2.506(A)(1).
Subpoenas issued pursuant to MCR 2.506(A)(1) “does not apply t o
Page 7-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 365 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.6
discovery subpoenas (MCR 2.305) or requests for documents to a
party where discovery is available (MCR 2.310).” MCR 2.506(A)(1).
“A subpoena may specify the form or forms in which ES I
[(electronically stored information)] is to be produced, subject t o
objection.” MCR 2.506(A)(2). If the subpoena does not specify the
form or forms in which the information is to be produced, th e
information must be produced “in a form or forms in which th e
person ordinarily maintains it, or in a form or forms that ar e
reasonably usable.” Id. The person producing the ESI only needs t o
“produce the same information in one form.” Id.
A subpoena for hospital medical records is controlled by MCR
2.506(I).
“A person or entity subpoenaed under [MCR 2.506] may file writte n
objections to the request for documents before the designated time fo r
appearance; such objections shall be adjudicated under [MCR
2.506(H)].” MCR 2.506(A)(1). See Section 7.5(D) for information o n
adjudications under MCR 2.506(H).
D. Motion to Quash Subpoena
MCR 2.506(H) provides that a person served with a subpoena unde r
MCR 2.506 may appear and challenge the subpoena in person or i n
writing. The witness may be excused for good cause, with or withou t
a hearing. MCR 2.506(H)(2)-(3). Otherwise, the person must comply
with the subpoena and appear, unless excused by the court or th e
party who had the subpoena issued. MCR 2.506(H)(4). However, any
obligation to produce documents is stayed pending resolution upo n
the filing of timely written objections. Id. Additionally, “[a]ny party
may move to quash or modify a subpoena by motion under MCR
2.302(C) filed before the time specified in the subpoena, and serv e
same upon the nonparty, in which case the non-party’s obligation t o
respond is stayed until the motion is resolved.” MCR 2.506(H)(5).
7.6 Questions or Comments by Judge
A. Generally Permissible Conduct
“A trial judge has a duty to exercise reasonable control over th e
interrogation of witnesses and the presentment of the evidence i n
order to make the interrogation and presentment effective for th e
ascertainment of the truth. Further, the court may properl y
interrogate witnesses, whether called by the party or the court itself.”
Law Offices of Lawrence J Stockler, PC v Rose, 174 Mich App 14, 24 (1989)
(internal citations omitted). See also MRE 614(a)-(b). “There are ‘thre e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-7

Section 7.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
situations in which a trial court has good reason to interject itself int o
the trial: (1) when the trial is lengthy and complex, (2) when attorney s
are unprepared or obstreperous, or if the facts become confused and
neither side is able to resolve the confusion, and (3) when a witness i s
difficult or not credible and the attorney fails to adequately probe th e
witness, or if a witness becomes confused.’” People v Plomb, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2025), quoting People v Davis, 216 Mich App 47, 49-5 0
(1996) (outlining the limited situations in which a trial court ma y
interject itself into the trial). “Questions designed to clarify points and
to elicit additional relevant evidence, particularly in a nonjury trial,
are not improper.” Law Offices of Lawrence J Stockler, PC, 174 Mich Ap p
at 24.
In bench trials, courts are afforded more discretion when questionin g
witnesses. In re Jackson, 199 Mich App 22, 29 (1993) (notwithstanding,
a reversal may be in order when the questions are “intimidating,
argumentative, prejudicial, unfair, or partial”). “Nevertheless, a
judge’s comments and conduct can indicate a possible bias.” In r e
Forfeiture of $1,159,420, 194 Mich App 134, 153 (1992). In order t o
prove bias, a litigant must “show that the judge’s views controlled hi s
decision-making process.” Id. at 154.
B. Judicial Impartiality During a Jury Trial
The discussion in the following sub-subsections addresses judicial
impartiality in the context of a post-trial claim of an unfair and partial
trial. For discussion of judicial bias/impartiality in the context of a
motion for judicial disqualification, see the Michigan Judicia l
Institute’s Judicial Disqualification in Michigan publication. See also th e
Michigan Judicial Insitute’s judicial disqualification checklist an d
flowchart.
“A trial judge's conduct deprives a party of a fair trial if the conduc t
pierces the veil of judicial impartiality.” People v Stevens, 498 Mich 162,
164 (2015). “A judge’s conduct pierces this veil and violates th e
constitutional guarantee of a fair trial when, considering the totality
of the circumstances, it is reasonably likely that the judge’s conduc t
improperly influenced the jury by creating the appearance o f
advocacy or partiality against a party.” Id. at 164. “This inquiry
requires a fact-specific analysis.” Id. at 171. “A single inappropriate ac t
does not necessarily give the appearance of advocacy or partiality, bu t
a single instance of misconduct may be so egregious that it pierces th e
veil of impartiality.” Id. In making this determination, there is n o
presumption in favor of the trial court being unbiased. People v Plomb,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (noting that “neither Stevens nor
[2]
Swilley did so”). But see People v Biddles, 316 Mich App 148, 15 2
(2016) (“A defendant must overcome a heavy presumption of judicial
impartiality when claiming judicial bias.”).
Page 7-8 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 367 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.6
1. Factors for Consideration
“In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, [a] reviewing
court should inquire into a variety of factors including, but no t
limited to, the nature of the trial judge’s conduct, the tone and
demeanor of the judge, the scope of the judicial conduct in the
context of the length and complexity of the trial and issue s
therein, the extent to which the judge’s conduct was directed a t
one side more than the other, and the presence of any curative
instructions, either at the time of an inappropriate occurrence or
at the end of trial.” People v Stevens, 498 Mich 162, 172, 190-191
(2015) (concluding that “it [was] reasonably likely that th e
judge’s conduct with respect to defendant’s expert witnes s
improperly influenced the jury by creating the appearance of
advocacy or partiality against defendant,” and that the judge’ s
curative instruction to the jury “was not enough to overcome the
bias the judge exhibited against the defense throughout the
trial”).
“The fairness of trial and the process that is constitutionally due
to a defendant are implicated when the jury is present and whe n
they are excused.” People v Plomb, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025)
(applying “the multi-factor inquiry on judicial impropriety t o
behavior that occurred outside the presence of the jury at a jury
trial”).
2. Structural Error
“When the issue is preserved and a reviewing court determine s
that a judge has pierced the veil of judicial impartiality, a
structural error has been established that requires reversing the
judgment and remanding the case for a new trial.” People v
Stevens, 498 Mich 162, 178 (2015) (citations omitted). “[J]udicia l
partiality can never be held to be harmless and, therefore, i s
never subject to harmless-error review.” Id. at 179-180 (citation s
omitted).
“[An] unpreserved structural error requires [a defendant] to
show that ‘(1) error occurred; (2) the error was plain, i.e. clear or
obvious, and (3) the plain error affected substantial rights.’”
People v Plomb, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025), quoting People v
Davis, 509 Mich 52, 67-68 (2022).
2See People v Swilley, 504 Mich 350 (2019).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-9
=== Page 368 ===
Section 7.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
3. Analysis of Factors
Nature of judicial conduct. “Identifying the nature of th e
conduct provides the starting point to evaluate whether the
conduct overstepped the line of judicial impartiality.” People v
Stevens, 498 Mich 162, 173 (2015). “For instance, when evaluatin g
a judge’s questioning of witnesses, a reviewing court must firs t
bear in mind that such interrogation is generally appropriate
under MRE 614(b).” Id. “Therefore, it is appropriate for a judg e
to question witnesses to produce fuller and more exac t
testimony or elicit additional relevant information.” Id. (notin g
“the central object of judicial questioning should be to clarify”).
“Judicial questioning, nevertheless, has boundaries.” Id. at 174.
“It is inappropriate for a judge to exhibit disbelief of a witness,
intentionally or unintentionally.” Id. at 174. “It is essential tha t
the judge not permit his own views on disputed issues of fact t o
become apparent to the jury.” Id. (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted); see also id. at 180, 186 (holding that the trial court’s
“repeated questioning of defendant’s expert” invaded the
prosecutor’s role and “projected incredulity, bias, and hostility”).
“It is difficult to distinguish the impact on a trial where a judge
directly questions one party’s witness versus where a judge
directs strategy for one of the parties in a way that results in the
questioning of a key witness.” People v Plomb, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2025). In Plomb, “this strategic advising happened in a
manner that was nonresponsive to the prosecutor’s ow n
objection and out-of-step with the prosecution’s clear strategy
with respect to prior bad acts (which was to not use them).” Id. a t
___. “[W]hile the judge did not actually resort to questioning the
[confidential informant] before the jury, the judge laid out the
specific questions for cross-examination and told the parties tha t
these questions would be asked in front of the jury.” Id. at ___; see
also id. at ___ n 2 (“Notably, at one point the judge did say h e
would do the questioning himself.”). “Just as credibility i s
squarely the responsibility of the jury, strategy is squarely the
responsibility of the attorneys.” Id. at ___ (weighing factor “i n
favor of concluding the judge pierced the veil of judicial
impartiality”).
“‘[I]t is appropriate for a judge to question witnesses to produce
fuller and more exact testimony or elicit additional relevan t
information.’” People v Swilley, 504 Mich 350, 372 (2019), quoting
Stevens, 498 Mich at 173. “However, ‘undue interference,
impatience, or participation in the examination of witnesses, or a
severe attitude on the judge’s part toward witnesses . . . may
tend to prevent the proper presentation of the cause, or the
Page 7-10 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 369 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.6
ascertainment of truth in respect thereto[.]’” Swilley, 504 Mich a t
372, quoting Stevens, 498 Mich at 174 (alterations in original).
“A judge should not exhibit disbelief of a witness intentionally or
unintentionally or permit his own views on disputed issues of
fact to become apparent to the jury, [and a] judge should avoid
questions that are intimidating, argumentative, or skeptical.”
Swilley, 504 Mich at 372-373 (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “[I]t is not the role of the court to impeach a witness or
undermine a witness’s general credibility.” Id. at 373. “Question s
from a judge that are designed to emphasize or expose
incredible, unsubstantiated, or contradictory aspects of a
witness’s testimony are impermissible.” Id. at 374 (the trial
judge’s conduct weighed in favor of finding that he pierced the
veil of judicial impartiality where his “questioning of [the
witness] did not serve to clarify any of the issues or produce
fuller testimony but, instead, served to impeach and t o
undermine the witness’s general credibility”). See also Loranger v
Jageman, 169 Mich 84, 86 (1912) (defendant did not receive a fair
and impartial trial where the jury heard the judge’s opinions o n
the facts of the case).
Tone and demeanor. “To ensure an appearance of impartiality, a
judge should not only be mindful of the substance of his or her
words, but also the manner in which they are said.” Stevens, 49 8
Mich at 175. “Hostile questions from a judge are particularly
inappropriate when the witnesses themselves have done
nothing to deserve such heated inquiry.” Id. “A judge mus t
proceed with particular care when engaging with a criminal
defendant.” Id. “Judicial questioning might be more necessar y
when a judge is confronted with a difficult witness who refuse s
to answer questions posed by attorneys or repeatedly respond s
to those questions with unclear answers, although the manner of
judicial involvement remains at the center of the examination by
a reviewing court.” Id. at 175-176.
“It will often be the case that analysis under this factor will
dovetail with analysis of the nature and type of judicial conduct;
the manner in which the judge’s inquiry is made will affect how
the jury perceives the conduct.” Id. at 186. “To the extent that it i s
appropriate, these factors may be considered together.” Id.
“Because of the jury’s inclination to follow the slightes t
indication of bias on the part of the judge, ‘[t]o ensure a n
appearance of impartiality, a judge should not only be mindful
of the substance of his or her words, but also the manner i n
which they are said.’” Swilley, 504 Mich at 381, quoting Stevens,
498 Mich at 175. Controversial manner, tone, pert remarks, and
quips should be avoided, and “[a]dversarial cross-examinatio n
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-11
=== Page 370 ===
Section 7.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
of a witness by a judge is impermissible.” Swilley, 504 Mich a t
381. While “[j]udicial questioning might be more necessary
when confronted with a difficult witness who refuses to answer
questions or provides unclear answers, . . . judicial interventio n
is less justified when a witness provides clear, responsive
answers, or has done nothing to deserve heated judicial inquiry.”
Id. at 381-382 (the trial judge’s repeated use of questions tha t
suggested the witness’s actions were illogical or unnatural cas t
doubt on the witness’s truthfulness and indicated the judge wa s
skeptical of the witness; the judge’s use of questions to make
substantive points and arguments supported a conclusion of
judicial partiality).
Length and complexity of trial. “In a long trial, or one with
several complicated issues posed to the jury, for instance, it ma y
be more appropriate for a judge to intervene a greater number of
times than in a shorter or more straightforward trial.” Stevens,
498 Mich at 176. “Likewise, given the principle that a judge’ s
questions may serve to clarify points that are obscure or
confusing, a judge’s inquiries may be more appropriate when a
witness testifies about a topic that is convoluted, technical,
scientific, or otherwise difficult for a jury to understand.” Id.
(citation omitted).
However, “when a witness testifies on a clear or straightforwar d
issue, judicial questioning is less warranted, even if the
testimony occurs within the context of a lengthy trial, or one tha t
involves other complex but unrelated matters.” Swilley, 504 Mic h
at 387 (concluding this factor “support[ed] the conclusion tha t
the [trial] judge pierced the veil of judicial impartiality” when he
“intervened extensively and inappropriately” during testimony
that “was not technical, convoluted or scientific”).
Extent judicial conduct was directed at one side. “Judicial
partiality may be exhibited when an imbalance occurs wit h
respect to either the frequency of the intervention or the manner
of the conduct.” Swilley, 504 Mich at 388 (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “This inquiry is therefore twofold: in order t o
determine whether judicial questioning was imbalanced, a
reviewing court must evaluate both the frequency of th e
questions and the manner in which they were asked.” Id. “[T]o
assess whether judicial questioning was imbalanced, [a n
appellate court does] not simply look at the number of question s
but also the nature of those questions.” Id. (“stark difference[s]
between the trial judge’s treatment of witnesses on opposing
sides of [the] case . . . support[ed] a conclusion of judicial
partiality”).
Page 7-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 371 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.7
Presence of a curative instruction. “The presence or absence of a
curative instruction is a factor in determining whether a cour t
displayed the appearance of advocacy or partiality.” Plomb, __ _
Mich App at ___ (cleaned up). “The model jury instructions—
both for civil and criminal trials—emphasize that a
judge’s . . . questions do not constitute evidence and that the jur y
should not attempt to discern the judge’s personal opinion while
considering the case.” Stevens, 498 Mich at 177. “Additionally,
during the course of a proceeding, a trial judge has the ability t o
issue a curative instruction immediately in response to conduc t
that could give rise to the appearance of bias.” Id. “Because it is
well established that jurors are presumed to follow thei r
instructions, a curative instruction will often ensure a fair trial
despite minor or brief inappropriate conduct.” Id. (cleaned up).
“Depending on the circumstances, an immediate curative
instruction may further alleviate any appearance of advocacy or
partiality by the judge.” Id. “That said, in some instances judicial
conduct may so overstep its bounds that no instruction can erase
the appearance of partiality.” Id. at 177-178.
“[A] judge’s administration of curative instructions does no t
always guarantee that a defendant has received an impartial
trial; in some instances judicial conduct may so overstep it s
bounds that no instruction can erase the appearance of
partiality.” Swilley, 504 Mich at 390 (quotation marks and citation
omitted) (although the trial judge instructed the jury throughou t
the trial that he had no interest in the case’s outcome, “hi s
lengthy badgering of [witnesses] suggested the opposite,”
leaving curative instructions “particularly empty”). See also In re
Parkside Housing Project, 290 Mich 582, 599-600 (1939) (judge’ s
repeated curative instructions did not erase the appearance of
partiality in light of his conduct during trial).
7.7 Stipulations
A. On the Record or in Writing
Stipulations must be made in open court or must be in writing and
signed by the parties or the parties’ attorneys on the parties’ behalf.
MCR 2.116(A)(1); MCR 2.507(G). The terms of a stipulation must b e
certain and definite. Whitley v Chrysler Corp, 373 Mich 469, 474 (1964).
Approving an order or judgment as to form and content does no t
constitute a stipulation as to the outcome, unless there is an indicatio n
that the parties have stipulated to the outcome. See Ahrenberg Mech
Contracting, Inc v Howlett, 451 Mich 74, 77-78 (1996). Generally, rules of
contract construction apply to stipulated orders that have bee n
accepted by the trial court. Phillips v Jordan, 241 Mich App 17, 2 1
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-13
=== Page 372 ===
Section 7.8 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(2000) (“contract principles do not govern child custody matters, ”
where the court must “independently determine what is in the bes t
interests of the child”).
B. Stipulation of Fact and Stipulations of Law
Stipulations of fact are permissive, not mandatory. See MCR
2.116(A)(1) (the parties may submit stipulations of fact to the court).
Stipulations of fact are binding on the court. Staff v Johnson, 242 Mich
App 521, 535 (2000). “If the parties have stipulated to facts sufficien t
to enable the court to render judgment in the action, the court shall d o
so.” MCR 2.116(A)(1).
Stipulations of law are not binding on the court. Staff, 242 Mich App
at 535. “It is within the inherent power of a court, as the judicial body,
to determine the applicable law in each case. To hold otherwise coul d
lead to absurd results; for example, parties could force a court t o
apply laws that were in direct contravention to the laws of this state.
It would also allow the parties to stipulate to laws that were obsolete,
overruled, or unconstitutional.” In re Finlay Estate, 430 Mich 590, 595-
596 (1988).
C. Enforcement
Courts should encourage and enforce stipulations that are “designed
to simplify, shorten or settle litigation and save costs to the parties ”
unless there is good cause not to do so. Conel Dev, Inc v River Rouge
Savings Bank, 84 Mich App 415, 419 n 5 (1978).
A trial court has the “equitable power to relieve a party from a
stipulation where there is evidence of mistake, fraud o r
unconscionable advantage taken by one party over the other. ”
Valentino v Oakland Co Sheriff, 134 Mich App 197, 206 (1984), aff’d i n
3
part, rev’d in part on other grounds 424 Mich 310 (1986). A fraud
occurs when a party conceals some material fact from the court o r
makes some material misrepresentation to the court. Valentino, 134
Mich App at 207. The court must conduct an evidentiary hearing t o
determine if the allegations of fraud are true. Id.
7.8 Witness Examination
“The court must exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of
examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to: (1) make thos e
procedures effective for determining the truth; (2) avoid waisting time;
3For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
Page 7-14 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 373 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.8
and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment. ”
MRE 611(a). Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the plaintiff mus t
4
introduce its evidence first. MCR 2.507(B). However, if the defendant’ s
answer admits facts and allegations asserted in plaintiff’s complaint t o
the extent that judgment should be entered in favor of plaintiff, and th e
defendant has advanced a defense (either as a counterclaim o r
affirmative defense) for which the defendant has the burden of proof, th e
defendant must present its evidence first. Id.
“The court must exercise reasonable control over the appearance of
parties and witnesses so as to: (1) ensure that the fact-finder can see and
assess their demeanor; and (2) ensure their accurate identification.” MRE
611(b). Only one attorney for a party is permitted to examine a witness,
5
unless otherwise ordered by the court. MCR 2.507(C).
A. Direct Examination
Leading questions are only permissible on direct examination “a s
necessary to develop a witness’s testimony.” MRE 611(d)(1). See, e.g.,
In re Susser Estate, 254 Mich App 232, 239-240 (2002), where reversa l
was not required when the plaintiff asked leading questions of a n
elderly and infirm witness only to the extent necessary to develop he r
testimony. However, leading questions may be asked of hostil e
witnesses, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an advers e
party on direct examination. MRE 611(d)(1)(B).
B. Cross-Examination
“A witness may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to an y
issue in the case, including credibility.” MRE 611(c). However, th e
trial court “may limit cross-examination regarding matters no t
testified to on direct examination.” Id. See, e.g., Beadle v Allis, 165 Mic h
App 516, 522-523 (1987), where the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion in limiting the plaintiff’s cross-examination of th e
defendant’s expert witness about issues that were “marginall y
relevant to the case as a whole but which [were] beyond the scope o f
the witness’ testimony on direct examination.”
Ordinarily, leading questions are permissible during cross-
examination. MRE 611(d)(1)(A). However, the court is not alway s
required to allow them. Shuler v Michigan Physicians Mut Liability Co,
260 Mich App 492, 517-518 (2004).
4 See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Evidence Benchbook, Chapter 1, for a discussion on the court’s ability
to limit the length of witness questioning.
5See Section 7.6 regarding the calling and questioning of witnesses by the court.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-15
=== Page 374 ===
Section 7.9 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
C. Redirect Examination
Generally, redirect examination must be limited to issues raised
during cross-examination. Gallaway v Chrysler Corp, 105 Mich App 1, 8
(1981). However, “this general rule does not equate to an entitlemen t
to elicit any and all testimony on such topics. Rather, the rules o f
evidence, which require that ‘questions concerning . . . th e
admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court,’ continu e
to apply regardless of whether the questioning at issue is properl y
within the scope of examination.” Detroit v Detroit Plaza Ltd
Partnership, 273 Mich App 260, 291 (2006). In other words, the scope o f
redirect examination is left to the discretion of the trial court.
Gallaway, 105 Mich App at 8.
D. Recross-Examination
Generally, recross-examination is governed by the same rules a s
cross-examination. See People v Jackson, 108 Mich App 346, 348-34 9
(1981).
On recross-examination, the parties may inquire into new matters no t
covered during cross-examination where the new matters are i n
response to matters introduced during redirect examination. People v
Goddard (Kenneth), 135 Mich App 128, 138 (1984), rev’d on other
6
grounds 429 Mich 505 (1988).
7.9 Objections
A party may only claim error in a ruling to admit or exclude evidence if i t
affects a substantial right of the party. MRE 103(a). To preserve a claim of
error regarding the trial court’s ruling on the admission of evidence, th e
party opposing admission of the evidence must timely object or move t o
strike on the record. MRE 103(a)(1)(A). The objecting party must als o
state the specific ground for the objection unless it was apparent from the
context. MRE 103(a)(1)(B). “Evidentiary objections that go beyond
recitation of the pertinent rule of evidence being invoked risk prejudice. ”
Zaremba Equip, Inc v Harco Nat’l Ins Co, 302 Mich App 7, 22 (2013). T o
preserve a claim of error regarding the trial court’s exclusion of evidence,
a party must inform “the court of its substance by an offer of proof,
unless the substance of the evidence was apparent from the context.”
MRE 103(a)(2). Once the court rules definitively on the record (either
before or at trial) a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof t o
preserve a claim of error for appeal. MRE 103(b).
6For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
Page 7-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 375 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.10
“The court may make any statement about the character or form of th e
evidence, the objection made, and the ruling,” and “may direct that a n
offer of proof be made in question-and-answer form.” MRE 103(c).“T o
the extent practicable, the court must conduct a jury trial so tha t
inadmissible evidence is not suggested to the jury by any means.” MRE
103(d). “A court may take notice of a plain error affecting a substantial
right, even if the claim of error was not properly preserved.” MRE 103(e).
7.10 Mistrial
A. Generally
While the issue of mistrial typically arises in a jury trial, it can be a n
issue in a bench trial as well. See, e.g., Bennett v Med Evaluatio n
Specialists, 244 Mich App 227 (2000).
“A mistrial should be granted only when the error prejudices one o f
the parties to the extent that the fundamental goals of accuracy and
fairness are threatened.” In re Flury Estate, 249 Mich App 222, 22 9
(2002).
Where an error cannot be cured by an instruction from the court, a
motion for mistrial is appropriate, but not mandatory. Reetz v Kinsma n
Marine Transit Co, 416 Mich 97, 102 (1982). The Court explained thi s
conclusion by stating:
“A party may have such an investment in time an d
money in a trial at the point when incurable error arise s
that he would rather see the case go to the jury, hopin g
that the jurors will be able to ignore the imprope r
argument. Such a decision is eminently reasonable, bot h
for the individual litigant and the judicial system as a
whole. A trial which has consumed valuable private an d
public resources need not be aborted because the jur y
may have been improperly influenced or distracted b y
closing argument.” Reetz, 416 Mich at 102.
“[T]he cumulative effect of an attorney’s misconduct at trial ma y
require retrial when the misconduct sought to prejudice the jury and
divert the jurors’ attention from the merits of the case.” Yost v Falker,
301 Mich App 362, 365 (2013) (quotation marks and citation omitted )
(holding that although defense counsel “intended to divert the jury ”
through his repeated suggestions during opening statement, cross-
examination, and closing argument “that the jury should find for [the ]
defendant to deter the filing of lawsuits,” retrial was not required
“because a note sent by the jury to the court during deliberation s
unequivocally demonstrated that [defense counsel’s] efforts had no t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-17
=== Page 376 ===
Section 7.10 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
succeeded and that the jury was not prejudiced against the plaintiff’ s
claim”).
Where a party’s improper conduct affects the outcome of a trial, a n
appellate court may reverse even if the appellant’s attorney did no t
attempt to cure the error through objection. Reetz, 416 Mich at 102.
The Michigan Supreme Court explained how these types of cases ar e
reviewed:
“When reviewing an appeal asserting improper conduc t
of an attorney, the appellate court should first determin e
whether or not the claimed error was in fact error and, i f
so, whether it was harmless. If the claimed error was no t
harmless, the court must then ask if the error wa s
properly preserved by objection and request fo r
instruction or motion for mistrial. If the error is s o
preserved, then there is a right to appellate review; i f
not, the court must still make one further inquiry. I t
must decide whether a new trial should nevertheless b e
ordered because what occurred may have caused th e
result or played too large a part and may have denied a
party a fair trial. If the court cannot say that the resul t
was not affected, then a new trial may be granted.
Tainted verdicts need not be allowed to stand simpl y
because a lawyer or judge or both failed to protect th e
interests of the prejudiced party by timely action. ”
Reetz, 416 Mich at 102-103.
B. Sanctions
“[A] court’s inherent power to sanction misconduct . . . includes th e
power to award attorney fees as sanctions when the egregiou s
misconduct of a party or an attorney causes a mistrial. The ability t o
impose such sanctions serves the dual purposes of deterring flagran t
misbehavior, particularly where the offending party may hav e
deliberately provoked a mistrial, and compensating the innocen t
party for the attorney fees incurred during the mistrial.” Persichini v
William Beaumont Hosp, 238 Mich App 626, 640-641 (1999) (the trial
court properly limited the request for attorney fees to only the fee s
associated with time spent during trial; an award of attorney fees a s
mistrial sanctions cannot include the fees associated with trial
preparation or the retrial itself).
C. Standard of Review
A decision on a motion for a mistrial is within the trial court’ s
discretion and will be reversed on appeal only for an abuse o f

discretion that resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In re Flury Estate,
249 Mich App 222, 228 (2002).
Part II: Bench Trials
7.11 Opening Statements
Parties have the right to present opening statements. See MCR 2.507(A).
Unless the parties and the court agree otherwise, “the party who is t o
commence the evidence must make a full and fair statement of tha t
party’s case and the facts the party intends to prove” before introducin g
evidence. MCR 2.507(A). Immediately thereafter, or immediately before
presenting evidence, the adverse party must make a similar statement.
MCR 2.507(A).
The court may impose reasonable time limits on opening statements and
“make separate time allowances for co-parties whose interests ar e
adverse.” MCR 2.507(F). However, the court “must give adequate tim e
for argument, taking into consideration the complexity of the action. ”
Warden v Fenton Lanes, Inc, 197 Mich App 618, 625 (1992). The trial court’ s
decision to limit the time allotted for statements or arguments i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Id.
A. Motion on Opening Statement
A motion for directed verdict may be based upon the insufficiencie s
of the opposing party’s opening statement. Jones v Hicks, 358 Mich 474,
485 (1960). See Section 7.32(C) for additional information on motion s
for directed verdict following opening statement.
Similarly, a defendant may be entitled to a mistrial where he or sh e
demonstrates that the plaintiff made inaccurate statements during th e
opening statement, which prejudiced the defendant. See Schutte v
Celotex Corp, 196 Mich App 135, 142 (1992). See Section 7.10 for
additional information on mistrial.

7.12 Evidentiary Issues
“Bench trials stand in sharp contrast to jury trials. A jury is required t o
consider all the evidence and to render a unanimous verdict, without th e

Benchbook.

Section 7.13 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
need for explanation. In a bench trial, however, the trial court is obligated
to ‘find the facts specially, state separately its conclusions of law, and
direct entry of the appropriate judgment.” People v Wang, 505 Mich 239,
250 (2020); MCR 6.403; MCR 6.410(B). “Because of this, reviewing court s
are provided greater insight into the specific evidence found by the trial
court to support verdicts in bench trials.” Wang, 505 Mich at 250.
Opening the evidence. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, th e
8
plaintiff must introduce its evidence first. MCR 2.507(B). However, if the
defendant’s answer admits facts and allegations asserted in plaintiff’ s
complaint to the extent that judgment should be entered in favor o f
plaintiff, and the defendant has advanced a defense (either as a
counterclaim or affirmative defense) for which the defendant has th e
burden of proof, the defendant must present its evidence first. Id.
Judicial notice. In a jury trial, jurors are allowed to “consider all th e
evidence in . . . light of [their] own general knowledge and experience i n
the affairs of life, and . . . take into account whether any particula r
evidence seems reasonable and probable.” M Civ JI 3.11. A judg e
presiding over a bench trial may view the evidence in a similar light. Se e
Hinterman v Stine, 55 Mich App 282, 285 (1974).
7.13 Court View
“On application of either party or on its own initiative, the court sitting a s
trier of fact without a jury may view property or a place where a material
9
event occurred.” MCR 2.507(D).
7.14 Motion for Dismissal/Directed Verdict
In a bench trial, a directed verdict motion should be treated as a motio n
for involuntary dismissal under MCR 2.504(B)(2). See Stanton v Dachille,
186 Mich App 247, 261 (1990). The standard on this motion is differen t
10
than that for a directed verdict in a jury trial because MCR 2.504(B)(2)
“permit[s a] court to make credibility evaluations and factual findings, ”
and the court, in determining whether to dismiss an action under MCR
2.504(B)(2), is not “required to view the evidence in the light mos t
favorable to [the defendant], to resolve all conflicts of evidence in hi s
favor, or to determine whether there [is] a genuine issue of material fact. ”
Williamstown Twp v Hudson, 311 Mich App 276, 289 (2015). “Th e
involuntary dismissal of an action is appropriate where the trial court,

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.15
when sitting as the finder of fact, is satisfied at the close of the plaintiff’ s
evidence that ‘on the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right t o
relief.’” Samuel D Begola Servs, Inc v Wild Bros, 210 Mich App 636, 63 9
(1995), quoting MCR 2.504(B)(2). The court may determine the facts and
render a judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to rende r
judgment until the close of all evidence. MCR 2.504(B)(2). If the cour t
grants the motion, it must make findings under MCR 2.517. MCR
2.504(B)(2).
7.15 Closing Arguments
Either side may waive its right to present a closing argument. MCR
2.507(E). However, it is reversible error to deny a party’s right to closing
argument. United Coin Meter Co v Lasala, 98 Mich App 238, 242 (1980).
The court may impose reasonable time limits on the closing argument s
and “make separate time allowances for co-parties whose interests ar e
adverse.” MCR 2.507(F). However, the court “must give adequate tim e
for argument, taking into consideration the complexity of the action. ”
Warden v Fenton Lanes, Inc, 197 Mich App 618, 625 (1992).
7.16 Rebuttal
After opposing counsel’s final argument, the party who first presented
the evidence is entitled to present a rebuttal argument to the court that i s
limited to the issues raised in the preceding argument. MCR 2.507(E).
11
7.17 Decision
At the conclusion of the case, the trial court must “find the facts specially,
state separately its conclusions of law, and direct entry of the appropriat e
judgment.” MCR 2.517(A)(1). A court’s decision should include “[b]rief,
definite, and pertinent findings and conclusions on the contested
matters . . . without overelaboration of detail or particularization o f
facts.” MCR 2.517(A)(2). However, “[b]revity alone is not fatal to a trial
court’s opinion because the rule does not require over-elaboration o f
detail or particularization of facts.” Powell v Collias, 59 Mich App 709, 71 4
(1975). Findings are sufficient if it appears that the court was aware of th e
issues and correctly applied the law. In re Cotton, 208 Mich App 180, 183
(1994).
“A court must base its decision on testimony given in open court, no t
extrajudicial information.” Gubin v Lodisev, 197 Mich App 84, 86 (1992).

Section 7.18 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Committee Tip:
When rendering a decision after a bench trial, it
is recommended that the judge cover the
following:
Applicable statutes;
•
Applicable jury instructions;
•
Burden of proof;
•
Any presumptions that may apply;
•
Findings of facts sufficient to show an
•
appellate court that the trial judge was aware of
the issues and correctly applied the appropriate
law;
Conclusions of law; and
•
Entry of the appropriate judgment.
•
A trial court’s conclusions on questions of law are reviewed de novo.
Haliw v City of Sterling Hts (Haliw II), 471 Mich 700, 704 (2005). Findings of
fact are reviewed for clear error. Mulcahy v Verhines, 276 Mich App 693,
698 (2007); MCR 2.613(C). “A trial court’s findings are clearly erroneou s
only where [the reviewing court is] left with a definite and fir m
conviction that a mistake has been made.” Samuel D Begola Servs, Inc v
Wild Bros, 210 Mich App 636, 639 (1995) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
For more information on written and oral opinions, see the Michiga n
Judicial Institute’s Appeals & Opinions Benchbook, Chapter 3.
Part III: Jury Trials
7.18 Right to a Jury Trial
“A right to a jury can exist either statutorily or constitutionally. ”
Madugula v Taub, 496 Mich 685, 696 (2014). Parties to a civil proceedin g
have the right to a trial by jury unless: (1) the action is by its nature jur y
barred; (2) the claim is for equitable relief; (3) the Legislature has no t
provided for the claim to be brought before a circuit court; or (4) th e
Legislature denied the right to a jury. Anzaldua v Band, 457 Mich 530, 549-
550 (1998) (discussing the right to a jury trial in the context of th e
Whistleblower’s Protection Act). In determining whether the right to a
Page 7-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 381 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.19
jury trial exists, the court should first examine “the plain language of th e
statute to determine whether the Legislature intended to provide a
statutory right to a jury trial. Madugula, 496 Mich at 696, 696 n 18 (by firs t
examining the statute, the court may not need to reach the constitutional
question). If no statutory right to a jury trial exists, the court should the n
consider whether a constitutional right exists. Id. at 696. See Const 1963,
art 1, §14 (“The right of trial by jury shall remain, but shall be waived i n
all civil cases unless demanded by one of the parties in the manne r
prescribed by law.”). “The right of trial by jury as declared by th e
constitution must be preserved to the parties inviolate.” MCR 2.508(A).
Whether a party has a right to a jury trial is reviewed de novo on appeal.
Bellevue Ventures, Inc v Morang-Kelly Investment, Inc, 302 Mich App 59, 66
(2013).
Actions seeking only equitable relief. There is no right to a jury trial
where the relief sought is solely equitable in nature. See New Prod Corp v
Harbor Shores BHBT Land Dev, LLC, 308 Mich App 638, 659 (2014).
However, the parties may consent to a jury trial on equitable claim s
under MCR 2.509(D). McPeak v McPeak, 457 Mich 311, 315-316 (1998). I n
McPeak, the defendant appealed the jury verdict, asserting plaintiff’s
claim was equitable in nature and should not have been submitted to a
jury. Id. at 314. The Michigan Supreme Court held that a new trial was no t
warranted even if the claim was equitable in nature because: (1) th e
parties consented to a jury trial where the plaintiff made a jury demand;
(2) both parties participated in jury selection and submitted proposed
jury instructions; (3) both parties mostly agreed on the verdict form; and
(4) the defendant never objected to submitting the issues to the jury. Id. a t
316.
Civil infractions. There is no right to a jury trial for either informal or
formal hearings regarding municipal and/or state civil infractions. MCL
600.8719(1); MCL 600.8721(4); MCL 600.8819(1); MCL 600.8821(4).
7.19 Jury Waiver and Jury Demand
The right to a trial by jury is waived in all civil cases unless demanded b y
one of the parties in the manner prescribed by law. Const 1963, art 1, § 14.
See also MCR 2.508.
A jury demand must be made “within 28 days after the filing of th e
answer or a timely reply,” and it “must be filed as a separate document. ”
MCR 2.508(B)(1). The party must pay the required jury fee at the time th e
demand is filed. Id. Failing to file a jury demand or pay the jury fee
waives trial by jury. MCR 2.508(D)(1). The court’s decision whether t o
grant a late demand for a jury trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-23
=== Page 382 ===
Section 7.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Carrier Creek Drain Drainage Dist v Land One, LLC, 269 Mich App 324, 33 1
(2005).
A jury demand is deemed to apply to all triable issues, unless a part y
specifies the demand only applies to certain issues. MCR 2.508(C)(1).
Within 14 days of service of a limited jury demand, or less time a s
ordered by the court, another party may serve a demand for a jury trial
on other, or all, issues. MCR 2.508(C)(2).
“Waiver of trial by jury is not revoked by an amendment of a pleadin g
asserting only a claim or defense arising out of the conduct, transaction,
or occurrence stated, or attempted to be stated, in the original pleading. ”
MCR 2.508(D)(2).
“A demand for trial by jury may not be withdrawn without the consent,
expressed in writing or on the record, of the parties or their attorneys. ”
MCR 2.508(D)(3). “[T]he ‘on the record’ language . . . encompasses an
expression of agreement implied by the conduct of the parties . . . under a
‘totality of the circumstances’ test.” Marshall Lasser, PC v George, 252 Mic h
App 104, 107-108 (2002) (where the plaintiff demanded a jury trial an d
was awarded a default judgment, the plaintiff’s subsequent participatio n
in bench trial proceedings on the issue of damages precluded him fro m
appealing the damages award on the basis that a jury should hav e
decided the issue).
“A motion for directed verdict that is not granted is not a waiver of trial
by jury, even though all parties to the action have moved for directed
12
verdicts.” MCR 2.516.
7.20 Jury Selection
Parties are entitled to be tried by a fair and impartial jury. Poet v Traverse
City Osteopathic Hosp, 433 Mich 228, 258 (1989). The process by whic h
potential jurors are selected and brought to court is governed by MCL
600.1301 et seq. A random selection process must be used. See MCR
2.511(A)(3); MCL 600.1328.
A. Juror Qualification
Juror qualification is governed by both statute and court rule. Se e
MCL 600.1307a and MCR 2.511(E). To qualify as a juror, th e
individual must:
• be a United States Citizen;
12See Section 7.32 for additional information regarding directed verdict.
Page 7-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 383 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
• be 18 years of age or older;
• reside in the county where the trial is being held;
• reside in the district where the trial is being held if the
trial is being held in a second or third class district court;
• be able to communicate in the English language;
13
• be physically and mentally able to serve as a juror ;
• not have served on a petit or grand jury in a court of
14
record within the last 12 months ; and
• not have any felony convictions. MCL 600.1307a(1).
See Section 7.20(E) for information regarding a challenge to a juror’ s
qualification raised during voir dire.
B. Juror Exemption
An individual over 70 years of age may serve as a juror, but is exemp t
upon submitting a request to be excused from service. MCL
600.1307a(2). Additionally, “[a] nursing mother may claim exemptio n
from jury service for the period during which she is nursing her child
and must be exempt upon making the request if she provides a letter
from a physician, a lactation consultant, or a certified nurse midwife
verifying that she is a nursing mother.” MCL 600.1307a(3).
“An individual who is a participant in the address confidentialit y
program created under the address confidentiality program act . . .
may claim exemption from jury service for the period during whic h
the individual is a program participant.” MCL 600.1307a(4). To obtain
an exemption, “the individual must provide the participation card
issued by the department of attorney general upon the individual’s
certification as a program participant to the court as evidence that the
individual is a current participant in the address confidentiality
program.” Id.
“An individual who is a service member of the United States Armed
Forces may claim exemption from jury service for the period durin g
which the individual is on active duty and must be exempt upo n
making the request of the court and providing a copy of the servic e
member’s orders.” MCL 600.1307a(5). “An individual who is th e
spouse of a service member of the United States Armed Forces ma y
13 “Temporary inability must not be considered a disqualification.” MCL 600.1307a(1)(c).
14For purposes of MCL 600.1307a, “an individual has served as a juror if that individual has been paid fo r
jury service.” MCL 600.1307a(7).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-25
=== Page 384 ===
Section 7.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
claim exemption from jury service for the period during which th e
individual resides outside of this state or the United States due to th e
service member’s active duty status”; “[t]he spouse . . . must b e
exempt upon making the request of the court and providing a copy o f
the service member’s orders.” MCL 600.1307a(6).
C. Composition of Jury Panel
“It is essential to the proper disposition of jury matters that they b e
submitted to and determined by a jury drawn from an array o f
qualified jurors. . . . The selection of a jurors list with reference to sex,
employment, or age does violence to the fundamental precept of th e
jury system that juries should be chosen from a fair cross section of
the community.” Robson v Grand Trunk W R Co, 5 Mich App 90, 97-98
(1966).
The selection process authorizes “any other fair and impartial method
directed by the court or agreed to by the parties.” MCR 2.511(A)(4).
1. Number of Jurors
The minimum number of jurors required in a civil case is six,
unless the parties agree otherwise. MCL 600.1352; MCL
600.8353; MCR 2.514(A)(1). The court may direct that seven or
more jurors be impaneled to sit on the jury. MCR 2.511(B). After
the jury instructions are delivered and the case is ready for
submission to the jury, the names of all jurors impaneled must be
put into a container where the court randomly draws names t o
15
reduce the number of jurors to six. Id. However, by agreemen t
of the parties, the court may allow all of the impaneled jurors t o
16
participate in deliberations. Id.; MCR 2.514(A)(3).
2. Identity of Jurors
Access to juror personal history questionnaires is governed by
court rule and the court’s local administrative order. See MCR
2.510(C)(2).
“The attorneys must be given a reasonable opportunity t o
examine the questionnaires before being called on to challenge
for cause.” MCR 2.510(C)(2). An “attorney’s right to see the juror
questionnaire ends when the trial ends.” Collier v Westland Arena,
Inc, 183 Mich App 251, 254 (1990). After the trial, an attorney
may view a questionnaire pursuant to a court order. Id.
15See Section 7.20(K) for discussion of alternate jurors and removal or substitution of a juror at trial.
16See Section 7.35(D) for discussion of the number of jurors required to reach a verdict.
Page 7-26 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 385 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
The press has a qualified right of post verdict access to juro r
names and addresses, subject to the court’s discretion to consider
jurors’ concerns about safety and privacy. In re Disclosure of Juror
Names & Addresses, 233 Mich App 604, 630 (1999).
Juror questionnaires must be kept on file for at least three years,
unless the chief judge orders them to be kept longer. MCL
600.1315; MCR 2.510(C)(3). The answers on the juror
questionnaires are confidential, unless otherwise ordered by the
chief judge. MCL 600.1315.
17
D. Juror Oath Before Voir Dire
The judge should advise the juror that he or she is about to be swor n
in. See M Civ JI 1.04, which provides:
“I will now ask you to swear or affirm to answe r
truthfully, fully, and honestly all the questions that yo u
will be asked about your qualifications to serve as a
juror in this case. Please stand and raise your righ t
hand.
‘Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you wil l
truthfully and completely answer all questions abou t
your qualifications to serve as jurors in this case?’”
E. Voir Dire
“Voir dire is the process by which litigants may question prospectiv e
jurors so that challenges to the prospective jurors can be intelligentl y
exercised.” Bynum v ESAB Group, Inc, 467 Mich 280, 283 (2002). Eithe r
the court or the lawyers for the parties may conduct voir dire. MCR
2.511(C). If the court examines the prospective jurors, it must permi t
the attorneys for the parties to ask or submit further questions that th e
court considers proper. MCR 2.511(C)(1)-MCR 2.511(C)(2). “In a larg e
measure the scope of examination of jurors on voir dire is within th e
discretion of the trial judge; but it must not be so limited as to exclud e
a showing of facts that would constitute ground for challenging fo r
cause or the reasonable exercise of peremptor y
challenges.”Fedorinchik v Stewart, 289 Mich 436, 439 (1939). The cour t
must provide the prospective jurors with sufficient factual
information so they can intelligently answer the voir dire questions.
Kuisel v Farrar, 6 Mich App 560, 563 (1967).
“Jurors are presumed to be qualified. The burden of proving th e
existence of a disqualification is on the party alleging it.” Bynum v
17See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Oaths and Affirmations Table.

Section 7.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
18
ESAB Group, Inc, 467 Mich 280, 283 (2002). “When the court find s
that a person in attendance at court as a juror is not qualified to serv e
as a juror, the court shall discharge him or her from furthe r
attendance and service as a juror.” MCR 2.511(D). See also MCL
600.1337.
F. Noncompliance with Jury Selection Rules
“Failure to comply with the provisions of [Chapter 13 of the Revise d
Judicature Act] shall not . . . affect the validity of a jury verdict unles s
the party . . . claiming invalidity has made timely objection and unles s
the party demonstrates actual prejudice to his cause and unless th e
noncompliance is substantial.” MCL 600.1354(1).
When information potentially affecting a juror’s ability to ac t
impartially is discovered after the jury has been sworn and the juror i s
allowed to remain on the jury, the defendant may be entitled to relief
on appeal if the defendant can establish that the juror was properl y
excusable for cause and that the juror’s presence on the jury resulted
in actual prejudice. People v Miller, 482 Mich 540, 561 (2008) (a new
trial for a violation of the statutory right to a jury free of convicted
felons pursuant to MCL 600.1307a(1)(e) was not warranted wher e
“[the] defendant failed to establish that he was actually prejudiced b y
the presence of a convicted felon on his jury). The Court emphasized
that although a defendant has a constitutional right to an impartia l
jury, he or she does not have a constitutional right to a jury free o f
convicted felons. Miller, 482 Mich at 547.
19
G. Challenges for Cause
Prospective jurors may be challenged for cause under MCR 2.511(E),
which states:
“The parties may challenge jurors for cause, and th e
court shall rule on each challenge. A juror challenge d
for cause may be directed to answer questions pertinen t
to the inquiry. It is grounds for a challenge for cause tha t
the person:
[20]
(1) is not qualified to be a juror ;
(2) is biased for or against a party or attorney;
18See Section 7.20(A) for information on juror qualification.
19See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Juror Challenge for Cause Flowchart.
20 See Section 7.20(A) for more information on juror qualification under MCL 600.1307a.
Page 7-28 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 387 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
(3) shows a state of mind that will prevent the
person from rendering a just verdict, or has formed
a positive opinion on the facts of the case or o n
what the outcome should be;
(4) has opinions or conscientious scruples tha t
would improperly influence the person’s verdict;
(5) has been subpoenaed as a witness in the action;
(6) has already sat on a trial of the same issue;
(7) has served as a grand or petit juror in a criminal
case based on the same transaction;
(8) is related within the ninth degree (civil law) of
consanguinity or affinity to one of the parties or
attorneys;
(9) is the guardian, conservator, ward, landlord,
tenant, employer, employee, partner, or client of a
party or attorney;
(10) is or has been a party adverse to the
challenging party or attorney in a civil action, or
has complained of or has been accused by tha t
party in a criminal prosecution;
(11) has a financial interest other than that of a
taxpayer in the outcome of the action;
(12) is interested in a question like the issue to be
tried.
Exemption from jury service is the privilege of th e
person exempt, not a ground for challenge.”
In exercising a challenge for cause, the attorney must ascertain th e
disposition of the prospective juror regarding the subject matter of th e
case. Poet v Traverse City Osteopathic Hosp, 433 Mich 228, 235 (1989).
“The success of a challenge depends upon eliciting information fro m
the juror, as well as from other sources, as to the juror’s state o r
condition of mind, as will enable a discretionary judgment to b e
formed by the court as to the juror’s competency.” Id. “[H]owever, th e
decision to grant or deny a challenge for cause is within the sound
discretion of the trial court.” Id. at 236.
The court has the discretion to remove a juror, on its own initiative,
for possible bias. Harrison v Grand Trunk W R Co, 162 Mich App 464,
471 (1987) (the trial court did not abuse its discretion when i t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-29
=== Page 388 ===
Section 7.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
dismissed two jurors because they indicated that they would have a
difficult time being impartial).
“Where a prospective juror expresses a strong opinion but promise s
to remain impartial, “the trial court’s discretionary function should b e
balanced against its obligation to fulfill each litigant’s right to a fai r
trial. By achieving this balance in each case, the act of a trial judge i n
granting or denying a request to remove a potential juror should
represent a decision ever mindful of the constitutional seriousnes s
involved.” Poet, 433 Mich at 236-237. “When balancing discretionary
power with a litigant’s right to a fair trial, a trial judge should, in case s
where apprehension is reasonable, err on the side of the movin g
party.” Id. at 238.
Where a challenge for cause is improperly denied and a party is thu s
compelled to use a peremptory challenge, there is a presumption o f
prejudice. Poet, 433 Mich at 239-240. In determining whether the
degree of prejudice requires a new trial, the Court stated:
“[I]n order to uniformly determine when a trial court’ s
error in overruling a challenge for cause require s
reversal, we will henceforth focus on the causal
relationship between an erroneous denial, its effec t
upon the availability of allotted peremptory challenges,
and how each of these factors influenced the ultimat e
composition of the jury in question.
Accordingly, in the interest of requiring an independen t
and objective manifestation of actionable prejudice, w e
hold that in order for a party to seek relief, . . . ther e
must be some clear and independent showing on th e
record that: (1) the court improperly denied a challeng e
for cause, (2) the aggrieved party exhausted al l
peremptory challenges, (3) the party demonstrated th e
desire to excuse another subsequently summoned juror,
and (4) the juror whom the party wished later to excus e
was objectionable.” Poet, 433 Mich at 240-241.
H. Peremptory Challenges
A peremptory challenge excuses a juror without cause. MCR
2.511(F)(1). In a civil case, each party typically has three peremptory
challenges. MCR 2.511(F)(2). “Two or more parties on the same sid e
are considered a single party for purposes of peremptory challenges.
However, when multiple parties having adverse interests are aligne d
on the same side, three peremptory challenges are allowed to eac h
party represented by a different attorney, and the court may allow th e
opposite side a total number of peremptory challenges not exceedin g
Page 7-30 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 389 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
the total number of peremptory challenges allowed to the multipl e
parties.” Id.
Peremptory challenges must be exercised as follows:
“(a) First the plaintiff and then the defendant ma y
exercise one or more peremptory challenges until eac h
party successively waives further peremptor y
challenges or all the challenges have been exercised, a t
which point jury selection is complete.
(b) A ‘pass’ is not counted as a challenge but is a waive r
of further challenge to the panel as constituted at tha t
time.
(c) If a party has exhausted all peremptory challenge s
and another party has remaining challenges, that part y
may continue to exercise their remaining peremptor y
challenges until such challenges are exhausted.” MCR
2.511(F)(3).
I. Discrimination During Voir Dire
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit s
discrimination during voir dire. Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79, 89
(1986). See also Edmonson v Leesville Concrete Co, 500 US 614, 616 (1991)
(extending Batson to civil cases and holding that discriminatio n
during civil jury selection is prohibited); Pellegrino v Ampco Sys
Parking, 486 Mich 330, 338-339 (2010).
MCR 2.511(G)(1) provides that “[n]o person shall be subjected t o
discrimination during voir dire on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, or sex.” Discrimination during voir dire on the basi s
of any of those factors for the purpose of achieving a balanced,
proportionate, or representative jury in terms of those characteristic s
is not an excuse or justification for a violation of MCR 2.511(G)(1).
MCR 2.511(G)(2).
1. Batson Factors
In Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79, 96-98 (1986), the United State s
Supreme Court set out a three-step process for determining the
constitutional propriety of a peremptory challenge in criminal
cases. Later, the Michigan Supreme Court stated that there is “n o
reason why these standards, developed in the criminal trial
context, are not equally applicable in the civil trial context.”
Harville v State Plumbing & Heating, Inc, 218 Mich App 302, 319 n
9 (1996). The factors are discussed throughout this subsection.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-31
=== Page 390 ===
Section 7.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
a. Prima Facie Showing of Discrimination by the
Opponent of the Peremptory Challenge
“First, the opponent of the peremptory challenge mus t
make a prima facie showing of discrimination. T o
establish a prima facie case of discrimination based o n
race, the opponent must show that: (1) he is a member of
a cognizable racial group; (2) the proponent has exercised
a peremptory challenge to exclude a member of a certai n
racial group from the jury pool; and (3) all the relevan t
circumstances raise an inference that the proponent of the
challenge excluded the prospective juror on the basis of
race.” People v Knight, 473 Mich 324, 336 (2005) (internal
citations omitted), habeas corpus gtd Rice v White, 660 F3d
21
242 (CA 6, 2011).
In the first Batson step, the opponent of the challenge i s
not required to actually prove discrimination. Knight, 47 3
Mich at 336. Rather, “the sum of the proffered facts [must ]
give[] rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose[.]” Id.
at 336-337 (quotation marks and citation omitted). See
also People v Armstrong, 305 Mich App 230, 238 (2014). In
Armstrong, the Court of Appeals concluded that th e
defendant, a member of a cognizable racial group, failed
to demonstrate an inference that the challenge excluded a
prospective juror on the basis of race where the
prospective juror had expressed issues with child care o n
the record and the prosecutor stated that the juror wa s
excused on that basis. Id. at 234-235, 239. While the juror
was the “only black juror in the jury pool,” and the
prosecution only exercised one peremptory challenge, n o
other prospective juror expressed a similar issue wit h
child care. Id. at 239 The Court concluded that given those
facts, “the circumstances did not lead to the inference tha t
the prosecutor dismissed [the juror] because of his race.”
Id.
b. Race-Neutral Explanation for the Peremptory
Challenge by the Challenger
“Once the [opponent of the challenge] makes a prima
facia showing, the burden shifts to the [challenger] t o
21 Although the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal district court’s grant of a conditiona l
writ of habeas corpus to the defendant and vacated his conviction under 28 USC 2254(d)(2), the legal
principles cited by Knight, 473 Mich at 335-348, were not implicated by the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Rice,
and they remain good law. See Rice, 660 F3d at 253-254 (reiterating the Batson process detailed in Knight,
473 Mich at 335-338).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
come forward with a neutral explanation for challenging
[the juror].” Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79, 97 (1986).
Batson’s second step “does not demand an explanatio n
that is persuasive, or even plausible.” Purkett v Elem, 51 4
US 765, 768 (1995). Rather, the issue is whether the
proponent’s explanation is facially valid as a matter of
law. Id. “A neutral explanation . . . means an explanatio n
based on something other than the race of the juror. . . .
Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the
prosecutor’s explanation, the reason offered will be
deemed race neutral.” People v Knight, 473 Mich 324, 33 7
(2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted), habea s
22
corpus gtd Rice v White, 660 F3d 242 (CA 6, 2011).
c. Determination by the Trial Court Whether
Opponent of the Challenge has Established
Purposeful Discrimination
“Finally, if the proponent [of the challenge] provides a
race-neutral explanation as a matter of law, the trial cour t
must then determine whether the race-neutral
explanation is a pretext and whether the opponent of the
challenge has proved purposeful discrimination. It mus t
be noted, however, that if the proponent of the challenge
offers a race-neutral explanation and the trial court rule s
on the ultimate question of purposeful discrimination, the
first Batson step (whether the opponent of the challenge
made a prima facie showing) becomes moot.” People v
Knight, 473 Mich 324, 337-338 (2005) (internal citation s
omitted), habeas corpus gtd Rice v White, 660 F3d 242 (C A
23
6, 2011). “In making a finding at step three, the trial
court is required to assess the plausibility of the race-
neutral explanation ‘in light of all evidence with a bearing
on it.’” People v Tennille, 315 Mich App 51, 64 (2016),
quoting Miller-El v Dretke, 545 US 231, 251-252 (2005).
22 Although the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal district court’s grant of a conditiona l
writ of habeas corpus to the defendant and vacated his conviction under 28 USC 2254(d)(2), the legal
principles cited by Knight, 473 Mich at 335-348, were not implicated by the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Rice,
and they remain good law. See Rice, 660 F3d at 253-254 (reiterating the Batson process detailed in Knight,
473 Mich at 335-338).

2. Caselaw
a. Raising a Batson Challenge
In order to ensure the equal protection rights of
individual jurors, a trial court may sua sponte raise a
Batson issue after observing a prima facie case of
purposeful discrimination through the use of peremptory
challenges. People v Bell, 473 Mich 275, 285-287 (2005).
b. Conducting a Batson Hearing
“[T]rial courts must meticulously follow Batson’s three-
step test,” and the Michigan Supreme Court “strongly
urge[s] [trial] courts to clearly articulate their findings and
conclusions on the record.” People v Knight, 473 Mich 324,
339 (2005), habeas corpus gtd Rice v White, 660 F3d 242
24
(CA 6, 2011). In order to preserve the option of reseating
a juror who was improperly struck, the court should no t
release the challenged juror until the challenge i s
addressed. Knight, 473 Mich at 347.
Committee Tip:
The best practice is to excuse the jury while
conducting a Batson hearing.
c. Improper Application of the Batson Factors
In People v Tennille, 315 Mich App 51, 62 (2016), the trial
court “failed to afford defense counsel an opportunity t o
rebut the prosecutor’s stated reason for dismissing [tw o
African-American] jurors” and failed to make an y
“findings of fact regarding whether the prosecutor’ s
justification for the strikes[, i.e., the jurors’ show of
disgust in reaction to another juror’s assertions that he
would give a police officer’s testimony more credence
than that of another witness,] seem[ed] credible under all
24 Although the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal district court’s grant of a conditiona l
writ of habeas corpus to the defendant and vacated his conviction under 28 USC 2254(d)(2), the legal
principles cited by Knight, 473 Mich at 335-348, were not implicated by the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Rice,
and they remain good law. See Rice, 660 F3d at 253-254 (reiterating the Batson process detailed in Knight,
473 Mich at 335-338).
Page 7-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 393 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
of the relevant circumstances, including whether the
jurors actually exhibited the expressions claimed and
whether the averred reactions were the real reasons for
the strikes.” The trial court “improperly conflated step s
two and three of the Batson framework,” by perfunctorily
“stat[ing] that it ‘accepted’ the prosecutor’s explanation a s
‘a valid race neutral reason’” to deny the challenge, thus,
the trial court did not reach step three. Id. at 62, 68, 71, 73
(because “[the] record [did] not permit a conclusion tha t
the prosecutor’s stated reason for the strikes wa s
nondiscriminatory,” it was necessary to “remand to the
trial court for an evidentiary hearing during which the
trial court [was required to] conduct the third-ste p
[Batson] analysis it omitted at defendant’s trial).
It is important to note the distinction between a Batson
error and a denial of a peremptory challenge: “[a] Batson
error occurs when a juror is actually dismissed on the
basis of race or gender,” whereas “a denial of a
peremptory challenge on other grounds amounts to the
denial of a statutory or court-rule-based right to exclude a
certain number of jurors.” People v Bell, 473 Mich 275, 29 3
(2005). A Batson error is of constitutional dimension, and
is subject to automatic reversal, whereas an improper
denial of a peremptory challenge is not of constitutional
dimension, and is reviewed for a miscarriage of justice if
it is preserved, or for plain error affecting substantial
rights if it is unpreserved. Id. at 293-295.
d. Challenges Based on a Juror’s Demeanor
“When a prosecutor’s sole explanation for a strike reside s
in a juror’s appearance or behavior, the third step bear s
heightened significance. Explanations for peremptory
challenges based solely on a juror’s demeanor are
particularly susceptible to serving as pretexts for
discrimination.” People v Tennille, 315 Mich App 51, 6 5
(2016) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
The prosecution’s proffer of a pretextual explanatio n
gives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. Snyder
v Louisiana, 552 US 472, 485 (2008). At that stage, the tria l
court must weigh the credibility of the prosecutor by
considering “not only whether the prosecutor’s demeanor
belies a discriminatory intent, but also whether the juror’ s
demeanor can credibly be said to have exhibited the basi s
for the strike attributed to the juror by the prosecutor.” Id.
at 477.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-35
=== Page 394 ===
Section 7.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
In Snyder, 552 US at 478, the trial court allowed the
prosecutor to strike a black juror for the race-neutral
reasons that the juror looked nervous, and that, because
of a student-teaching obligation, the juror might return a
lesser guilty verdict (which would obviate the need for a
penalty phase) in order to fulfill his jury duty more
quickly. The United States Supreme Court held that the
trial court clearly erred in overruling the defendant’ s
Batson objection to the prosecutor’s strike of that juror,
specifically noting that “in light of the circumstance s
here—including absence of anything in the record
showing that the trial judge credited the claim that [the
juror] was nervous, the prosecution’s description of bot h
of its proffered explanations as ‘main concern[s],’ and the
adverse inference [that the prosecutor declined to use a
peremptory strike on a white juror with more pressing
work and family obligations]—the record [did] not show
that the prosecution would have pre-emptively
challenged [the juror] based on his nervousness alone.”
Id. at 477-483, 485.
In Thaler v Haynes, 559 US 43, 44 (2010), two differen t
judges presided at different stages of voir dire, and the
judge who decided the peremptory challenges was no t
the same judge who presided when the attorney s
25
questioned the prospective jurors. The prosecutor mad e
a race-neutral challenge to a prospective juror because the
juror’s “demeanor had been ‘somewhat humorous’ and
not ‘serious’ and . . . her ‘body language’ had belied her
‘true feeling.’” Id. In addition, the prosecutor stated tha t
“he believed that [the prospective juror] ‘had a
predisposition’ and would not look at the possibility of
imposing a death sentence ‘in a neutral fashion.’” Id. Th e
United States Supreme Court disagreed with defendant’ s
argument on appeal that “‘a trial judge who did no t
witness the actual voir dire cannot, as a matter of law,
fairly evaluate a Batson challenge,’” stating:
“[W]here the explanation for a peremptor y
challenge is based on a prospective juror’ s
demeanor, the judge should take int o
account, among other things, an y
observations of the juror that the judge wa s
able to make during the voir dire. But Batson
plainly did not go further and hold that a
demeanor-based explanation must be rejecte d
25See Section 7.20(L) regarding substitution of judges after voir dire.
Page 7-36 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 395 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
if the judge did not observe or cannot recal l
the juror’s demeanor. Nor did we establis h
such a rule in Snyder.” Thaler, 559 US at 45, 48.
e. Denial of a Peremptory Challenge
A trial court’s decision to include a juror based on rac e
should be treated the same as if the trial court had
excluded the juror based on race. Pellegrino v Ampco Sys
Parking, 486 Mich 330, 347 (2010). In Pellegrino, the tria l
court denied the defendant’s peremptory challenge
without going through the required Batson analysis and
retained a juror because of her race. Id. at 334-336. The
Michigan Supreme Court found that by failing t o
determine whether the defendant’s peremptory challenge
was racially motivated under Batson, the trial cour t
violated established constitutional principles and was no t
justified or authorized to deny the peremptory challenge.
Id. at 344. The Court stated:
“The trial court’s refusal to allow defendant t o
strike [the] prospective juror . . . withou t
finding any Batson violation led to at least one
member of the jury having been selected, no t
pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria, bu t
precisely on the basis of race. [The juror]’ s
presence on the jury was thus the result not o f
being ‘indifferently chosen,’ as required b y
Batson, but of having been chosen specificall y
on the basis of race. As asserted in Batson, this
inflicts harm on defendant, on the prospectiv e
juror who was excluded because of [th e
juror]’s retention, and indeed on the ‘entir e
community.’ The trial court’s proces s
transformed the jury from a group of mer e
citizens into a group in which a person’s racia l
background became defining, and i t
transformed the selection process from on e
that was neutral in terms of race into one tha t
was predicated on race. While this may be th e
process preferred by the trial court, it is no t
the process set forth by the federal or stat e
constitutions or by federal or state law. ”
Pellegrino, 486 Mich at 345.
The Court emphasized that where a Batson
violation leads to the unlawful inclusion o r
exclusion of a juror, automatic reversal i s
required. Pellegrino, 486 Mich at 348.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-37
=== Page 396 ===
Section 7.20 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
f. Proper Exercise of Peremptory Challenge
Defense counsel’s use of “a peremptory challenge t o
exclude . . . a pregnant, African-American woman” “wa s
not inherently discriminatory, [and survived] plaintiff’ s
Batson challenge” where the “case involved the tragi c
death of a seven-month-old baby,” and “[t]he question s
that defense counsel asked during voir dire show[ed] tha t
he was trying to impanel a jury that would put aside
emotions when deciding the case.” Carlsen Estate v
Southwestern Mich Emergency Servs, PC, 338 Mich App 678,
690, 691, 692 (2021) (defense counsel “asked at least seve n
potential jurors—male and female—whether they made
decisions based more on emotion or on logic”).
“Furthermore, defense counsel exercised only tw o
peremptory challenges, both of which were used o n
jurors who admitted to varying degrees that emotion s
might affect their deliberations” and “[d]efense counsel’ s
exercise of peremptory strikes [did] not show a pattern of
striking jurors on the basis of their gender . . . but o n
counsel’s estimation of whether there were any
indications that a juror, for whatever reason, might no t
view the facts of the case with the level of dispassio n
desired by the defense.” Id. at 692.
26
J. Juror Oath Following Selection
After being selected, the clerk of the court swears in the entire jury.
See MCR 2.511(I)(1), which provides:
“The jury must be sworn by the clerk substantially a s
follows:
‘Each of you do solemnly swear (or affirm) that, i n
this action now before the court, you will justly
decide the questions submitted to you, that, unles s
you are discharged by the court from further
deliberation, you will render a true verdict, and
that you will render your verdict only on the
evidence introduced and in accordance with the
instructions of the court, so help you God.’”
See also M Civ JI 1.10, which provides essentially the same language.
Although the juror oath following jury selection is mandatory, se e
MCR 2.511(I)(1), failure to use the precise language of MCR 2.511(I)(1)
26See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Oaths and Affirmations Table.
Page 7-38 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 397 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.20
will not automatically require reversal of a jury verdict, see People v
Cain, 498 Mich 108, 128-129 (2015) (the mistaken use of the juror oat h
given before voir dire “did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity,
or public reputation of the judicial proceedings” where “the record
reveal[ed] that the jurors were conscious of the gravity of the tas k
before them and the manner in which that task was to be carried out, ”
and the jurors “stated under oath that they could be fair an d
impartial, and the trial court thoroughly instructed them on th e
particulars of their duties”). Although the oath that was administere d
“was not a perfect substitute for the oath required by [MCR
2.511(I)(1)],” the defendant was not entitled to relief based on th e
unpreserved error where he “was actually ensured a fair an d
impartial jury[.]” Cain, 498 Mich at 123, 128-129 (cautioning courts “t o
take particular care that the error that occurred in this case be avoided
in the future”).
K. Alternate Jurors and Removal or Substitution of a Juror at
Trial
The court may direct that alternate jurors be impaneled to sit. MCR
2.511(B). “After the instructions to the jury have been given and th e
action is ready to be submitted, unless the parties have stipulated tha t
all the jurors may deliberate, the names of the jurors must be placed
in a container and names drawn to reduce the number of jurors to 6,
who shall constitute the jury.” Id. The court may retain the alternat e
jurors during deliberations, with the instruction that the alternat e
jurors may not discuss the case with anyone until the jury has bee n
discharged. Id. If a substitution of jurors occurs “after the jury retire s
to consider its verdict,” the judge must instruct the reconstituted jur y
to begin deliberations anew. Id.
L. Substitution of Judge
When a judge is substituted after voir dire, the defendant must sho w
actual prejudice to justify reversal. Brown v Swartz Creek VFW, 21 4
Mich App 15, 21 (1995).
M.Standard of Review
A judge’s decision on the scope of voir dire is reviewed for an abuse o f
discretion. White v City of Vassar, 157 Mich App 282, 289 (1987).
A trial court’s underlying factual findings regarding the first Batson
step (whether the opponent of the challenge has made a prima faci e
showing of discrimination) are reviewed for clear error, and question s
of law are reviewed de novo. People v Knight, 473 Mich 324, 345 (2005).
A trial court’s determination regarding the second Batson factor
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-39
=== Page 398 ===
Section 7.21 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(whether the proponent of the peremptory challenge articulates a
race-neutral explanation as a matter of law) is reviewed de novo. Id. A
trial court’s determination regarding the third Batson step (whether
the race-neutral explanation is a pretext and whether the opponent o f
the challenge has proved purposeful discrimination) is reviewed fo r
clear error.” Id.
7.21 Conducting a Jury Trial
“The trial court must control the proceedings during trial, limit th e
evidence and arguments to relevant and proper matters, and tak e
appropriate steps to ensure that the jurors will not be exposed t o
information or influences that might affect their ability to render a n
27
impartial verdict on the evidence presented in court.” MCR 2.513(B).
7.22 Opening Statements
Opening statements are meant to help jurors understand the viewpoint s
and claims of the parties. See M Civ JI 2.02.
“Unless the parties and the court agree otherwise, the plaintiff . . . , befor e
presenting evidence, must make a full and fair statement of the case and
the facts the plaintiff . . . intends to prove. Immediately thereafter, o r
immediately before presenting evidence, the defendant may make a
similar statement.” MCR 2.513(C). See also MCR 2.507(A). Parties hav e
the right to present opening statements. See MCR 2.513(C); MCR
2.507(A). However, the parties and the court may agree otherwise. See
MCR 2.513(C).
The court may impose reasonable time limits on opening statements.
MCR 2.513(C). See also MCR 2.507(F). However, the court “must give
adequate time for argument, taking into consideration the complexity o f
the action.” Warden v Fenton Lanes, Inc, 197 Mich App 618, 625 (1992). Th e
trial court’s decision to limit the time allotted for statements or argument s
is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Id.
Opening statements must be limited to the issues that are supported b y
the evidence. Wiley v Henry Ford Cottage Hosp, 257 Mich App 488, 50 3
(2003). However, where the statements made are not supported by th e
evidence, reversal is not required unless the reviewing court finds tha t
the aggrieved party was prejudiced by the statements. Id. at 503-504.
27See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Evidence Benchbook, Chapter 1, for discussion of limitations on
evidence.
Page 7-40 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 399 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.23
The trial court has discretion to determine what constitutes a fair and
proper opening statement. Hunt v Freeman, 217 Mich App 92, 9 7
(1996).“The trial court is given very wide discretion in ruling upon th e
content and presentation of opening statements.” Haynes v Monroe
Plumbing & Heating Co, 48 Mich App 707, 712 (1973). It is within the trial
court’s discretion to allow counsel to use visual aids during openin g
statements. Id. at 714.
A. Prejudicial or Inflammatory Remarks
It is reversible error to present arguments that contain irrelevan t
issues not before the court and that are designed to “appeal[] to th e
jury’s bias and prejudice.” Kakligian v Henry Ford Hosp, 48 Mich Ap p
325, 328-329 (1973). In Kakligian (a medical malpractice action), th e
defendants’ attorney repeatedly stated that the plaintiff brought sui t
solely out of vengeance and the jury found for the defendants. Id. at
327-328. Because the statements were aimed at arousing the jury’s bia s
and prejudice, and the trial court did not give a timely curativ e
instruction, the Kakligian Court concluded that the plaintiff wa s
entitled to a new trial. Id. at 329.
B. Motion on Opening Statement
A motion for directed verdict may be based upon the insufficiencie s
of the opposing party’s opening statement. Jones v Hicks, 358 Mich 474,
485 (1960). See Section 7.32(C) for additional information on motion s
for directed verdict following opening statement.
Similarly, a defendant may be entitled to a mistrial where he or sh e
demonstrates that the plaintiff made inaccurate statements during th e
opening statement, which prejudiced the defendant. See Schutte v
Celotex Corp, 196 Mich App 135, 142 (1992). See Section 7.10 for
additional information on mistrial.
7.23 Interim Commentary
“Each party may, in the court’s discretion, present interim commentary a t
appropriate junctures of the trial.” MCR 2.513(D) (only applicable in jur y
trials). See M Civ JI 3.16, which provides for instructions to the jury at the
time interim commentary is allowed.
7.24 Closing Arguments
Closing arguments are meant to help jurors understand the evidence and
the way in which each side sees the case. M Civ JI 2.02.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-41
=== Page 400 ===
Section 7.24 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“After the close of all the evidence, the parties may make closin g
arguments. The plaintiff . . . is entitled to make the first closing argument.
If the defendant makes an argument, the plaintiff . . . may offer a rebuttal
limited to the issues raised in the defendant’s argument. The court ma y
impose reasonable time limits on the closing arguments.” MCR 2.513(L).
See also MCR 2.507(F). However, the court “must give adequate time for
argument, taking into consideration the complexity of the action. ”
Warden v Fenton Lanes, Inc, 197 Mich App 618, 625 (1992).
Either side may waive its right to present a closing argument. MCR
2.513(L). See also MCR 2.507(E). However, it is reversible error to deny a
party’s right to closing argument. United Coin Meter Co v Lasala, 98 Mich
App 238, 242 (1980).
“[A] request for curative instructions or an objection to the instructions i s
necessary to preserve the issue of the propriety of a closing argument. ”
Danaher v Partridge Creek Country Club, 116 Mich App 305, 317 (1982).
A. Scope of Closing Arguments
Counsel may only make arguments regarding facts and issues tha t
have been elicited during the trial. Grewette v Great Lakes Transit, 4 9
Mich App 235, 237 (1973) (finding that deposition testimony that wa s
not part of the record was not a proper subject of summation).
Reversal may be required if a curing instruction is not sufficient t o
counter “either a deliberate and continuous course of conduct or a n
outrageous statement.” Id.
In making a closing argument, “counsel is permitted to dra w
reasonable inferences from the testimony.”In re Miller, 182 Mich Ap p
70, 77 (1990) (an attorney’s use of the phrases “I believe” and “I hav e
to conclude,” was permissible where the attorney “did not depar t
from stating what the evidence showed and what inferences could b e
drawn from the evidence”). “[The] [d]efendant ha[s] the right to as k
the jury to believe his case, however improbable it may . . . [seem]. ”
Hunt v Freeman, 217 Mich App 92, 99 (1996). Attorneys are permitted
some freedom in their final argument, and they may reach differen t
inferences and conclusions than a disinterested and unbiased judge.
Kujawski v Boyne Mtn Lodge, Inc, 379 Mich 381, 385-386 (1967).
B. Remarks Designed to Invite Sympathy From Jury
It is reversible error for the defense to ask the jurors to consider th e
effect that their judgment will have on them personally. Duke v
American Olean Tile Co, 155 Mich App 555, 564 (1986) (plaintiff’ s
counsel suggested that family members of the jurors may be injured
by the defendant’s tile product in the future if the jury returned a
verdict favorable to defendant). However, an isolated invitation to th e
Page 7-42 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 401 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.24
jury to put itself in the defendant’s shoes “without a studied purpos e
to prejudice the jury” is harmless error. Brummitt v Chaney, 18 Mich
App 59, 65-66 (1969). It is also impermissible for an attorney to us e
“rhetoric that attempts to inflame passion and prejudice and tha t
intentionally subverts the jury’s fact-finding role.” Gilbert v
DaimlerChrysler Corp, 470 Mich 749, 774-775 (2004).
It is improper to argue that “‘[n]obody would go through this pai n
and suffering for any sum of money,’” Danaher v Partridge Cree k
Country Club, 116 Mich App 305, 317 (1982) (citation omitted), or t o
suggest how much it would cost to hire someone to suffer the sam e
injuries, Crenshaw v Goza, 43 Mich App 437, 446 (1972).
C. Remarks Involving Witness Testimony
Repeated personal attacks on the integrity of witnesses by counsel i n
argument or in examination constitute reversible error. Kern v S t
Luke’s Hosp Ass’n of Saginaw, 404 Mich 339, 352-354 (1978). In Kern, the
defense counsel repeatedly attacked the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses ’
integrity during cross-examination and closing arguments b y
suggesting (with no evidentiary support) that the witnesses had
colluded with the plaintiff’s attorney to provide false testimony. Id. a t
346. The Court ultimately concluded that these arguments warranted
a new trial because the Court “perceive[d] a studied purpose t o
prejudice the jury and divert the jurors’ attention from the merits of
the case.” Id. at 354.
D. Remarks Involving Opposing Counsel
It is error to call into question the honesty and integrity of opposin g
counsel. Powell v St John Hosp, 241 Mich App 64, 81-82 (2000). See als o
People v Unger, 278 Mich App 210, 238 (2008), where the Court found
that “[t]he prosecution . . . clearly exceeded the bounds of prope r
argument when it suggested (1) that defense counsel had attempted
to ‘confuse the issue[s]’ and ‘fool the jury’ by way of ‘tortured
questioning,’ ‘deliberately loaded questions,’ and ‘a deliberat e
attempt to mislead,’ (2) that defense counsel had attempted t o
‘confuse’ and ‘mislead’ the jury by using ‘red herrings’ and ‘smok e
and mirrors,’ and (3) that defense counsel had attempted ‘to deter [th e
jury] from seeing what the real issues [were] in this case.’” (Second
and third alterations in original.) However, because “the trial cour t
instructed the jury that ‘[t]he attorneys’ statements and arguments ar e
not evidence’ and that ‘[y]ou should only accept things the attorney s
say that are supported by the evidence or by your own common sens e
and general knowledge,’” and because a timely objection and curativ e
instruction may have mitigated the prejudicial effect of th e
prosecutor’s statements, there was no error requiring reversal. Id.
(alterations in original).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-43
=== Page 402 ===
Section 7.25 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
7.25 Rebuttal
After opposing counsel’s final argument, the party who first presented
evidence is entitled to present a rebuttal argument to the court or jur y
that is limited to the issues raised in the preceding argument. MCR
2.507(E); MCR 2.513(L).
7.26 Summation of Evidence and Final Instructions
“After the close of the evidence and arguments of counsel, the court ma y
fairly and impartially sum up the evidence if it also instructs the jury tha t
it is to determine for itself the weight of the evidence and the credit to b e
given to the witnesses and that jurors are not bound by the court’ s
summation. The court shall not comment on the credibility of witnesse s
or state a conclusion on the ultimate issue of fact before the jury.” MCR
2.513(M). See M Civ JI 3.17, which provides instructions to the jury
regarding the court’s summation of the evidence.
“After closing arguments are made or waived, the court must orall y
instruct the jury as required and appropriate, but at the discretion of th e
court, and on notice to the parties, the court may orally instruct the jur y
28
before the parties make closing arguments.” MCR 2.513(N)(1).
7.27 Reference Document
“The court may authorize or require counsel in civil . . . cases to provid e
the jurors with a reference document or notebook, the contents of whic h
should include, but which is not limited to, a list of witnesses, relevan t
statutory provisions, and, in cases where the interpretation of a
document is at issue, copies of the relevant document. The court and th e
parties may supplement the reference document during trial with copie s
of the preliminary jury instructions, admitted exhibits, and othe r
admissible information to assist jurors in their deliberations.” MCR
2.513(E). See M Civ JI 2.14, which provides instructions to the jury on the
use and destruction of a reference document or notebook.
7.28 Jury Note Taking
“The court may permit the jurors to take notes regarding the evidenc e
presented in court. If the court permits note taking, it must instruct th e
jurors that they need not take notes, and they should not permit not e
taking to interfere with their attentiveness. If the court allows jurors t o
take notes, jurors must be allowed to refer to their notes durin g
28See Section 7.33(D) for additional discussion of final jury instructions.
Page 7-44 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 403 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.29
deliberations, but the court must instruct the jurors to keep their note s
confidential except as to other jurors during deliberations. The court shall
ensure that all juror notes are collected and destroyed when the trial i s
concluded.” MCR 2.513(H). See also M Civ JI 2.13.
7.29 Juror Discussion
During a civil trial, jurors may be permitted to discuss the evidenc e
among themselves in the jury room during recess. MCR 2.513(K). If a
court elects to allow juror discussion, it must first “inform[] the juror s
that they are not to decide the case until they have heard all the evidence,
instructions of law, and arguments of counsel[.]” Id. In addition, “[t]he
jurors should be instructed that such discussions may only take plac e
when all jurors are present and that such discussions must be clearl y
understood as tentative pending final presentation of all evidence,
instructions, and argument.” Id.
7.30 Jury Questions
The court may allow the jury to ask questions of any witness. MCR
2.513(I).
If the court permits jurors to ask questions, it must inform the jury “of th e
procedures to be followed for submitting questions to witnesses.” MCR
2.513(I). The court must address any questions to a witness on the juror’ s
behalf, after ensuring “that inappropriate questions are not asked, and
that the parties have [had] an opportunity outside the hearing of the jur y
to object to the questions.” Id. See M Civ JI 2.11 for how to instruct th e
jury when allowing them to question a witness.
7.31 Jury View
A jury view “of property or of a place where a material event occurred ”
may be ordered on motion of either party, by the court on its ow n
initiative, or at the request of the jury. MCR 2.513(J). In a civil case, all
parties are entitled to be present at a jury view. Id. During the view, onl y
“an officer designated by the court[] may speak to the jury concernin g
the subject connected with the trial. Any such communication must b e
recorded in some fashion.” Id.
The purpose of a jury view is not to furnish new evidence, but rather t o
enable the jurors to understand the evidence presented in the courtroom.
Valenti v Mayer, 301 Mich 551, 558 (1942). See also M Civ JI 3.12.
The decision whether to permit a jury view is reviewed for an abuse o f
discretion. West v Livingston Co Rd Comm, 131 Mich App 63, 67 (1983). I n
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-45
=== Page 404 ===
Section 7.32 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
exercising its discretion, the court may consider whether there has been a
change in the interim and whether exhibits have been introduced t o
show the condition of the scene. Id.
29
7.32 Directed Verdict
A. Rule
A party may move for a directed verdict at the close of the opposin g
party’s proofs. MCR 2.516. Specific grounds must be stated. Id. If th e
motion is denied, the moving party may offer evidence “as if th e
motion had not been made.” Id. In addition, a denied motion “is not a
waiver of trial by jury, even though all parties to the action hav e
moved for directed verdicts.” Id.
B. Test Applied by the Court
“When evaluating a motion for directed verdict, the court mus t
consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovin g
party, making all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party’ s
favor.” Chouman v Home Owners Ins Co, 293 Mich App 434, 441 (2011).
“A directed verdict is appropriate where reasonable minds could not
differ on a factual question.” Id. The court should state its reasons or
grounds for granting a motion for directed verdict. Turner v Mut
Benefit Health & Accident Ass’n, 316 Mich 6, 27 (1946).
C. Motion on Opening Statement
Although a motion for directed verdict may be based upon th e
insufficiencies of the opposing party’s opening statement, Jones v
Hicks, 358 Mich 474, 485 (1960), “a directed verdict after an opening
statement is a limited and disfavored action, which is only prope r
where an opening statement, in addition to the pleadings, fails t o
establish a plaintiff’s right to recover,” Young v Barker, 158 Mich Ap p
709, 720 (1987). “The specific test to be used in examining the openin g
statement is whether it encompasses all of the ultimate facts proposed
to be proven and essential to plaintiff’s cause of action.” Fento n
Country House, Inc v Auto-Owners Ins Co, 63 Mich App 445, 449 (1975)
(granting the plaintiff a directed verdict after the defendant’s opening
statement, where the defendant’s pleadings and opening statemen t
were insufficient to establish the claimed affirmative defense).
29 For more information on directed verdicts in a bench trial, see Section 7.14.
Page 7-46 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 405 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.33
D. Standard of Review
The trial court’s decision on a motion for directed verdict is reviewed
de novo. Sniecinski v BCBSM, 469 Mich 124, 131 (2003). The trial
court’s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. Samuel D Begol a
Servs, Inc v Wild Bros, 210 Mich App 636, 639 (1995) (equitable action).
7.33 Jury Instructions
A. Pretrial Instructions
“After the jury is sworn and before evidence is taken, the court shall
orally provide the jury with pretrial instructions reasonably likely t o
assist in its consideration of the case. Such instructions, at a
minimum, shall communicate the duties of the jury, trial procedure,
and the law applicable to the case as are reasonably necessary t o
enable the jury to understand the proceedings and the evidence. Th e
jury also shall be orally instructed about the elements of all civil
claims . . . , as well as the legal presumptions and burdens of proof .
The court shall also provide each juror with a written copy of suc h
instructions. MCR 2.512(D)(2) [(requiring that pertinent portions of
the instructions approved by the Committee on Model Civil Jur y
Instructions, or a predecessor committee, be given)] does not apply t o
30
such preliminary instructions.” MCR 2.513(A).
B. Interim Instructions
“At any time during the trial, the court may, with or without request,
instruct the jury on a point of law if the instruction will materially ai d
the jury in understanding the proceedings and arriving at a jus t
verdict.” MCR 2.512(B)(1).
The court must also instruct the jury on the applicable law, issue s
presented, and if requested under MCR 2.512(A)(2), a party’s theory
of the case. MCR 2.512(B)(2). These instructions may be give n
“[b]efore or after arguments, or at both times, as the court elects.” Id.
C. Request for Instructions
Parties must file a written request for instructions within a tim e
period reasonably directed by the court. MCR 2.512(A)(1). If a time
has not been directed by the court, a written request for instruction s
must be made at or before the close of the evidence. Id. See also MCR
2.513(N)(1). “A copy of the requested instructions must be served o n
30See Section 7.33(E) for additional information on model civil jury instructions.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-47
=== Page 406 ===
Section 7.33 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
the adverse party in accordance with MCR 2.107.” MCR 2.512(A)(3).
“The court shall inform the attorneys of its proposed action on th e
requests before their arguments to the jury.” MCR 2.512(A)(4).
31
D. Final Instructions
1. Required Instructions
The trial court must orally instruct the jury after closing
arguments are made or waived. MCR 2.513(N)(1). However, th e
trial court has the discretion (after giving notice to the parties) t o
orally instruct the jury before the parties give their closin g
arguments. Id. If instructions are given before closing
arguments, the trial court may give any appropriate further
instructions afterwards. Id.
MCR 2.513(N)(1) gives “the trial court broad authority to carry
out its duty to instruct the jury properly, and this authority
extends to instructing the jury even during deliberations.” People
v Craft, 325 Mich App 598, 607 (2018). “There is nothing in th e
court rules that precludes the trial court from supplementing it s
original instructions . . . , nor is there anything in the rules t o
suggest that a party’s acquiescence to the original instruction s
[bars] the trial court [from] supplementing its instructions.” Id.
2. Soliciting Questions from the Jury
As part of its final instructions, the court must “advise the jury
that it may submit in a sealed envelope given to the bailiff any
written questions about the jury instructions that arise during
deliberations.” MCR 2.513(N)(2). In addition, after orall y
delivering its final instructions, the court must “invite the juror s
to ask any questions in order to clarify the instructions before
they retire to deliberate.” Id.
If questions arise during deliberation, “the court and the partie s
shall convene, in the courtroom or by other agreed-upo n
means,” so that the question may be read into the record and the
attorneys can offer suggestions for an appropriate response.
MCR 2.513(N)(2). The court has discretion whether to provide
the jury with a specific response, but must respond to all
questions asked by the jury, “even if the response consists of a
directive for the jury to continue its deliberations.” Id.
31See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Final Matters Before Releasing the Jury to Deliberate Checklist.
Page 7-48 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 407 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.33
3. Providing Copies of Instructions
The court must provide the jury with a written copy of the final
instructions to take into the jury room during deliberations.
MCR 2.513(N)(3). If a juror requests additional copies, the cour t
may provide them as necessary. Id. The court also has discretio n
to provide the jury with a copy of electronically recorded
instructions.” Id.
4. Clarifying or Amplifying Instructions
“When it appears that a deliberating jury has reached a n
impasse, or is otherwise in need of assistance, the court may
invite the jurors to list the issues that divide or confuse them i n
the event that the judge can be of assistance in clarifying or
32
amplifying the final instructions.” MCR 2.513(N)(4).
Committee Tip:
Before releasing the jury to deliberate, it may be
helpful to review the verdict form with jurors and
inquire if they have any questions regarding the
form. The court will also need to address th e
release and instruction of alternate jurors. See
Section 7.20(K) for more information.
The court should inquire if the parties and their
counsel are satisfied with the instructions on the
record. Express approval of the instructions
serves as a waiver to any error upon appellate
review. See People v Kowalski, 489 Mich 488,
504-505, (2011).
E. Model Civil Jury Instructions
“A model jury instruction does not have the force and effect of a cour t
rule.” MCR 2.512(D)(1).
MCR 2.512(D)(2) provides:
“Pertinent portions of the instructions approved by th e
Committee on Model Civil Jury Instructions . . . or [its ]
32See Section 7.34(D) for discussion of a hung jury.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-49
=== Page 408 ===
Section 7.33 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
predecessor committee must be given in each action i n
which jury instructions are given if
(a) they are applicable,
(b) they accurately state the applicable law, and
33
(c) they are requested by a party.”
Whether a model jury instruction is applicable and accurate is a
matter within the trial court’s discretion. Alfieri v Bertorelli, 295 Mic h
App 189, 197 (2012).
A trial court’s failure to give a requested, applicable, and accurat e
model jury instruction does not amount to reversible error unless th e
noncompliance results in “such unfair prejudice to the complainin g
party that the failure to vacate the jury verdict would be inconsisten t
with substantial justice.” Johnson v Corbet, 423 Mich 304, 327 (1985)
34
(quotation marks omitted).
If the court decides to give an instruction when no instruction i s
recommended by the committee, the court must specifically find “for
reasons stated on the record that (a) the instruction is necessary t o
state the applicable law accurately, and (b) the matter is no t
adequately covered by other pertinent model jury instructions.” MCR
2.512(D)(3).
F. Supplemental Instructions
MCR 2.512(D)(4) provides:
“This subrule does not limit the power of the court t o
give additional instructions on applicable law no t
covered by the model instructions. Additional
instructions, when given, must be patterned as nearly a s
practicable after the style of the model instructions an d
must be concise, understandable, conversational,
unslanted, and nonargumentative.”
It is within the trial court’s discretion whether a supplemental
instruction requested by a party is applicable and accurate. Silberstein
v Pro-Golf of America, Inc, 278 Mich App 446, 451 (2008). However,
“when the [model] jury instructions do not accurately cover an are a
and a party requests a supplemental instruction, the trial court i s
33MCR 2.512(D)(2) does not apply to preliminary jury instructions. MCR 2.513(A).
34The Johnson Court considered a violation of MCR 2.516(D)(2), which is substantially similar to current
MCR 2.512(D)(2).
Page 7-50 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 409 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.33
obligated to give the instruction if it properly informs the jury of th e
applicable law and is supported by the evidence.” Id.
G. Objections to Instructions
A party may object to the giving or the failure to give a jur y
instruction, “only if the party objects on the record before the jur y
retires to consider the verdict (or, in the case of instructions give n
after deliberations have begun, before the jury resume s
deliberations)[.]” MCR 2.512(C). Objections must “stat[e] specificall y
the matter to which the party objects and the grounds for th e
objection.” Id. The court must give the objecting party the opportunity
to make the objection without the jury present. Id.
The “only if” language in MCR 2.512(C) “does not act as a bar t o
proceedings in the trial court, but rather as a restriction on appeal. ”
People v Craft, 325 Mich App 598, 605 (2018). Accordingly, “a party ca n
alter its position on the appropriateness of jury instructions [durin g
trial court proceedings] when a question is subsequently raised,” an d
“is not barred from asking for supplemental instructions even if th e
party . . . earlier acquiesced to the original . . . instructions.” Id. at 600,
605 (finding the prosecutor did not waive, and was not estopped,
from arguing in favor of supplemental instructions after approvin g
the original instructions).
H. Statement of Issues and Theory of Case
“[A]fter the close of the evidence, each party shall submit in writing t o
the court a statement of the issues and may submit the party’s theor y
of the case regarding each issue. The statement must be concise, b e
narrative in form, and set forth as issues only those disputed
propositions of fact that are supported by the evidence. The theor y
may include those claims supported by the evidence or admitted. ”
MCR 2.512(A)(2). “The court need not give the statements of issues or
theories of the case in the form submitted” by the parties, so long a s
“the court presents to the jury the material substance of the issues an d
theories of each party.” MCR 2.512(A)(5).
I. Standard of Review
Claims of instructional error are reviewed de novo, with th e
instructions being examined as a whole to determine if reversibl e
error occurred. Case v Consumers Power Co, 463 Mich 1, 6 (2000). “Eve n
if somewhat imperfect, instructions do not create error requirin g
reversal if, on balance, the theories of the parties and the applicabl e
law are adequately and fairly presented to the jury.” Id.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 7-51
=== Page 410 ===
Section 7.34 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“Without an objection to the trial court’s instructions, appellat e
review is foreclosed unless the complaining party has suffered
manifest injustice.” Hickey v Zezulka, 177 Mich App 606, 616 (1989),
35
aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds 439 Mich 408 (1992).
“Manifest injustice occurs where the defect in instruction is of suc h
magnitude as to constitute plain error, requiring a new trial, or wher e
it pertains to a basic and controlling issue in the case.” Phinney v
Perlmutter, 222 Mich App 513, 557 (1997).
7.34 Jury Issues Arising During Deliberations
A. Communication with the Jury
There are three categories of communication with a deliberating jur y
(substantive, administrative, and housekeeping). People v France, 43 6
36
Mich 138, 142-143 (1990). Ordinarily, any communication with a
jury should occur in open court and in the presence of, or after notic e
to, the parties or their attorneys. Wilson v Hartley, 365 Mich 188, 18 9
(1961). However, absence of the parties or their attorneys may preven t
reversal where the communication occurred in open court and wa s
recorded. Salvatore v Harper Woods, 372 Mich 14, 20-21 (1963). The
Michigan Supreme Court stated:
“[C]ounsel’s absence from the courtroom when a jur y
returns for further instructions does not bar the tria l
judge from proceeding, [but] he should not do so unles s
undue delay of the jury’s deliberations would result or
unless counsel have agreed by stipulation on the recor d
to permit such further instruction in their absence. ”
Salvatore, 372 Mich at 21.
1. Substantive
“Substantive communication encompasses supplemental
instructions on the law given by the trial court to a deliberating
jury. A substantive communication carries a presumption of
prejudice in favor of the aggrieved party regardless of whether
an objection is raised. The presumption may only be rebutted by
a firm and definite showing of an absence of prejudice.” People v
France, 436 Mich 138, 143 (1990).
35For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
36The Michigan Supreme Court stated that the France holding applies to both criminal and civil
proceedings. France, 436 Mich at 142 n 3.
Page 7-52 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 411 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.34
2. Administrative
“Administrative communications include instructions regarding
the availability of certain pieces of evidence and instructions tha t
encourage a jury to continue its deliberations. An administrative
communication carries no presumption. The failure to objec t
when made aware of the communication will be taken a s
evidence that the administrative instruction was not prejudicial.
Upon an objection, the burden of persuasion lies with the
nonobjecting party to demonstrate that the communicatio n
lacked any prejudicial effect.” People v France, 436 Mich 138, 14 3
(1990).
Instruction from the trial court to the jury on how to complete
the verdict form is an administrative communication. Meyer v
City of Center Line, 242 Mich App 560, 565 (2000).
3. Housekeeping
“Housekeeping communications are those which occur betwee n
a jury and a court officer regarding meal orders, rest roo m
facilities, or matters consistent with general ‘housekeeping’
needs that are unrelated in any way to the case being decided. A
housekeeping communication carries the presumption of n o
prejudice. First, there must be an objection to the
communication, and then the aggrieved party must make a fir m
and definite showing which effectively rebuts the presumptio n
of no prejudice.” People v France, 436 Mich 138, 143 (1990).
Committee Tips:
In anticipation of questions, provide the jury with
envelopes and paper for questions.
When preparing a written response to a written
jury question:
Meet with attorneys to see if an agreement
•
can be reached on a response;
Have attorneys review the written response;
•
When next on the record, describe the
•
question, the agreement with counsel, and the
response;
Always obtain consent of counsel, on the
•

Section 7.34 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
B. Materials in Jury Room
The court must allow the jurors to take their notes (if they were
37 38
permitted to take notes) and final jury instructions into the jur y
room when retiring to deliberate. MCR 2.513(O). The court may allow
the jurors to take the reference document (if prepared under MCR
2.513(E)) and any exhibits or writings admitted into evidence into th e
39
jury room when retiring to deliberate. MCR 2.513(O).
A defendant may be granted a new trial when the jury consider s
material not in evidence if the defendant can show “(1) that the jur y
was . . . exposed to an extraneous influence and (2) that the influenc e
created a real and substantial possibility [that] could have affected th e
jury’s verdict.” Unibar Maintenance Servs, Inc v Saigh, 283 Mich Ap p
609, 627 (2009) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “With respec t
to the second element, a defendant must demonstrate that th e
extraneous influence is substantially related to a material aspect of th e
case and that there is a direct connection between the extrinsi c
material and the adverse verdict.” Id. In Unibar, the trial cour t
properly denied the defendants’ motion for a new trial on the basis o f
the jury’s consideration of extraneous evidence because th e
defendants failed to show that the jury foreperson’s chart, time line o f
events, and summary of the trial testimony were prepared outside o f
the jury room or that the foreperson’s material contained informatio n
not presented at trial. Id. at 627-628.
C. Requests to Review Testimony or Evidence
If, after retiring to deliberate, the jury requests to review an y
testimony or evidence that has not been allowed into the jury roo m
under MCR 2.513(O), “the court must exercise its discretion to ensur e
fairness and to refuse unreasonable requests, but it may not refuse a
reasonable request.” MCR 2.513(P).
If a court decides to permit the jury to review requested testimony, i t
may “make a video or audio recording of witness testimony, o r
prepare an immediate transcript of such testimony, and such tape o r
transcript, or other testimony or evidence, may be made available t o
the jury for its consideration.” MCR 2.513(P).
37 See Section 7.28 for information on jury note taking.
38 See Section 7.33(D)(3) for information on providing copies of final jury instructions to the jurors.
39See Section 7.27 for additional information on reference documents.
Page 7-54 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 413 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.34
If a court decides not to permit the jury to review requested testimon y
or evidence, it may order the jury to continue deliberating, “as long a s
the possibility of having the testimony or evidence reviewed at a late r
time is not foreclosed.” MCR 2.513(P).
D. Hung Jury
“When it appears that a deliberating jury has reached an impasse, o r
is otherwise in need of assistance, the court may invite the jurors t o
list the issues that divide or confuse them in the event that the judg e
can be of assistance in clarifying or amplifying the final instructions. ”
MCR 2.513(N)(4). However “[t]he court may discharge a jury from th e
action . . . whenever the jurors have deliberated and it appears tha t
they cannot agree.” MCR 2.514(C)(4). If the jury is discharged, th e
court may order a new trial before a new jury. MCR 2.514(C).
A hung jury does not constitute an adjudication on the merits or a
final judgment. Andrews v Donnelly (After Remand), 220 Mich App 206,
209-210 (1996) (res judicata does not bar the relitigation of a clai m
40
following a mistrial ).
Committee Tips:
If a jury appears to be deadlocked, read M Civ JI
60.02 to see if that prompts a verdict.
Consider asking the jury certain questions, such
as:
Is the jury deadlocked?
•
How long has it been deadlocked?
•
Has there been any change in the voting one
•
way or the other?
Do the jurors appear to have fundamental
•
differences that cannot be resolved?
If the trial court decides to declare a mistrial,
explain to the jury on the record that the
declaration of a mistrial is discretionary with the
court, and that the court is exercising its
discretion in light of the information received
regarding the state of the jury deliberations.
40See Section 2.17 for further discussion of res judicata.

7.35 Verdict
A. Number
When a jury trial is requested in a civil action, “the trial shall be by a
jury of 6.” MCL 600.1352. “Except in cases involving the possible
commitment of a person to a mental, correctional or trainin g
institution, a verdict in any civil case . . . shall be received when 5
jurors agree.” Id. The parties may stipulate to a jury of all juror s
impaneled, to a jury of less than six, or a verdict by an agreed
majority. MCR 2.514(A). Where a less than a unanimous jury i s
permitted, the same jurors who agree on liability must also agree o n
damages. Klanseck v Anderson Sales & Svc, Inc, 136 Mich App 75, 84
42
(1984).
For information on handling a hung jury, see Section 7.34(D).
B. Polling the Jury
When the jury returns its verdict, “[a] party may require a poll to b e
taken by the court asking each juror if it is his or her verdict.” MCR
2.514(B)(2). “If the number of jurors agreeing is less than required, the
jury must be sent back for further deliberation[.]” MCR 2.514(B)(3).
Accordingly, “once a jury has been polled and discharged, it s
members may not challenge mistakes or misconduct inherent in th e
verdict.” Put v FKI Indus, Inc, 222 Mich App 565, 569 (1997). However,
before being discharged, a jury may change the form and substance o f
a verdict to coincide with its intention; the jury may be allowed t o
reconvene where, after the jury has announced its verdict, a poll o f
the jurors indicates that they might be confused. Id. at 569-570.
Allowing the jury to resume deliberations furthers the purpose o f
43
MCR 2.514(B)(2). Put, 222 Mich App at 570.
After a jury has been polled and discharged, testimony and affidavit s
by the jury members may only be used to challenge the verdict wit h
regard to extraneous matters, like undue influence, or to correc t
clerical errors in the verdict in matters of form. Hoffman v Spartan
41 See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Verdict Checklist.
42The Klanseck Court considered former GCR 1963, 512.1, which provided “in civil cases, tried by six jurors,
a verdict shall be received when five jurors agree.” Klanseck, 136 Mich App at 84. The language of GCR
1963, 512.1 is substantially similar to MCL 600.1352.
43 Effective September 1, 2011, ADM 2005-19 amended several court rules as part of an effort to promote
jury reform. Some rules were affected substantively, and some were only affected ministerially. Put, 22 2
Mich App at 565, discussed former MCR 2.512(B)(2), which was renumbered and only affected
ministerially.
Page 7-56 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 415 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 7.35
Stores, Inc, 197 Mich App 289, 293-294 (1992). Clerical errors include
transcription or transmission of the jury’s verdict. Id. at 294.
C. Special Verdict
“The court may require the jury to return a special verdict in the for m
of a written finding on each issue of fact, rather than a general
verdict.” MCR 2.515(A). The form of a special verdict must be settled
on the record or in writing, “in advance of argument and in th e
absence of the jury[.]” Id. “The court may submit to the jury:
(1) written questions that may be answere d
categorically and briefly;
(2) written forms of the several special findings tha t
might properly be made under the pleadings an d
evidence; or
(3) the issues by another method, and require th e
written findings it deems most appropriate.” MCR
2.515(A).
The court must adequately instruct the jury on the matter submitted
so that the jury is able to make findings on each issue. MCR 2.515(A).
The court must enter judgment in accordance with the special verdict.
MCR 2.515(B).
Where the court omits from the special verdict form an issue of fac t
that was raised in the pleadings or the evidence, a party must demand
its submission before the jury retires, or else the party is deemed t o
have waived the right to a jury trial on that issue. MCR 2.515(C). “Th e
court may make a finding with respect to an issue omitted without a
demand. If the court fails to do so, it is deemed to have made a
finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.” Id.
Unlike a general verdict, which “is either all wrong or all right,
because it is an inseparable and inscrutable unit,” errors in a special
verdict can be “localized so that the sound portions of the verdict ma y
be saved and only the unsound portions [are] subject t o
redetermination through a new trial.” Sudul v Hamtramck, 221 Mich
App 455, 458-459 (1997) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
D. Inconsistent Verdicts
“Ordinarily, a verdict may and should be set aside and a new tria l
granted where [the verdict] is self-contradictory, inconsistent, o r
incongruous, and such relief should, as a rule, be granted where mor e
than one verdict [is] returned in the same action and they ar e

Section 7.35 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
inconsistent and irreconcilable.” Harrington v Velat, 395 Mich 359, 36 0
(1975) (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, every
attempt must be made to harmonize a jury’s verdicts; the verdict s
should be disturbed only where they are “so logically and legall y
inconsistent that they cannot be reconciled[.]” Lagalo v Allied Corp, 45 7
Mich 278, 282 (1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted) .
“Moreover, the Court Rules do not provide an avenue to a new trial
based on an inconsistency or incongruity in the jury’s conclusions. ”
Zaremba Equip, Inc v Harco Nat’l Ins Co, 302 Mich App 7, 29 (2013).
A verdict is not inconsistent if there is an interpretation of th e
evidence that provides a logical explanation for the findings of th e
jury. Lagalo, 457 Mich at 282.

Section 8.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
8.1 Judgments
A. Entry of Judgment (Order)
Except as otherwise provided in MCR 2.602 and MCR 2.603, “all
judgments and orders must be in writing, signed by the court, and
dated with the date they are signed.” MCR 2.602(A)(1). The date th e
judgment or order is signed is the date of entry, MCR 2.602(A)(2), and
the signed judgment or order must be retained in the case file, MCR
2.602(D). “Where electronic filing is implemented, judgments and
orders must be issued under the seal of the court.” MCR 2.602(A)(4).
Immediately before the judge’s signature, the judgment must stat e
“whether it resolves the last pending claim and closes the case.” MCR
2.602(A)(3). “Such a statement must also appear on any other order
that disposes of the last pending claim and closes the case.” Id.
Committee Tip:
Review a final order or judgment before signing
and entering it to make sure the document
indicates whether it resolves the last pending
claim and closes the case. This will assist the
clerk’s office in knowing how to process the
order or judgment prevent the need to enter a
separate administrative order closing the case in
the future.
1
With the exception of default judgments governed by MCR 2.601(B),
“every final judgment may grant the relief to which the party i n
whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has no t
demanded that relief in his or her pleadings.” MCR 2.601(A).
The court must enter a judgment or order using one of the followin g
methods:
• The court may sign the judgment or order when the
relief in the order or judgment is granted. MCR
2.602(B)(1).
• The court must sign the judgment or order when all
parties approve of its form, as long as it is consisten t
with the court’s decision. MCR 2.602(B)(2). For approval
of an order’s form, “the parties must agree regarding th e
1See Section 4.11 for information regarding the entry of defaults and default judgments.
Page 8-2 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 419 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.1
order’s structure or, if relevant, any procedure that i t
may establish for the disposition of the matter before th e
court.” In re Leete Estate, 290 Mich App 647, 657 (2010).
• The court must sign a properly submitted proposed
judgment or order if no written objections have been
filed within 7 days after service of notice, as long as th e
judgment or order is consistent with the court’s decision .
MCR 2.602(B)(3). (This is commonly referred to as the
“Seven-Day Rule.”)
• “A party may prepare a proposed judgment or order and
notice it for settlement before the court.” MCR
2.602(B)(4). A motion fee may not be charged. Id.
While “a court speaks through its written orders and not its oral
pronouncements, the orders and judgments arising from MCR
2.602(B)(3) are to comport with [the court’s] earlier oral
pronouncements.” Jones v Jones, 320 Mich App 248, 261 n 5 (2017)
(internal citation omitted). Accordingly, “if the court modifies what i t
previously stated orally, some type of explanation, at a minimum,
would be warranted.” Id. (holding that the trial court erred by
entering the plaintiff’s proposed judgment, which “did not compor t
with [the court’s] earlier oral ruling”).
MCR 2.602(B)(3) “only comes into effect after the trial court actuall y
grants a judgment.” Hein v Hein, 337 Mich App 109, 123 (2021). “It s
plain terms provide that it is a mechanism for the entry of an order o r
judgment reflecting a decision made by the trial court. Thus, it i s
definitionally not a mechanism for entering a consent judgment, no r
can it be a mechanism for entering an order that is not an effectuatio n
of a trial court’s ruling.” Id. at 123-124.
A party objecting to the entry of a proposed judgment under MCR
2.602(B)(3) is not required to provide a transcript of the prior
proceeding. Jones, 320 Mich App at 261 (holding that the trial cour t
erred by rejecting the defendant’s objections to the proposed
judgment based on the lack of a transcript and noting that “given th e
compressed timing requirements under [MCR 2.602], it is doubtful
that timely obtaining a copy of a transcript would be possible in mos t
circumstances”).
B. Service
The party seeking the judgment or order must serve a copy of th e
signed order or judgment on all parties within 7 days of it bein g
signed and must file proof of service with the court clerk. MCR
2.602(E)(1).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-3
=== Page 420 ===
Section 8.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
C. Correction of Judgment
The court may correct clerical mistakes in judgments or orders at an y
time, either on its own initiative, or on motion of a party. MCR
2.612(A)(1). However, MCR 7.208(A) and MCR 7.208(C) gover n
procedures for correcting errors once a claim of appeal is filed. MCR
2.612(A)(2).
Judgments or orders may be corrected nunc pro tunc (i.e.,
retroactively) when “supply[ing] an omission in the record of actio n
really had, but omitted through inadvertence or mistake.” Shifferd v
Gholston, 184 Mich App 240, 243 (1990). In Shifferd, the partie s
participated in mediation and agreed upon the mediator’s award. Id.
at 241. The plaintiff submitted a timely proposed judgment to th e
judge, but the judge did not sign it until over a month later. Id. In th e
meantime, a computer-generated dismissal was issued to the partie s
for failing to timely enter a judgment. Id. at 241-242. After failing t o
receive payment under the mediation agreement, the plaintiff sough t
to garnish the defendant’s wages. Id. at 242. The defendant moved t o
dismiss the garnishment proceedings because of the earlier orde r
dismissing the case. Id. The trial court properly held that the plaintiff
was entitled to judgment based on the mediation agreement. Id.
“An error in the admission or the exclusion of evidence, an error in a
ruling or order, or an error or defect in anything done or omitted b y
the court or by the parties is not ground for . . . disturbing a judgmen t
or order, unless refusal to take this action appears to the cour t
inconsistent with substantial justice.” MCR 2.613(A).
A judgment or order may be set aside, vacated, or stayed only by th e
judge who entered it. MCR 2.613(B). However, “[i]f the judge wh o
entered the judgment or order is absent or unable to act, an orde r
vacating or setting aside the judgment or order or stayin g
proceedings under the judgment or order may be entered by a judg e
otherwise empowered to rule in the matter.” Id.
D. Relief from Judgment
A party may seek relief from a judgment or order on the grounds se t
forth in MCR 2.612(C). See Section 4.12(C) for more information o n
setting aside a final judgment under MCR 2.612.
E. Enforcement of Judgment
“Except as provided in [MCR 2.614], execution may not issue on a
judgment and proceedings may not be taken for its enforcement until
21 days after a final judgment (as defined in MCR 7.202(6)) is entered
in the case.” MCR 2.614(A)(1). “If a motion for new trial, a motion for
Page 8-4 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 421 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.1
rehearing or reconsideration, or a motion for other relief fro m
judgment is filed and served within 21 days after entry of th e
judgment or within further time the trial court has allowed for good
cause during the 21-day period, execution may not issue on th e
judgment and proceedings may not be taken for its enforcement until
the expiration of 21 days after the entry of the order deciding th e
motion, unless otherwise ordered by the court on motion for good
cause.” Id. The court may still enjoin the transfer or disposition o f
property during the 21-day period. Id.
The statutes and court rules provide a variety of methods fo r
enforcing a judgment including installment payments, garnishment,
attachment, and judgment debtor discovery proceedings. See, e.g.,
MCL 600.6107; MCL 600.6201 et seq.; MCR 3.101; MCR 3.103; MCR
3.104.
Enforcement proceedings involving hearings include:
• proceedings on judgment debtor discovery subpoenas,
MCL 600.6110; MCR 2.621;
• requests for installment payments, MCL 600.6201 et seq.
(see also MCL 600.6107); and
2
• challenges to garnishments. MCR 3.101(K).
F. Satisfaction of Judgment
A judgment may be satisfied in whole or in part by:
• filing with the clerk a signed and acknowledged
satisfaction of judgment by the party or parties, or thei r
attorneys, in whose favor the judgment was rendered;
• for money judgments only, paying the judgment,
interest, and costs to the clerk; or
• filing a motion and having an order entered that the
3
judgment has been satisfied. MCR 2.620(1)-(3).
The clerk must indicate in the court records, in each instance, whethe r
the judgment has been satisfied in whole or in part. MCR 2.620.
2“[A] garnishee defendant is not permitted to file an objection to a writ of garnishment under the Michigan
Court Rules.” Velocity MRS Fund IV v Nextgen Pain Assoc & Rehab, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023).
3 The court must hear proofs to determine whether to enter the order. MCR 2.620.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-5
=== Page 422 ===
Section 8.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
G. Renewal of Judgment
Judgments from courts of record must be renewed after 10 years, and
judgments from courts not of record must be renewed after 6 years.
MCL 600.5809(3). The renewal can occur by ex parte motion. Van
Reken v Darden, Neef & Heitsch, 259 Mich App 454, 458 (2003).
8.2 Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV) and
New Trial
A. Generally
After a verdict in a civil case, a party may move for judgmen t
notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) under MCR 2.610, request a new
trial under MCR 2.611, or request relief under both court rules. MCR
2.610(A).
Timing. A motion under MCR 2.610 or MCR 2.611 must be filed
within 21 days after entry of a judgment. MCR 2.610(A)(1); MCR
2.611(B).
Decision. Under either court rule, “the court must give a concise
statement of the reasons for the ruling, either in a signed order o r
opinion filed in the action, or on the record.” MCR 2.610(B)(3); MCR
2.611(F).
B. Motion for JNOV Standard
A motion for JNOV should only be granted where the evidence, whe n
viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, fails t o
establish a claim as a matter of law. Wilkinson v Lee, 463 Mich 388, 391
(2000). “If reasonable jurors could have honestly reached differen t
conclusions, the jury verdict must stand.” Hecht v Nat’l Heritage
Academies, Inc, 499 Mich 586, 605-606 (2016) (alteration, quotatio n
marks, and citation omitted). A party’s motion for JNOV is properl y
denied when judgment in that party’s favor is “not required as a
matter of law based on the jury’s findings of fact[.]” Law Offices o f
Jeffrey Sherbow, PC v Fieger & Fieger, PC, 326 Mich App 684, 718 (2019),
4
rev‘d in part on other grounds 507 Mich 272 (2021).
4For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
Page 8-6 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 423 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.2
C. Failure to Timely Raise a Request for JNOV
Failure to request JNOV at the trial court renders the issu e
unpreserved for appeal. Law Offices of Jeffrey Sherbow, PC v Fieger &
Fieger, PC, 326 Mich App 684, 718 (2019), rev‘d in part on other
5
grounds _507 Mich 272 (2021). It is improper procedure for th e
defendant “to allow a civil trial to go full-term, with a jury verdic t
rendered in plaintiff’s favor and judgment entered pursuant to tha t
verdict, with no objection raised during trial to the sufficiency of th e
evidence, and then to raise a challenge to the sufficiency of th e
evidence for the first time on appeal and receive judgment in its favo r
notwithstanding the jury verdict.” Napier v Jacobs, 429 Mich 222, 230
(1987).
D. Motion for New Trial Standard
“A new trial may be granted to all or some of the parties, on all o r
some of the issues, whenever their substantial rights are materiall y
affected, for any of the following reasons:
(a) Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, o r
prevailing party, or an order of the court or abuse o f
discretion which denied the moving party a fair trial.
(b) Misconduct of the jury or of the prevailing party.
(c) Excessive or inadequate damages appearing to hav e
been influenced by passion or prejudice.
(d) A verdict clearly or grossly inadequate or excessive.
(e) A verdict or decision against the great weight of th e
evidence or contrary to law.
(f) Material evidence, newly discovered, which could
not with reasonable diligence have been discovered an d
produced at trial.
(g) Error of law occurring in the proceedings, or mistak e
of fact by the court.
(h) A ground listed in MCR 2.612 [(relief from judgmen t
6
or order)] warranting a new trial.” MCR 2.611(A)(1).
5For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see ou r
note.
6Any inquiry into the validity of a jury verdict or indictment that requires a juror’s testimony or affidavi t
must adhere to the restrictions set out in MRE 606(b).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-7

Section 8.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
A party is not entitled to a new trial unless the party proves one o f
the grounds listed in MCR 2.611(A)(1). Kelly v Builders Square, Inc, 46 5
Mich 29, 38-39 (2001) (the trial court abused its discretion in grantin g
the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial upon a finding that the jury’ s
“failure to award pain and suffering damages was ‘inconsistent’ an d
‘incongruous,’” because “MCR 2.611(A)(1) does not identify
inconsistency or incongruity as a ground for granting a new trial”).
“Under MCR 2.611(A)(1)(e), a new trial may be granted to all or some
of the parties, on all or some of the issues, whenever their substantial
rights are materially affected, for any of the following reasons: a
verdict or decision is against the great weight of the evidence o r
contrary to law.” People v Knepper, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024)
(cleaned up). “The test to determine whether a verdict is against th e
great weight of the evidence is whether the evidence preponderate s
so heavily against the verdict that it would be a miscarriage of justic e
to allow the verdict to stand.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “The hurdle that a judge must clear in order to overrule a
jury and grant a new trial is unquestionably among the highest in ou r
law.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “As a general
principle, a verdict may be vacated only when the evidence does no t
reasonably support it and it was more likely the result of cause s
outside the record, such as passion, prejudice, sympathy, or som e
other extraneous influence.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). Accordingly, “unless it can be said that directly
contradictory testimony was so far impeached that it was deprived o f
all probative value or that the jury could not believe it, or contradicted
indisputable physical facts or defied physical realities, the trial cour t
must defer to the jury’s determination.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Th e
trial court may also override the jury’s credibility determination whe n
the testimony is ‘patently incredible’ or it is ‘so inherently implausibl e
that it could not be believed by a reasonable juror, or where th e
[witness’s] testimony has been seriously impeached and the cas e
marked by uncertainties and discrepancies.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Thus, to obtain a new trial, the
defendant must establish that one of these circumstances exists, and
that there is a real concern that an innocent person may have bee n
convicted or that it would be a manifest injustice to allow the guilt y
verdict to stand.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Knepper, the “defendant challeng[ed] his conviction for attempt t o
commit CSC-I by contending that the jury verdict was against th e
great weight of the evidence.” Id. at ___. The defendant argued “tha t
the victim’s testimony was so patently implausible that it could not b e
believed by any reasonable juror,” “his theory of the case was no t
impeached, and that an extraneous influence on the jury—the victi m
asserting for the first time at trial that defendant raped her—cause d
the guilty verdict.” Id. at ___. “But defendant [failed to] identify an y
Page 8-8 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 425 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.2
specific element of the crime of conviction that he believes is negated
by inconsistent testimony.” Id. at ___. Although “defendan t
thoroughly attack[ed] the victim’s testimony about the altercation sh e
had with her father on the night in question,” he did not “explain ho w
inconsistent testimony on that issue support[ed] his argument that hi s
conviction of attempt to commit CSC-I was against the great weight o f
the evidence.” Id. at ___. “Despite the victim’s credibility issues,” “he r
testimony was [not] impeached to the point that it was deprived of all
probative value or that the jury could not believe it, or that he r
testimony contradicted indisputable physical facts or defied physical
realities.” Id. at ___. “Simply stated, the record contain[ed] ampl e
evidence to support defendant’s conviction for attempt to commi t
CSC-I, so defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of th e
great weight of the evidence.” Id. at ___. “The fact that the victim’ s
father would not have approved of his daughter engaging in sexual
acts with defendant could bear upon the victim’s credibility, but i t
[did] not negate her version of events, so the issue remain[ed] one o f
credibility.” Id. at ___ (stating that “even if defendant was correct in
claiming that the victim and her father engaged in a violen t
altercation, that does not negate the victim’s claim that defendan t
committed the offense of attempt to commit CSC-I”). “In sum,
although the evidence supporting defendant’s conviction was no t
strong, consisting primarily of the victim’s testimony which suffered
from inconsistencies and an accompanying lack of credibility, the ba r
defendant must clear to obtain relief in the form of a new trial i s
exceedingly high.” Id. at ___ (holding that defendant failed to mee t
that high standard).
“There is a distinction between the requirements of MCR
2.611(A)(1)(f) and [MCR 2.611(A)(1)(h)]”; under MCR 2.611(A)(1)(f), a
trial court may grant a new trial when the substantial rights of a part y
are substantially affected by “material evidence, newly discovered,
which could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered and
produced at trial.” Int'l Outdoor, Inc v SS Mitx, LLC, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2023) (cleaned up). In contrast, MCR 2.611(A)(1)(h) provide s
that a trial court may grant a new trial on the basis of “a ground liste d
in MCR 2.612 warranting a new trial.” Int’l Outdoor, ___ Mich App a t
___ (cleaned up). “Fraud is a ground listed in MCR 2.612 justifying
relief from a judgment, and thus falls into the category of MCR
2.611(A)(1)(h), not MCR 2.611(A)(1)(f).” Int’l Outdoor, ___ Mich Ap p
at ___ (holding that “MCR 2.612(C)(1)(c) does not impose a
requirement of due diligence upon a party seeking relief fro m
judgment on the basis of fraud, misrepresentation, or othe r
misconduct of an adverse party”).
“By its plain language, MCR 2.611(A)(1) applies only to judgment s
reached following a trial.” Rental Props Owners Ass’n of Kent Co v Kent
Co Treasurer, 308 Mich App 498, 533 (2014) (finding that the trial cour t

Section 8.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
erred by addressing the parties’ motion under MCR 2.611(A) to se t
aside a quiet title and foreclosure judgment where no trial on th e
merits was held).
On a motion for a new bench trial, the court may:
“(a) set aside the judgment if one has been entered,
(b) take additional testimony,
(c) amend findings of fact and conclusions of law, or
(d) make new findings and conclusions and direct th e
entry of a new judgment.” MCR 2.611(A)(2).
E. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision on a motion for JNOV is reviewed de novo.
Sniecinski v BCBSM, 469 Mich 124, 131 (2003).
A court’s decision whether to grant a motion for new trial under MCR
2.611 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Kelly v Builders Square,
Inc, 465 Mich 29, 34 (2001).
8.3 Remittitur and Additur
Committee Tip:
Before conducting a remittitur or additur
hearing, the court may wish to consider
submitting a case to post-verdict mediation in an
attempt to allow the parties to resolve the
judgment amount without court intervention.
A. Procedure and Timing
If the only error in the trial is that the amount of damages are eithe r
excessive or inadequate, the trial court “may deny a motion for ne w
trial on condition that within 14 days the nonmoving party consent i n
writing to the entry of judgment in an amount found by the court t o
be the lowest (if the verdict was inadequate) or highest (if the verdic t
was excessive) amount the evidence will support.” MCR 2.611(E)(1).

=== Page 427 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.3
B. Remittitur
Remittitur is the process by which an excessive jury verdict i s
reduced. Pippen v Denison Div of ABEX Corp, 66 Mich App 664, 67 4
(1976). “In determining whether remittitur is appropriate, a trial cour t
must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovin g
party and resolve whether the jury award was supported by th e
evidence.” Nelson v Beaumont Health, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025).
“An award is excessive when it exceeds ‘the usual, necessary, o r
proper limit or degree.’” Id. at ___, quoting Gilbert v DaimlerChrysler
Corp, 470 Mich 749, 763 (2004). “When a verdict is unsubstantiated b y
the record, the trial court ‘may fairly conclude that the verdict exceed s
the amount required to compensate the injured party.’” Nelson, __ _
Mich App at ___, quoting Gilbert, 470 Mich at 765. “Thi s
determination must be on the basis of objective criteria relating to th e
actual conduct of the trial and the evidence presented.” Nelson, ___
Mich App at ___.
Although the trial court may examine other factors when considerin g
remittitur, the inquiry “should be limited to objective consideration s
relating to the actual conduct of the trial or to the evidence adduced. ”
Palenkas v Beaumont Hosp, 432 Mich 527, 532 (1989). Objective factor s
to take into account when considering remittitur include:
“• whether the verdict was the result of improper
methods, prejudice, passion, partiality, sympathy ,
corruption, or mistake of law or fact;
• whether the verdict was within the limits of what
reasonable minds would deem just compensation for th e
injury sustained; and
• whether the amount actually awarded is comparable
with awards in similar cases within the state and i n
other jurisdictions.” Palenkas, 432 Mich at 532-533
(bullets added).
“In reviewing motions for remittitur, courts must be careful not t o
usurp the jury’s authority to decide what amount is necessary t o
compensate the plaintiff . . . [.]” Landin v Healthsource Saginaw, Inc, 30 5
Mich App 519, 547 (2014). “The power of remittitur should be
exercised with restraint.” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “If the jury’s award of economi c
damages falls reasonably within the range supported by the evidence,
and within the limits of what reasonable minds would deem jus t
compensation, the award should not be disturbed.” Id. at ___. “A
verdict should not be set aside merely because the method the jur y
used to compute damages cannot be ascertained.” Id. at ___. “Th e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-11
=== Page 428 ===
Section 8.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
amount awarded on remittitur must be the highest possible amoun t
the evidence will support.” Id. at ___.
If money damages awarded by a jury are grossly excessive as a matte r
of law, the judge may order remittitur, a complete new trial, or a trial
limited to the issue of damages. MCR 2.611(A)(1)(c); MCR 2.611(E)(1).
See Gilbert, 470 Mich at 763-764, for an analysis of an excessive verdic t
for which relief was permitted under MCR 2.611(A)(1)(c).
Standard of review. “A trial court’s decision regarding remittitur i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion.” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___. “A
reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable t o
the nonmoving party.” Id. at ___. “The trial court, having witnessed
the testimony and the evidence, in addition to the jury’s reactions, i s
in the best position to make an informed decision regarding th e
excessiveness of the verdict; thus, due deference should be given t o
the trial court’s decision.” Id. at ___.
C. Additur
Additur is the procedural process by which the trial court “increase s
the jury’s award of damages to avoid a new trial on grounds o f
inadequate damages.” Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed).
“The proper consideration when reviewing a grant or denial o f
additur is whether the jury award is supported by the evidence. ”
Setterington v Pontiac Gen Hosp, 223 Mich App 594, 608 (1997). “Th e
trial court’s inquiry is limited to objective considerations regardin g
the evidence adduced and the conduct of the trial.” Id.
If money damages awarded by a jury are grossly inadequate as a
matter of law, the judge may order (1) additur, (2) a complete ne w
trial, or (3) a trial limited to the issue of damages. MCR 2.611(A)(1)(c);
MCR 2.611(E)(1).
D. Standard of Review
A ruling on a motion for either remittitur or additur is reviewed fo r
an abuse of discretion. Palenkas v Beaumont Hosp, 432 Mich 527, 53 1
(1989); Hill v Sacka, 256 Mich App 443, 460 (2003).
8.4 Sanctions
“To the extent that misconduct occurs in discovery, or at any point i n
litigation, a trial court has the authority to sanction litigants and thei r
counsel.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mic h
___, ___ n 10 (2025). See also Persichini v William Beaumont Hosp, 238 Mic h
Page 8-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 429 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.5
App 626, 639 (1999) (stating that “a trial court has inherent authority t o
impose sanctions on the basis of the misconduct of a party or a n
attorney”). The trial court also has the inherent power “to control the
movement of cases on its docket by a variety of sanctions.” Id. at 640
(quotation marks and citation omitted). In addition, MCL 600.611
provides circuit courts with the “‘jurisdiction and power to make an y
order proper to fully effectuate the circuit courts’ jurisdiction and
judgments.’” Persichini, 238 Mich App at 640. A circuit court also “ha s
inherent authority to impose sanctions on litigants appearing before i t
regardless of whether the court also rules it lacks jurisdiction over a
complaint.” Meisner Law Group PC v Weston Downs Condo Ass’n, 321 Mich
App 702, 731 (2017).
A motion for sanctions should be considered timely filed if, in the trial
court’s discretion, “the motion was filed within a reasonable time afte r
the prevailing party was determined.” In re Attorney Fees and Costs, 23 3
Mich App 694, 699 (1999).
A trial court may not delegate its sanction-imposing authority to its cour t
clerks. Credit Acceptance Corp v 46th Dist Court, 481 Mich 883 (2008 )
7
(sanctions imposed under MCR 1.109 must be properly ordered by a
judge, and the court clerks’ communications to the plaintiff whe n
returning the plaintiff’s writs for noncompliance with MCR 3.101(D) did
not constitute proper court orders).
Types of sanctions include attorney fees, costs, and involuntar y
8
dismissal.
8.5 Costs
A. Authority
“Costs will be allowed to the prevailing party in an action, unles s
prohibited by statute or by these rules or unless the court direct s
otherwise, for reasons stated in writing and filed in the action.” MCR
2.625(A)(1). “The power to tax costs is wholly statutory, and th e
prevailing party cannot recover such expenses absent statutor y
authority.” Guerrero v Smith, 280 Mich App 647, 670 (2008).
7 Effective September 1, 2018, ADM File 2002-37 deleted MCR 2.114(E) that was discussed in the Credit
Acceptance Corp decision and created MCR 1.109(E), which now incorporates the rule that allows the cour t
to impose sanctions for filing documents with the court that have improper signatures. See MCR 1.109(E)
for guidance on what constitutes a proper signature.
8 See Section 8.6 on attorney fees, Section 8.5 on costs, and Section 4.10(D) on involuntary dismissal.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-13

Section 8.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
B. Rules for Determining the Prevailing Party
“If separate judgments are entered under MCR 2.116 or [MCR]
2.505(A) and the plaintiff prevails in one judgment in an amount an d
under circumstances which would entitle the plaintiff to costs, he o r
she is deemed the prevailing party. Costs common to more than on e
judgment may be allowed only once.” MCR 2.625(B)(1).
“In an action involving several issues or counts that state differen t
causes of actions or different defenses, the party prevailing on eac h
issue or count my be allowed costs for that issue or count. If there is a
single cause of action alleged, the party who prevails on the entir e
record is deemed the prevailing party.” MCR 2.625(B)(2).
“If there are several defendants in one action, and judgment for o r
dismissal of one or more of them is entered, those defendants ar e
deemed prevailing parties, even though the plaintiff ultimatel y
prevails over the remaining defendants.” MCR 2.625(B)(3).
Because the plaintiff is entitled to plead alternative claims pursuant t o
MCR 2.111(A)(2), the plaintiff needs to prevail on only one theor y
when alternative theories are pleaded to be considered the prevailin g
party. H J Tucker & Assoc, Inc v Allied Chucker & Engineering Co, 23 4
Mich App 550, 560-561 (1999).
In order to be considered the prevailing party, the party must “show a t
the very least that he improved his position by the litigation.” Ullery v
Sobie, 196 Mich App 76, 82 (1992). Similarly, “[a]n appellant in the
circuit court who improves his or her position on appeal is deemed
the prevailing party.” MCR 2.625(B)(4).
C. Procedure for Taxing Costs at the Time of Judgment
“Costs may be taxed by the court on signing the judgment, or may b e
taxed by the clerk . . . .” MCR 2.625(F)(1).
Where the trial court signs the judgment as prescribed under MCR
2.625(F)(1), a party entitled to costs is not required to file a bill of cost s
under MCR 2.625(H). J C Bldg Corp II v Parkhurst Homes, Inc, 217 Mic h
App 421, 429 (1996).
When costs are to be taxed by the clerk, the party entitled to cost s
must present a bill of costs to the clerk “within 28 days after th e
judgment is signed, or within 28 days after entry of an order denyin g
a motion for new trial, a motion to set aside the judgment, a motio n
for rehearing or reconsideration, or a motion for other postjudgmen t
9
relief except a motion under MCR 2.612(C)[.]” MCR 2.625(F)(2).
“Failure to present a bill of costs within the time prescribed
constitutes a waiver of the right to costs.” Id. A copy of the bill of cost s
Page 8-14 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 431 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.5
must be immediately served on the other party. Id. The clerk i s
required to review the bill of costs and to be “satisfied that the item s
charged in such bill are correct and legal; and shall strike out all
charges for services, which, in his judgment, were not necessary to b e
performed.” MCL 600.2461. The clerk’s action on the bill of costs i s
reviewable by the trial court on the motion of an affected party if th e
motion is filed within 7 days of notice of the taxing of costs being sent.
MCR 2.625(F)(4). Upon review, the court may only consider “thos e
affidavits or objections that were presented to the clerk[.]” Id.
Under MCR 2.625(F), “only the failure to present a bill of costs to the
clerk within the time prescribed constitutes a waiver of the right t o
costs.” Wolfenbarger v Wright, 336 Mich App 1, 31-32 (2021). While a
“failure to immediately serve the bill of costs on [the opposing party]
undoubtedly constitutes noncompliance with” MCR 2.625(F)(2), “the
failure to serve [the opposing party does not] constitute[] a failure t o
present.” Wolfenbarger, 336 Mich App at 31. “Therefore, because th e
court rule only provides for a waiver upon the failure to timel y
present the bill of costs, it should not be read to also allow for waive r
for failing to satisfy other aspects of the court rule.” Id. at 31-32
(finding the waiver provision inapplicable where plaintiffs failed t o
serve the defendant with a copy of the bill of costs but they did timel y
present the bill of costs to the clerk).
Generally, a trial court should hold an evidentiary hearing when ther e
is a challenge to the reasonableness of the costs requested. Kernen v
Homestead Dev Co, 252 Mich App 689, 691 (2002). However, if th e
parties have created a sufficient record to review the issue, a n
evidentiary hearing is not required. Id. “Absent any compelling legal
authority,“ “the trial court need not hold an evidentiary hearing if i t
can sufficiently decide an issue on the basis of evidence alread y
presented.” IGCFCO III, LLC v One Way Loans, LLC, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2024) (holding that “the trial court did not abuse its
discretion when it determined an evidentiary hearing wa s
unnecessary” because the “defendants did not present evidence tha t
might have convinced the trial court that an evidentiary hearing wa s
required” or “authority to directly support the argument that the y
[were] entitled to an evidentiary hearing”).
D. Stay of Collecting Taxed Costs
“The court or the clerk must stay the enforcement of an award taxin g
costs to a prevailing party under [MCR 2.625(F)] until expiration of
the time for filing an appeal in the appropriate appellate court, or if a n
9See Section 8.5(E) for additional information on bill of costs.

=== Page 432 ===
Section 8.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
appeal is filed, while a claim of appeal or application for leave t o
appeal in the appropriate appellate court is pending.” MCR 2.625(G).
E. Bill of Costs
Other than for fees to officers for services rendered, each item claimed
in a bill of costs must be particularly specified. MCR 2.625(H)(1). The
10
bill of costs must be supported by a verified statement, which
indicates that:
“(a) each item of cost or disbursement claimed is correc t
and has been necessarily incurred in the action, and
(b) the services for which fees have been charged wer e
actually performed.” MCR 2.625(H)(2).
Claims for witness fees must be supported with an affidavit statin g
the distance traveled and the days actually attended. MCR
2.625(H)(3). The affidavit must indicate the days the party actually
testified as a witness if the fees claimed are for a party acting as a
witness. Id.
F. Procedure for Taxing Costs and Fees After Judgment
“A judgment creditor considered a prevailing party to the actio n
under [MCR 2.625(B)] may recover from the judgment debtor(s) the
taxable costs and fees expended after a judgment is entered, includin g
all taxable filing fees, service fees, certification fees, and any othe r
costs, fees, and disbursements associated with postjudgment action s
11
as allowed by MCL 600.2405.” MCR 2.625(L)(1).
“Until the judgment is satisfied, the judgment debtor may serve o n
the judgment creditor a request to review postjudgment taxable cost s
and fees.
(a) Within 28 days of receipt from a judgment debtor o f
a request to review postjudgment taxable costs and fees,
the judgment creditor shall file with the court a
memorandum of postjudgment taxable costs and fee s
and serve the same upon the judgment debtor. A
memorandum of postjudgment taxable costs and fee s
shall include an itemized list of postjudgment taxabl e
costs and fees. The memorandum must be verified b y
oath under MCR 1.109(D)(3).
10 See MCR 1.109(D)(3) for verification requirements.
11 See Section 8.5(H) for more information on what items are allowable as costs/fees.
Page 8-16 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 433 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.5
(b) Within 28 days after receiving the memorandum o f
postjudgment taxable costs and fees from the judgmen t
creditor, the judgment debtor may file a motion t o
review postjudgment taxable costs and fees. Upo n
receipt of a timely motion, the court shall review th e
memorandum filed by the judgment creditor and issu e
an order allowing or disallowing the postjudgmen t
costs and fees. The review may be conducted at a
hearing at the court’s discretion. If the court disallow s
the postjudgment costs and fees or otherwise amend s
them in favor of the judgment debtor, the court ma y
order the judgment creditor to deduct from th e
judgment balance the amount of the motion fee paid b y
the judgment debtor under this rule.
(c) The judgment creditor shall deduct any costs or fee s
disallowed by the court within 28 days after receipt o f
an order from the court disallowing the same.
(d) Any error in adding costs or fees to the judgmen t
balance by the judgment creditor or its attorney is no t
actionable unless there is an affirmative finding by th e
court that the costs and fees were added in bad faith. ”
MCR 2.625(L)(2).
G. Attorney Fees
Unless otherwise directed, attorney fees may be taxed and awarded
12
as costs if authorized by statute or by court rule. MCL 600.2405(6).
Specific statutes and court rules that have special provisions fo r
awarding reasonable attorney fees include MCL 600.2591 (sanction s
for frivolous actions), MCR 1.109(E)(6) (sanction for signatur e
violations), and MCR 2.625(E) (costs in garnishment proceedings).
Several statutes require an award of attorney fees. See e.g., MCL
500.3148(1) (actions for overdue personal or property protectio n
insurance benefits) and MCL 600.2961 (actions for unpaid sales
commissions).
H. Fees and Expenses as Costs
Several statutes provide examples of fees that may be awarded a s
taxable costs. See e.g., MCL 600.1990; MCL 600.2405; MCL 600.2421b.
Specific examples include:
• Electronic filing system fee. MCL 600.1990.
12 See Section 8.6 for more information on attorney fees.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-17
=== Page 434 ===
Section 8.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
• Fees of individuals mentioned in MCL 600.2401 et seq. o r
MCL 600.2501 et seq., unless a contrary intention i s
stated. MCL 600.2405(1).
• Legal fees for any newspaper publication required by
law. MCL 600.2405(3).
• Attorney fees authorized by statute or court rule. MCL
600.2405(6). See also MCL 600.2421b(1)(c).
• Certified mail and federal express fees incurred to send
documents to the court clerk for filing. Vanalstine v Lan d
O’Lakes Purina Feeds, LLC, 326 Mich App 641, 655 (2018).
• Fees for deposition transcripts and certified copies of
records when filed with the clerk’s office and read int o
evidence at trial or necessarily used. MCL 600.2549. See
also Vanalstine, 326 Mich App at 655 (defendant was no t
entitled to taxable costs because the depositions wer e
not filed with the clerk’s office or read into evidence) ;
Guerrero v Smith, 280 Mich App 647, 674 (2008) (“[t]h e
costs of copying the video depositions . . . were properl y
taxed because the depositions were filed in the clerk’ s
office and used as evidence at trial”); Herrera v Levine,
176 Mich App 350, 358 (1989) (finding depositions an d
documents were not taxable because the case wa s
dismissed before the items could be used or read int o
evidence at trial). The “necessarily used” facet of th e
statutory provision allows the taxation of costs fo r
deposition transcripts submitted in support of a
successful motion for summary disposition, so long a s
the transcripts were filed in any clerk’s office. Portelli v IR
Constr Prod Co, Inc, 218 Mich App 591, 606 (1996).
Fees and expenses that are not taxable as costs include:
• Expenses incurred to enlarge exhibits;
• Traveling expenses of attorneys or parties13 ;
• Expenses related to the general copying of documents;
• Case evaluation fees;
• Expenses related to the copying of surveillance videos;
• Cost of transcripts prepared for an appeal;
13To the extent that MCL 600.2559 provides mileage may be taxed, MCL 600.2559(1) “makes clear that an y
mileage taxed under MCL 600.2559 must be related to out-of-court service of process or papers[.] ”
Vanalstine, 326 Mich App at 656 (holding that the defense attorney’s request for mileage to atten d
depositions, hearings, and court proceedings was not covered by MCL 600.2559).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.6
• Expenses related to obtaining a loan as security for an
appeal bond; and
• Expenses related to procuring a nonexpert witness’s
testimony. Van Elslander v Thomas Sebold & Assoc, Inc, 29 7
Mich App 204, 217-224 (2012); Guerrero, 280 Mich App at
671-674.
I. Standard of Review
A court’s decision whether to tax costs is reviewed for an abuse o f
discretion. Guerrero v Smith, 280 Mich App 647, 670 (2008). Whether a
particular expense is a taxable cost is a question of law that i s
reviewed de novo on appeal. Id.
“The determination whether a party is a ‘prevailing party’ for th e
purposes of awarding costs under MCR 2.625 is a question of law,”
which is reviewed de novo. Fansler v Richardson, 266 Mich App 123,
126 (2005). “When costs are denied to the prevailing party for reason s
written and filed by the court, the court’s determination should not b e
reversed on appeal unless [its] written reasons are totall y
unsupported by the facts involved in the case.” Gentris v State Farm
Mut Ins Co, 297 Mich App 354, 365 (2012) (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
8.6 Attorney Fees
“Michigan adheres to the general rule that attorney fees are no t
recoverable, either as an element of costs or as an item of damages, unles s
expressly authorized by statute, court rule, or a recognized exception. ”
Ypsilanti Charter Twp v Kircher, 281 Mich App 251, 286 (2008) (quotatio n
14
marks and citation omitted). “An attorney-client relationship must b e
established by contract before an attorney is entitled to payment fo r
services rendered.” Plunkett & Cooney, PC v Capitol Bancorp, Ltd, 212 Mic h
App 325, 329 (1995). “A party seeking such fees bears the burden of
establishing their reasonableness.” McCallum v M 97 Auto Dealer, Inc, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2025).
A. “Reasonable” Fees
To calculate a reasonable attorney fee, the court should firs t
[15]
determine “the reasonable hourly or daily rate customaril y
14One commonly-recognized exception is where the parties have contractually stipulated to the payment
of reasonable attorney fees. Pransky v Falcon Group, Inc, 311 Mich App 164, 194 (2015). See Section 8.6(F)
for information on contractual attorney fees.
15 See Section 8.6(A)(1) for more information on determining a reasonable rate.

charged in the locality for similar legal services, using reliable survey s
or other credible evidence.” Smith v Khouri, 481 Mich 519, 522 (2008).
The court should then multiply that number by “the reasonabl e
16
number of hours expended.” Id. Finally, the court may adjust the fe e
up or down after considering and indicating its view of each of th e
factors listed in Wood v DAIIE, 413 Mich 573, 588 (1982), as fine tuned
by the Smith court, and in light of Michigan Rule of Professional
Conduct 1.5(a). Smith, 481 Mich at 531. In Pirgu v United Servs Auto
Ass’n, 499 Mich 269, 281 (2016), the Michigan Supreme Court distilled
the factors from Wood and MRPC 1.5(a) into one list:
“(1) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawye r
or lawyers performing the services,
(2) the difficulty of the case, i.e., the novelty an d
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skil l
requisite to perform the legal service properly,
(3) the amount in question and the results obtained,
(4) the expenses incurred,
(5) the nature and length of the professional relationshi p
with the client,
(6) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, tha t
acceptance of the particular employment will preclud e
other employment by the lawyer,
(7) the time limitations imposed by the client or by th e
circumstances, and
(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.” Pirgu, 49 9
Mich at 281-282.
The Pirgu factors “are not exclusive, and the trial court may conside r
any additional relevant factors.” Pirgu, 499 Mich at 282. However,
“ability to pay is not a relevant consideration.” Cadwell v Highlan d
Park, 324 Mich App 642, 657 (2018) (citation omitted). “In order t o
facilitate appellate review, the trial court should briefly discuss it s
view of each of the factors . . . on the record and justify the relevanc e
and use of any additional factors.” Pirgu, 499 Mich at 282-283 (holding
that “[t]he trial court erred by not starting its analysis by multiplyin g
a reasonable hourly rate by the reasonable number of hour s
expended[ and] . . . by primarily relying on only one factor—th e
amount sought and results achieved—and failing to briefly discuss it s
view of the other factors”).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.6
“A meaningful application of the factors is more than a recitation o f
those factors prefaced by a statement such as ‘after careful review o f
the criteria the ultimate finding is as follows . . . .’ Similarly, a n
analysis is not sufficient if it consists merely of the recitation of th e
factors followed by a conclusory statement that ‘the trial court ha s
considered the factors and holds as follows . . .’ without clearl y
setting forth a substantive analysis of the factors on the record. Th e
trial court should consider the interplay between the factors and ho w
they relate to the client, the case, and even the larger lega l
community.” Augustine v Allstate Ins Co, 292 Mich App 408, 436 (2011).
The trial court abused its discretion by “not comprehensivel y
review[ing] and stat[ing] its findings with respect to all of the factor s
in the Smith/Pirgu framework, but rather focus[ing] on ‘the amount i n
question and the results obtained,’ as well as the fact that the fees a t
issue were contingency fees[.]” Powers v Brown, 328 Mich App 617,
624 (2019) (emphasis added).
Applicability of reasonable fee analysis. “[W]hether the Smith/Pirgu
framework for determining a reasonable attorney fee is applicabl e
will ‘depend on the plain language of the statute . . . at issue.’” Powers,
328 Mich App at 622, quoting Pirgu, 499 Mich at 278. “The operative
language triggering the Smith analysis is the Legislature’s instructio n
that an attorney is entitled to a reasonable fee.” Pirgu, 499 Mich at 279.
The framework for determining a reasonable attorney fee developed
in Smith and its progeny has been applied to cases involving a variet y
of court rules and fee-shifting statutes permitting the award o f
attorney fees. Kennedy v Robert Lee Auto Sales, 313 Mich App 277, 290-
293 (2015). For example, the Smith and progeny analysis has bee n
applied to cases involving:
• attorney fee determinations under the odometer
statute, MCL 257.233a(15), see McCallum v M 97 Auto
Dealer, Inc, ___ Mich App ___ (2025);
• attorney fee determinations under MCL 500.3148(1)
(actions for overdue personal or property protectio n
insurance benefits), see Pirgu, 499 Mich at 282;
• the Headlee Amendment, see Adair v State (On Third
Remand), 298 Mich App 383, 390 (2012), overruled o n
17
other grounds 494 Mich 852 (2013) ;
• the Freedom of Information Act, see Coblentz v Novi,
485 Mich 961 (2009);

Powers, 328 Mich App at 621.
Domestic relations. It is unclear if the Smith framework applies t o
attorney fees awarded in domestic relations cases under MCR
19
3.206(D)(2) , because the Court of Appeals has inconsistently applied
it in such actions. See Riemer v Johnson, 311 Mich App 632, 656-65 7
(2015) (declining to apply the Smith framework to attorney fee s
awarded under MCR 3.206(D)(2) in a custody action); Cassidy v
Cassidy, 318 Mich App 463, 489-492 (2017) (applying the Smith
framework to attorney fees awarded under MCR 3.206(D)(2) in a
divorce action).
Pro bono representation. “[P]ro bono representation is not a n
appropriate consideration in determining the reasonableness o f
attorney fees.” Woodman v Dep’t of Corrections, ___ Mich ___, __ _
(2023). Although the Court of Claims “determined that the attorney
fees were reasonable based on the hours and hourly rates provided b y
plaintiffs in support of their motion for fees but decided to reduc e
[the law firm’s] fee by 90% solely on the basis of [the law firm’s] pr o
bono representation,” the Woodman Court determined that it abused
its discretion because “pro bono representation is never a n
appropriate factor for a court to consider in determining th e
reasonableness of an attorney fee.” Id. at ___. “[W]hether an attorney
represents a client pro bono is not a valid consideration under th e
Smith/Pirgu framework because it is not relevant to the reasonablenes s
of a fee.” Woodman, ___ Mich at ___ (noting an issue of firs t
impression in Michigan).
18See also Marko Law, PLLC v Salling, ___ Mich App ___, ____, ___ (2025) (holding that “plaintiff failed t o
substantiate its claimed investigatory expenses and attorney fees with adequate proof”).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.6
1. Determining the Reasonable Hourly Rate
In the context of determining a reasonable attorney fee, “a
‘reasonable hourly rate represents the fee customarily charged i n
the locality for similar legal services, which is reflected by the
market rate for the attorney’s work.’” Van Elslander v Thomas
Sebold & Assoc, Inc, 297 Mich App 204, 233 (2012), quoting Smith
v Khouri, 481 Mich 519, 531 (2008). However, “an attorney’ s
reasonable hourly fee [is not necessarily capped] at the highes t
amount supported by the locality.” Fraser Trebilcock Davis &
Dunlap PC v Boyce Trust 2350, 304 Mich App 174, 222 (2014) (th e
trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the
attorney’s “experience and skill justified a premium rate
consistent with the 75th percentile of comparable attorneys i n
Michigan,” as opposed to the locality), rev’d in part on other
20
grounds 497 Mich 265 (2015). See also Lakeside Retreats LLC v
Camp No Counselors LLC, 340 Mich App 79, 94-95 (2022) (holding
that a billing rate “comfortably below” the 75th percentile of
comparable attorneys in the county was not unreasonable
“given the statewide mean billing rate for civil litigation, th e
fault of the [opposing party] in dragging [the case] out an d
adding to its complexity, and the above-average qualifications of
the four attorneys” who worked on the case; the trial court
properly considered the 2020 State Bar of Michigan Economic s
of Law Practice Survey in determining the customary local fee).
The fee applicant bears the burden of “produc[ing] satisfactory
evidence—in addition to the attorney’s own affidavits—that the
requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the
community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably
comparable skill, experience and reputation.” Smith, 481 Mich at
531 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The fee applican t
may support his or her request with “testimony or empirical
data found in surveys and other reliable reports.” Id. at 531-532.
See also Van Elslander, 297 Mich App at 232. One such acceptable
report may be the Economics of Law Practice Survey published
by the State Bar of Michigan. See id. at 229.
Because “[t]he market rate is the rate that lawyers of similar
ability and experience in the community normally charge their
paying clients for the type of work in question . . . the actual fee
charged, while clearly not dispositive of what constitutes a
reasonable fee, is a factor to be considered in determining
market place value as it is reflective of competition within the
community for business and typical fees demanded for similar

Section 8.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
work.” Van Elslander, 297 Mich App at 233-234 (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). In addition, a trial court may consider
other factors when determining a customary fee for similar legal
services, including:
• Referral appreciation discounts;
• Attractive rates used to entice future business;
• Familial relationships; and
• Blended fee arrangements. Van Elslander, 297 Mich
App at 234, 237.
2. Determining the Reasonable Number of Hours
Expended
To satisfy the “reasonable number of hours expended”
requirement, the fee applicant must submit detailed billing
records and evidence to support the claimed hours. Smith v
Khouri, 481 Mich 519, 532 (2008). The court must examine thes e
records for reasonableness, and the opposing party may dispute
them. Id. If there is a factual dispute, the opposing party i s
entitled to an evidentiary hearing to contest the reasonablenes s
of the hours billed or the hourly rate. Id.
“Block billing refers to the time-keeping method by which eac h
lawyer and legal assistant enters the total daily time spen t
working on a case, rather than itemizing the time expended o n
specific tasks.” Lakeside Retreats LLC v Camp No Counselors LLC,
340 Mich App 79, 95 (2022) (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). Although block billing necessarily contains som e
entries that are vague, the use of block billing to calculate the
reasonable number of hours expended on a case is not per se
improper “so long as the block-billing entries are sufficientl y
detailed to permit an analysis of what tasks were performed, the
relevance of those tasks to the litigation, and whether the
amount of time expended on those tasks was reasonable.” Id. at
98. For example, in Lakeside Retreats, block billing invoices were
detailed enough to determine the number of reasonable hours
spent on a case because the invoices were broken down by
month, staff member, and the specific tasks undertaken each
day. Id. at 98.
B. Evidentiary Hearing
Generally, when an attorney fee is requested and a party challenge s
the reasonableness of that fee, an evidentiary hearing is required, an d
the court must make findings of fact on the issue. Miller v Meijer, Inc,
Page 8-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 441 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.6
219 Mich App 476, 479-480 (1996). However, “[t]here was no error i n
failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing [on the reasonableness o f
the attorney fees] given the fact that there was a sufficient record t o
review the issue, and the court fully explained the reasons for it s
decision.” Cassidy v Cassidy, 318 Mich App 463, 492 (2017) (noting tha t
the defendant did not challenge the hourly rates, the work performed,
or the affidavits and billings submitted to the court by the plaintiff).
See also Pioneer State Mut Ins Co v Michalek, 330 Mich App 138, 150
(2019) (after failing to contest to the reasonableness of the attorne y
fees or request an evidentiary hearing in their response brief,
defendants’ request for an evidentiary hearing in their motion fo r
reconsideration was “too late to preserve the request”).
A “trial court abuse[s] its discretion when it fail[s] to hold [a n
evidentiary hearing]” where the resolution of attorney fees “involve s
an examination of many factors,” some of which are not “capable o f
being addressed without an evidentiary hearing[.]” Sabbagh v
Hamilton Psychological Servs, PLC, 329 Mich App 324, 360-361 (2019).
“[I]n relatively simple legal matters,” expert testimony is not require d
“to establish the reasonableness of attorney fees.” Zeeland Farm Svcs,
Inc v JBL Enterprises, Inc, 219 Mich App 190, 196 (1996).
C. Fees for Work of a Legal Assistant
Attorney fees may include any legal assistant’s time and labor i n
contributing “nonclerical, legal support under the supervision of a n
attorney, provided the legal assistant meets the criteria set forth i n
Article 1, § 6 of the Bylaws of the State Bar of Michigan.” MCR 2.626.
D. Settlement and Entitlement to Attorney Fees
A party cannot contest the other party’s entitlement to attorney fee s
when payment of attorney fees is part of the settlement agreement.
Kennedy v Robert Lee Auto Sales, 313 Mich App 277, 285 (2015) (holding
that where “the parties reached a settlement in which they agree d
that if they could not determine the amount of ‘statutory attorney fee s
and costs on their own,’ the trial court would decide the matter,” th e
plaintiff was entitled to an award of attorney fees in accordance wit h
the settlement agreement; “any argument that plaintiff was no t
entitled to statutory attorney fees because there was no judgmen t
against defendant [was] without merit”).
E. Self-Representation
Where there is “no agency relationship between two different people,
there [is] no lawyer-client relationship as understood in the law”;
accordingly, “a person who represents himself or herself canno t
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-25
=== Page 442 ===
Section 8.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
recover actual attorney fees even if the pro se individual is a licensed
attorney.” Omdahl v West Iron Co Bd of Ed, 478 Mich 423, 432, 432 n 4
(2007) (“both a client and an attorney are necessary ingredients for an
attorney fee award”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
In Omdahl, 478 Mich at 424, a pro se attorney-litigant sought t o
recover actual attorney fees pursuant to the Open Meetings Act.
Similarly, in Laracey v Fin Institutions Bureau, 163 Mich App 437, 446
(1987), the Michigan Court of Appeals determined that an attorne y
representing himself in an action brought under the Freedom o f
Information Act was not entitled to statutory attorney fees becaus e
“[w]here no fees were paid, no fee award is merited.”
While existing authority precludes an award of attorney fees sough t
by an attorney-litigant pursuant to a fee-shifting statute or court rule,
it is unclear if such a preclusion applies when an attorney-litigan t
seeks compensation pursuant to a contractual agreement tha t
21
provides for an attorney fee. See Bode & Grenier, LLP v Knight, 31 F
Supp 3d 111, 120 (2014), which concluded attorney fees were properl y
awarded to a law firm represented by its attorney members wher e
there was “no language in the parties’ contract which suggest[ed] tha t
the parties intended to preclude fees incurred by [the law firm] whil e
22
representing itself[.]”
F. Contract Provides for Attorney Fee
“[T]he parties to an agreement may include within the agreement a
provision respecting the payment of attorney fees, which courts will
enforce like any other term unless contrary to public policy.” Pransk y
v Falcon Group, Inc, 311 Mich App 164, 194 (2015). “[W]hen a contrac t
specifies that a breaching party is required to pay the other side’ s
attorney fees, only reasonable, not actual attorney fees should b e
awarded.” Papo v Aglo Restaurants of San Jose, Inc, 149 Mich App 285 ,
299 (1986).
“[A]ttorney fees sought under a contractual fee-shifting provision ar e
a form of general damages and, as a result, are properly considered a s
part of the amount in controversy.” ABCS Troy, LLC v Loancraft, LLC,
337 Mich App 125, 128 (2021). As such, a district court does not “err
by capping the award of contractual attorney fees” “to fit within the
court’s jurisdictional limit[.]” Id. at 141. See Section 2.3 for additional
discussion regarding the impact of contractual attorney fees o n
district court jurisdiction.
21See Section 8.6(F) for information on contractual attorney fees.
22 Decisions of lower federal courts, although they may be persuasive, are not binding on Michigan courts.
See Abela v Gen Motors Corp, 469 Mich 603, 606-607 (2004).
Page 8-26 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 443 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.6
“Because the authority to award attorney fees arises under the term s
of the agreement, the attorney fees are a type of general damages, ”
and “the party seeking payment must sue to enforce the fee-shiftin g
provision[.]” Pransky, 311 Mich App at 194. Accordingly, a trial cour t
can only award the fees as general damages on a claim brought under
the contract. Id. at 194-195 (holding that the trial court “lacked th e
authority to order [the plaintiff] to pay [the defendant]’s attorne y
fees” where the defendant “did not file a counter-claim for damage s
under the [parties’] . . . agreement”).
“‘A contractual provision for reasonable attorney fees in enforcin g
provisions of [a] contract may validly include allowance for service s
rendered upon appeal.’” Talmer Bank & Trust v Parikh, 304 Mich Ap p
373, 403 (2014), quoting Central Transp, Inc v Fruehauf, 139 Mich App
536, 549 (1984), vacated in part on other grounds Talmer Bank & Trust,
23
497 Mich 857 (2014).
Where the parties’ “contract provid[ed] that plaintiff agreed ‘t o
reimburse [defendants’] attorney fees and costs as may be fixed by th e
court,’ the parties agreed that the amount of reasonable attorney fee s
would be fixed by a court rather than a jury,” the “plaintiff waived
any right she had to a jury trial[.]” Barton-Spencer v Farm Bureau Life
Ins Co of Mich, 500 Mich 32, 34, 43 (2017) (second alteration in original )
(“[t]he Court of Appeals erred when it held that the [parties ’
agreement] was ‘ambiguous on the question whether the partie s
intended to have the reasonableness of contractual attorney fee s
decided by the trial court rather than a jury’”) (citation omitted).
Corporate bylaws constitute a contract between the parties, and a
bylaw providing for attorney fees in a particular case should b e
enforced by the court. Great Lakes Shores, Inc v Bartley, 311 Mich Ap p
252, 255 (2015) (trial court erred in not awarding attorney fee s
pursuant to the bylaws).
Michigan authority provides that the factors outlined in Smith v
Khouri, 481 Mich 519 (2008), are triggered by a statute’s “‘instructio n
that an attorney is entitled to a reasonable fee.’” Powers v Brown, 328
Mich App 617, 622 (2019), quoting Pirgu v United Servs Auto Ass’n, 499
24
Mich 269, 279 (2016). Although it appears that no case has similarly
stated the analysis for determining a reasonable attorney fee a s
contemplated in a contract, at least one case has indicated, in dicta,
that the factors outlined in Smith may be applicable. See Talmer Bank &
Trust, 304 Mich App at 403-404. See also Lakeside Retreats LLC v Cam p
No Counselors LLC, 340 Mich App 79, 93 (2022) (discussing that th e

Section 8.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
non-exclusive list of factors outlined in Smith may be considered
when determining a reasonable attorney fee, but “the starting point i s
to determine the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar
legal services” (quotation marks and citation omitted)).
G. Contingency-Fee vs. Fixed-Fee Agreements
“Where an attorney’s employment is prematurely terminated befor e
completing services contracted for under a contingency fe e
agreement, the attorney is entitled to compensation for the reasonabl e
value of his services on the basis of quantum meruit, and not on th e
basis of the contract, provided that his discharge was wrongful or hi s
withdrawal was for good cause.” Plunkett & Cooney, PC v Capitol
Bancorp, Ltd, 212 Mich App 325, 329-330 (1995). Non-exclusive factor s
the court should consider when valuing fees based on quantu m
meruit include:
“(1) the professional standing and experience of th e
attorney;
(2) the skill, time and labor involved;
(3) the amount in question and the results achieved;
(4) the difficulty of the case;
(5) the expenses incurred; and
(6) the nature and length of the professional relationshi p
with the client.” Plunkett & Cooney, PC, 212 Mich App a t
331.
However, “where the attorney is prematurely terminated,” and “ a
fixed-fee agreement exists, the value of the services that the attorne y
has agreed to render has been established.” Plunkett & Cooney, PC, 21 2
Mich App at 331. Accordingly, “in light of the client’s implicit right t o
discharge the attorney, the attorney is not entitled to recover the entir e
contract price. Instead, the attorney is entitled to recover for th e
services rendered before the discharge. The value of those service s
constitutes the percentage of the services that have been completed
pursuant to the contract, multiplied by the contract price.” Id. “It i s
inappropriate to calculate damages on the basis of quantum merui t
where a fixed-fee agreement explicitly provides the agreed-upo n
value of the services.” Id.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.6
H. Attorney’s Lien
An attorney may have a lien for his or her services. George v Sandor M
Gelman, PC, 201 Mich App 474, 476-478 (1993). In describing the type s
of attorney’s liens, the Michigan Court of Appeals has stated:
“An attorney’s lien can be one of two kinds: (1) a
general, retaining, or possessory lien, or (2) a special,
particular, or charging lien. A general or retaining lien i s
the right to retain possession of all documents, money,
or other property of the client until the fee for services i s
paid. The special or charging lien is an equitable right t o
have the fees and costs due for services secured out o f
the judgment or recovery in a particular suit.” George,
201 Mich App at 476 (internal citation omitted).
“[A]n attorneys’ charging lien for fees may not be imposed upon th e
real estate of a client, even if the attorney has successfully prosecuted
a suit to establish a client’s title or recover title or possession for th e
client, unless (1) the parties have an express agreement providing fo r
a lien, (2) the attorney obtains a judgment for the fees and follows th e
proper procedure for enforcing judgment, or (3) special equitabl e
circumstances exist to warrant imposition of a lien.” George, 201 Mic h
App at 478.
“An attorney’s lien is not enforceable against a third party unless th e
third party had actual notice of the lien, or unless circumstance s
known to the third party are such that he should have inquired as t o
the claims of the attorney.” Doxtader v Sivertsen, 183 Mich App 812,
815 (1990).
I. Referral Fees
A referral fee between lawyers who are not in the same law firm i s
only enforceable if “the client is advised of and does not object to th e
participation of all the lawyers involved” and “the total fee i s
reasonable.” MRPC 1.5(e)(1)-(2). While “an untimely objection to a
referral fee [agreement] is [not] completely irrelevant,” there must be
evidence “to prove that the clients objected to the referral-fe e
agreement at the time they were informed[.]” Babi v Herman Estate,
___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“[T]o allow subsequent events, such as a mere change of heart, t o
upset the referral arrangement is inconsistent with basic contract law,
and would be unwise as a matter of policy[.]” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, “the clients must hav e
objected at the time they were informed of the agreement in order fo r
there to be a violation of MRPC 1.5(e).” Babi, ___ Mich App at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-29
=== Page 446 ===
Section 8.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
In Babi, ___ Mich App at ___, “[a]ccording to plaintiff’s complaint,
plaintiff and [defendants] had a professional relationship wherei n
plaintiff would send [defendants] client referrals in exchange for a
referral fee.” Plaintiff referred a prospective client to defendants, and
when “the issue of an attorney’s lien asserted by plaintiff against th e
settlement proceeds” was raised, the client denied being referred b y
plaintiff to defendants, and objected to plaintiff being paid a referral
fee. Id. at ___. When plaintiff sued defendants to recover the referral
fee, defendants argued “that on the basis of [the client’s] testimon y
during the settlement hearing in which she objected to the sharing o f
the fee, any agreement between plaintiff and defendants wa s
unenforceable under MRPC 1.5(e).” Babi, ___ Mich App at ___. Th e
trial court “concluded that absent a written retainer agreement i n
which [the client] agreed to the fee, there was no genuine issue o f
material fact that [the client] objected to the fee and that no furthe r
discovery [could] reveal a different result[.]” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks omitted). Defendants eventually “produced a signed and
written copy of [the client’s] retainer agreement with defendants, i n
which she agreed that” in the event she had been referred by anothe r
attorney, defendants could pay that attorney a referral fee. Id. at ___
(noting plaintiff also “submitted evidence in the form of e-mail and
text message communications between plaintiff and defendant s
concerning plaintiff’s referral”) Thus, while the client’s “objection a t
the settlement hearing was not completely irrelevant, it was no t
sufficient to render the purported referral fee agreemen t
unenforceable under MRPC 1.5(e)”; accordingly, “the trial court erred
when it granted summary disposition in favor of defendants becaus e
discovery had not begun in earnest and it would be premature t o
grant summary disposition when discovery had a reasonable chanc e
of uncovering relevant information to plaintiff’s claim,” and als o
“erred to the extent it considered [the client’s] untimely objectio n
made four years after the referral.” Babi, ___ Mich App at ___.
J. Standard of Review
An award of attorney fees will be upheld absent an abuse of the trial
court’s discretion. Ypsilanti Charter Twp v Kircher, 281 Mich App 251,
286 (2008). “Findings of fact on which the court bases its award o f
attorney fees are reviewed for clear error.” Id.
A trial court’s decision to impose an attorney’s lien is reviewed for a n
abuse of discretion. Reynolds v Polen, 222 Mich App 20, 24 (1997). “An
abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court’s decision is outsid e
the range of reasonable and principled outcomes.” McCallum v M 97

Frivolous claim or defense. The court must award reasonable costs and
attorney fees to the prevailing party (unless the state is the prevailin g
party) against any attorney or party, or both, if it determines the claim or
defense in a civil action was frivolous. MCL 600.2591; MCL 600.2421c;
MCR 1.109(E)(7). The objective of punishing the introduction of frivolou s
claims and defenses with sanctions “is to deter parties and attorney s
from filing documents or asserting claims and defenses that have no t
been sufficiently investigated and researched or that are intended t o
serve an improper purpose.” FMB-First Mich Bank v Bailey, 232 Mich App
26
711, 722-723 (1988).
“The determination whether a claim or defense is frivolous must b e
based on the circumstances at the time it was asserted.” Pioneer State Mut
Ins Co v Michalek, 330 Mich App 138, 147 (2019) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). The evidence (or lack thereof) produced during the
proceedings may be used to evaluate whether the action was frivolous.

Section 8.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
A. Caselaw Evaluating a Motion for Frivolousness
The trial court must “articulate a clear basis for its decision ”
regarding whether a motion is frivolous. Home-Owners Ins Co v
Andriacchi, 320 Mich App 52, 79 (2017) (vacating the trial court’s orde r
and remanding for “appropriate findings” where the trial court di d
not explain its finding of frivolousness on the record and its “writte n
order gave no indication as to why it found that the motion wa s
frivolous,” even though it was “fairly apparent” from the record tha t
the motion had no legal basis). The Court of Appeals employs the
clearly erroneous standard to a trial court’s determination regardin g
the frivolousness of a pleading; accordingly, “the trial court’s failur e
to articulate a clear basis for its decision makes it impossible t o
ascertain whether the trial court clearly erred in finding the motio n
frivolous.” Id. at 75, 79.
B. Caselaw Evaluating a Claim for Frivolousness
A trial court did not “clearly err[] when it found that plaintiffs did
not bring the claims for an improper purpose” where the record als o
supported a contrary finding because the “trial court had oversee n
the proceeding for years,” “had the opportunity to view the parties i n
person,” and “was also intimately familiar with the legal argument s
and evidence.” Tolas Oil & Gas Exploration Co v Bach Servs & Mfg LLC,
347 Mich App 280, 322, 323 (2023).
The “trial court clearly erred by finding that plaintiffs’ first amende d
complaint was frivolous and warranted sanctions” because i t
“ignored the factual and legal uncertainties that plaintiffs’ attorney s
faced and the reasonable decisions they made to protect plaintiffs ’
interests.” Bauer-Rowley v Humphreys, 344 Mich App 52, 63, 64 (2022)
(noting “the circumstances presented here differ substantially fro m
cases in which [the Court of Appeals] has affirmed such sanctions”).
Specifically, the Bauer-Rowley Court held that “there was a question of
fact regarding whether plaintiffs were eligible for [persona l
protection insurance] benefits under [the plaintiff’s] policy[.] Th e
legal effect of [an order issued by the State of Michigan Department o f
Insurance and Financial Services] was also unclear considering tha t
the [Michigan Auto Insurance Placement Facility] processed claim s
for no-fault benefits in compliance with the order.” Id. at 63-64.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s order s
awarding attorney fees and costs under MCR 1.109(E) and MCL
600.2591. Id. at 64.
“Because [defendant] offered a plea in connection with MCL
333.7404, and entered probation over five weeks before plaintiff filed
the complaint for forfeiture of her vehicle, plaintiff was issuing a
demand that was then wholly without legal support, and that would
Page 8-32 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 449 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.7
have remained so even if [defendant] had later violated probation and
ended up convicted under MCL 333.7404.” In re Forfeiture of $2,124,
342 Mich App 569, 578-579 (2022) (“according to MCL
333.7521(1)(d)(iii), a violation of MCL 333.7404 did not subject her
28
vehicle to forfeiture”). Thus, “at the time plaintiff filed the forfeiture
compliant, the complaint lacked arguable legal merit to justify th e
forfeiture of [defendant’s] vehicle.” In re Forfeiture of $2,124, 342 Mic h
App at 579. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that “the trial
court clearly erred by finding that the claim was not frivolous, and
[defendant was] entitled to costs and attorney fees incurred
defending against the complaint.” Id. at 579 (citing MCL 600.2591(1)).
The trial court did not clearly err in finding that the plaintiff’s claim s
were frivolous and awarding sanctions under MCL 600.2591(3)(a)
where “there was no basis in fact to support plaintiff’s speculativ e
belief that defendant had benefited unjustly from plaintiff’s legal
advice and reached a valuable settlement with [a third party], whic h
was the foundation of plaintiff’s claims of quantum meruit, unjus t
enrichment, and fraudulent misrepresentation”; the “evidenc e
support[ed] the conclusion that plaintiff did not sufficientl y
investigate and research the factual bases of its claims,” and “a n
objective assessment of the facts known and reasonably knowable,
show[ed] that plaintiff ‘had no reasonable basis to believe that th e
facts underlying [its] legal position were in fact true[.]’” Meisner Law
Group PC v Weston Downs Condo Ass’n, 321 Mich App 702, 733, 73 4
(2017), quoting MCL 600.2591(3)(a)(ii) (internal citation omitted).
A trial court properly ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and th e
plaintiffs’ attorney where the court determined that the plaintiff s
“knew at the outset” of litigation that the claims were frivolous and
proceeded anyway. BJ’s & Sons Const Co, Inc v Van Sickle, 266 Mic h
App 400, 408 (2005).
C. Caselaw Evaluating A Defense for Frivolousness
“[T]he mere fact that a party did not ultimately prevail on its legal
position does not per se render that position frivolous[.]” Pioneer State
Mut Ins Co v Michalek, 330 Mich App 138, 147 (2019) (quotation marks,
alterations, and citation omitted). However, “the trial court did no t
clearly err in finding that defendant’s defense was frivolous,” where i t
applied a “deferential standard of review,” that included “findings
[that] went beyond a mere rejection of defendants’ legal position.” Id.
at 147 (trial court “conducted a three-day bench trial . . . , mad e
detailed findings of fact after trial, and its reference to those finding s

information on drug forfeiture laws.

Section 8.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
was sufficient to explain why it found the defense of these claims t o
be frivolous”).
For purposes of a frivolous defense that is “devoid of arguable legal
merit,” see MCL 600.2591(3)(a)(iii), devoid of arguable legal merit means
that the defense “is not sufficiently grounded in law or fact, such a s
when it violates basic, longstanding, and unmistakably eviden t
precedent.” Bronson Health Care Group, Inc v Titan Ins Co, 314 Mic h
App 577, 584-585 (2016) (holding that the trial court clearly erred i n
denying attorney fees and costs to the plaintiff pursuant to MCL
600.2591 where the defendant’s “argument regarding its liability t o
pay penalty interest under MCL 500.3142 was devoid of arguabl e
legal merit because it was contrary to basic, longstanding, and
unmistakably evident precedent”) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted).
“The plain language of [MCL 600.2591] states that costs and fees can
be awarded ‘if a court finds that a civil action or defense’ is frivolous,
and the court rule uses similar language. The statute and court rul e
do not use the phrase ‘the’ to modify the word ‘defense.’” In re Costs &
Attorney Fees (Powell Prod, Inc), 250 Mich App 89, 102 (2002) .
Therefore, “sanctions may issue if any defense is frivolous.” Id. at 103.
D. Joint and Several Liability for Sanctions
“In its traditional context, joint and several liability means that wher e
multiple tortfeasors caused a single or indivisible injury, the injured
party may either sue all tortfeasors jointly or he may sue an y
individual tortfeasor severally, and each individual tortfeasor is liabl e
for the entire judgment.” Bradley v Frye-Chaiken, ___ Mich ___, __ _
(2024) (cleaned up). However, neither MCR 1.109(E) nor MCL
600.2591(1) “require that all attorneys who represent a sanctione d
party during a civil action be held jointly responsible for frivolou s
conduct, let alone jointly and severally responsible for that conduct. ”
Bradley, ___ Mich at ___. “MCR 1.109(E)(6) only permits join t
responsibility for the party and the person who signed the frivolou s
pleading.” Bradley, ___ Mich at ___. “And while MCL 600.2591(1) i s
not explicitly dependent on the filing of a frivolous pleading, th e
statute requires more than an attorney entering an appearance durin g
any portion of the pertinent case, such as an appearance made afte r
the frivolous action or defense was dismissed on the merits, to be held
jointly responsible.” Bradley, ___ Mich at ___. “If an attorne y
substitutes into a case and does not participate in a frivolous claim o r
defense, the sanctionable conduct does not arise out of that attorney’ s
representation, and therefore a sanction is not permitted.” Id. at ___.
“MCR 1.109(E)(6) plainly does not provide that all attorneys wh o
represented a client during any portion of a case in which an action o r
Page 8-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 451 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 8.7
defense was frivolous must be held jointly and severally responsibl e
for any sanctions that are eventually imposed.” Bradley, ___ Mich a t
___. MCR 1.109(E)(6) provides that “‘[i]f a document is signed in
violation of this rule, the court, on the motion of a party or on its ow n
initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party ,
or both, an appropriate sanction . . . .’” Bradley, ___ Mich at ___,
quotingMCR 1.109(E)(6) (emphasis added). “The court rule is clea r
that only the attorney(s) who signed the frivolous document and/o r
the represented party may be held jointly responsible for the sanctio n
imposed.” Bradley, ___ Mich at ___. “The court rule does not require
the attorney who signed the frivolous document to be held jointly
responsible with the represented party for the sanction imposed.” Id. a t
___. “Rather, the court rule permits the trial court discretion to impos e
an appropriate sanction, under which a court may hold the attorne y
signing the frivolous document jointly responsible with th e
represented party for the sanctions imposed.” Id. at ___.
“MCL 600.2591 simply does not require, in any instance, tha t
attorneys must be held jointly and severally responsible for sanction s
imposed by a trial court.” Bradley, ___ Mich at ___. “MCL 600.2591
provides that ‘if a court finds that a civil action or defense to a civil
action was frivolous, the court that conducts the civil action shal l
award to the prevailing party the costs and fees incurred by that party
in connection with the civil action by assessing the costs and fee s
against the nonprevailing party and their attorney.’” Bradley, ___ Mich
at ___. “The statute clearly envisions that sanctions be awarded
against ‘the nonprevailing party and their attorney,’ but the statut e
does not require that all attorneys of record must be sanctioned,
especially when the attorney at issue was not retained when th e
frivolous ‘action or defense’ was presented or advanced.” Id. at ___.
“The Legislature chose to make a frivolous defense sanctionable.” Id.
at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “The use of ‘a’ instead
of ‘the’ supports the conclusion that the statute, as well as the cour t
rule, does not require that the entire defense or all the asserted
defenses be found frivolous in order for sanctions to issue.” Id. at ___ .
“The statute plainly contemplates that more than one frivolou s
defense may be presented during a civil action.” Id. at ___. “Had th e
statute instead referred to ‘the’ defense to a civil action, perhaps all
attorneys could be sanctioned regardless of their participation.” Id. a t
___. “Because the statute contemplates sanctions relating to a
particular defense, it follows that sanctions may only be sought
against counsel asserting that specific frivolous defense.” Id. at ___.
“The language is directed toward the claims and arguments
underlying the frivolous ‘civil action or defense,’ not all actions and
circumstances related to the case at all proceedings.” Id. at ___. “Thus,
there is no statutory basis for the assertion that all attorney s
representing the sanctioned party must themselves be sanctioned,
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 8-35
=== Page 452 ===
Section 8.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
even if an attorney did not assist with or promote the frivolou s
defense.” Id. at ___.
In Bradley, an attorney “was hired to litigate the amount of costs and
fees assessed by the trial court for frivolous defenses an d
counterclaims that were brought by attorneys prior to [the attorney’s]
appearance in the case.” Id. at ___. Notably, the attorney “did not fil e
any pleading deemed frivolous by the trial court” or “argue th e
unsubstantiated facts that formed the foundation of the trial court’ s
sanctions order.” Id. at ___. Nevertheless, the trial court held him
“jointly and severally responsible for the sanctions it had imposed on
defendant and her prior attorneys for frivolous pleadings filed earlie r
in the proceedings.” Id. at ___. “The trial court’s belief that it wa s
required to impose sanctions on [the attorney] because he was a n
attorney of record for defendant, despite that [he] neither participate d
in the relevant sanctionable conduct nor represented defendant whe n
the frivolous defenses were advanced, was not supported by MCR
1.109(E) and MCL 600.2591.” Bradley, ___ Mich at ___. “Because [th e
attorney] had not filed a frivolous document and no motion fo r
sanctions was brought against him, the court committed an error o f
law by sua sponte holding him jointly and severally responsible fo r
the sanctions imposed.” Id. at ___ (holding that “a trial court commit s
clear error by imposing sanctions against every attorney wh o
represented a sanctioned party during a civil action, even when th e
sanctionable conduct occurred prior to an attorney being retained”).
E. Self-Representation
Self-represented parties are not eligible for attorney fee sanction s
under MCR 1.109(E)(7) or MCL 600.2591 because they require
payment of “all reasonable costs actually incurred,” and a self-
represented party cannot incur attorney fees. FMB-First Mich Bank v
29
Bailey, 232 Mich App 711, 719, 726 (1998), quoting MCL 600.2591(2).
F. Standard of Review
A trial court’s finding that a claim or defense was frivolous i s
reviewed for clear error. Szymanski v Brown, 221 Mich App 423, 436
(1997).
29Effective September 1, 2018, ADM File 2002-37 deleted MCR 2.114 that was discussed in the FMB-Firs t
Michigan Bank decision, and created MCR 1.109(E)(7), which now provides for sanctions for asserting a
frivolous claim or defense.

9.1 Arbitration Under the Uniform Arbitration Act
(UAA)
A. Construct and Scope of Arbitration Agreements
Beginning July 1, 2013, statutory arbitration is governed by th e
Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA), set out at MCL 691.1681 et seq. See
2012 PA 370, repealing Michigan’s former arbitration law, MCL
600.5001 et seq. “While the UAA provides that it ‘governs a n
agreement to arbitrate whenever made,’ MCL 691.1683(1), it als o
provides that ‘[t]his act does not affect an action or proceeding
commenced . . . before this act takes effect,’ MCL 691.1713.” Fette v
Peters Constr Co, 310 Mich App 535, 542 (2015).
“An arbitration agreement is a contract by which the parties forg o
their rights to proceed in civil court in lieu of submitting their
dispute to a panel of arbitrators.” Emerzian v North Bros Ford Inc, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (citation omitted) (“An agreement t o
arbitrate is a matter of contract.”). “An agreement contained in a
record to submit to arbitration any existing or subsequen t
controversy arising between the parties to the agreement is valid,
[2]
enforceable, and irrevocable except on a ground that exists at la w
or in equity for the revocation of a contract.” MCL 691.1686(1).
“The primary task in the interpretation of a contract is to ascertai n
the intention of the parties, and, if the court determines that a n
arbitration agreement exists, whether its terms are enforceable.”
Emerzian, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “To determine whether a dispute is exclusively subject t o
arbitration, courts must first determine whether an arbitratio n
agreement has been reached by the parties.” Id. (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). “An arbitration agreement does not exis t
unless it was formed by the mutual assent of the parties.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “A party cannot be required
to arbitrate an issue which it has not agreed to submit t o
arbitration.” Id. at ___ (citation omitted). “A court determine s
whether an arbitration agreement exists by applying general
contract principles.” Id. at ___. In Emerzian, “the parties agreed tha t
plaintiff would lease a vehicle, that claims against defendant related
to the lease would be subject to arbitration, and that the lease
agreement was assigned.” Id. at ___ (“[T]he language of th e
arbitration provision in the parties’ lease agreement indicated the
parties’ agreement to permissive arbitration of the claims plaintiff
1 For information on domestic relations arbitration, see the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Domestic Violenc e
Benchbook, Chapter 7.
2 See Section 9.1(B) for more information on waiving the right to arbitrate.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.1
brought.”). Furthermore, the “defendant retained the right t o
invoke the arbitration provision in the lease agreement” “eve n
though all financial rights under the lease had been assigned,”
because “plaintiff’s claims against defendant were related to hi s
lease of the vehicle under the agreement,” and “the entir e
agreement between the parties should be considered.” Id. at ___.
The court “ascertain[s] the intent of the parties at the time they
entered into the agreement” “by examining the language of th e
agreement according to its plain and ordinary meaning.” Altobelli v
3
Hartmann, 499 Mich 284, 295 (2016). In determining the scope of a n
arbitration agreement, “a party cannot be required to arbitrate a n
issue which it has not agreed to submit to arbitration.” Id. at 29 5
(cleaned up). The party seeking to avoid the agreement bears the
burden of proof, not the party wishing to enforce the agreement. Id.
“Ascertaining the arbitrability of an issue requires a court t o
consider whether the parties’ contract contains an arbitratio n
provision, whether the disputed issue arguably comes within the
arbitration clause, and whether the dispute is expressly exempted
from arbitration by the contract.” Legacy Custom Builders v Rogers,
345 Mich App 514, 524 (2023).
“[A] court should not interpret a contract’s language beyond
determining whether arbitration applies and should not allow the
parties to divide their disputes between the court and an arbitrator.”
Ware v Meemic Ins Co, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “The reason for the rule is disput e
bifurcation defeats the efficiency of arbitration and considerably
undermines its value as an acceptable alternative to litigation, and
contract provisions that assign new roles to courts and arbitrator s
impermissibly usurp the authority of the court rules and the
arbitration statutes.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “As a result, [the Ware
Court] declined to enforce a provision that gives courts th e
authority to determine the legal effect of a contract but requires the
arbitration of damages and other factual issues.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). While “a trial court is
required to act as a gatekeeper before claims are automatically
submitted to arbitration[,] . . . the gatekeeper role of the trial cour t
relates to issues regarding arbitrability.” Id. at ___. “Thus, if a
referral to arbitration was the trial court’s first and only decision,
such would not run afoul of the [bifurcation] rule discussed.” Id. a t
___ (holding that “because the trial court decided the issue of
coverage and then referred the case to arbitration, the case wa s
effectively being bifurcated, which was improper”).
3See Section 9.1(C) regarding jurisdiction.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-3
=== Page 456 ===
Section 9.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“As a general matter, Michigan’s public policy favors arbitration.
But this general provision favoring arbitration does not go so far a s
to override foundational principles of contractual interpretation.”
Lichon v Morse, 507 Mich 424, 437 (2021) (citation omitted). The
expansion of this “application in the lower courts beyond collective
bargaining agreements to a more general rule that parties are bound
to arbitration if the disputed issue is ‘arguably’ within the
arbitration clause . . . is not a rule [that has been] adopted outsid e
the context of collective bargaining agreements[.]” Id. at 438. The
“general practice of looking to federal precedent discussing the
[National Labor Relations Act] to interpret the [state’s Publi c
Employment Relations Act (PERA), MCL 423.201 et seq.] is simply
inapplicable [where] the PERA is not at issue.” Lichon, 507 Mich a t
438. “If litigating parties have an employment or other contractual
relationship, one party will likely be able to find some factual
connection, however remote, between their dispute and the
relationship. But we require more than the barest factual connectio n
for a claim to be relative to employment or another pertinen t
contractual relationship. In determining whether a claim is relative
to employment, we adopt the approach that asks if the action could
be maintained without reference to the contract or relationship a t
issue.” Id. at 440 (cleaned up).
The Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA) “does not apply to a n
arbitration between members of a voluntary membership
organization if arbitration is required and administered by the
organization.” MCL 691.1683(2). “However, a party to such a n
arbitration may request a court to enter an order confirming a n
arbitration award and the court may confirm the award or vacate
the award for a reason contained in [MCL 691.1703(1)(a), MCL
691.1703(1)(b), or MCL 691.1703(1)(d)].” MCL 691.1683(2).
B. Waiver of Requirements or Restriction of Rights Under
Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA)
1. Authority to Waive or Alter Requirements
[4]
“Except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (3) , a
party to an agreement to arbitrate or to an arbitratio n
proceeding may waive or the parties may vary the effect of th e
requirements of this act to the extent permitted by law.” MCL
691.1684(1). Waiver of the right to arbitrate may be either
express or implied. Nexteer Auto Corp v Mando America Corp,
314 Mich App 391, 395 (2016).
4 Both provisions prohibit the waiver of certain requirements or restriction of certain rights contained in
the Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA).
Page 9-4 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 457 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.1
Waiver of a contractual right to arbitration is not favored.
Nexteer, 314 Mich App at 395. “The party arguing there ha s
been a waiver of [the right to arbitration] bears a heavy burde n
of proof and must demonstrate knowledge of an existing righ t
to compel arbitration, acts inconsistent with the right t o
arbitrate, and prejudice resulting from the inconsistent acts. ”
Id. at 397 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “However,
where there is an express waiver, the party seeking to enforc e
the waiver need not show prejudice.” Id. (finding an expres s
waiver where the party stipulated in a case management orde r
that the arbitration provision in the arbitration agreement di d
not apply to the dispute).
Whether the relevant circumstances establish a waiver of th e
right to arbitration is a question of law that is reviewed d e
novo, and the trial court’s factual determinations regarding th e
applicable circumstances are reviewed for clear error. Madiso n
Dist Pub Sch v Myers, 247 Mich App 583, 588 (2001).
2. Prohibited Waivers or Restrictions
“Before a controversy arises that is subject to an agreement t o
arbitrate, a party to the agreement may not do any of th e
following:
(a) Waive or agree to vary the effect of the
requirements of [MCL 691.1685(1), MCL
691.1686(1), MCL 691.1688, MCL 691.1697(1), MCL
691.1697(2), MCL 691.1706, or MCL 691.1708].
(b) Agree to unreasonably restrict the right under
[MCL 691.1689] to notice of the initiation of a n
arbitration proceeding.
(c) Agree to unreasonably restrict the right under
[MCL 691.1692] to disclosure of any facts by a
neutral arbitrator.
(d) Waive the right under [MCL 691.1696] of a
party to an agreement to arbitrate to be
represented by a lawyer at any proceeding or
hearing under this act, but an employer and a labor
organization may waive the right to representatio n
by a lawyer in a labor arbitration.” MCL
691.1684(2).
In addition, under MCL 691.1684(3), “[a] party to an agreemen t
to arbitrate or arbitration proceeding may not waive, or th e
parties may not vary the effect of, the requirements of [MCL

691.1687, MCL 691.1694, MCL 691.1698, MCL 691.1700(4) or
MCL 691.1700(5), MCL 691.1702, MCL 691.1703, MCL
691.1704, MCL 691.1705(1) or MCL 691.1705(2), MCL 691.1709,
MCL 691.1710, or MCL 691.1711].”
C. Jurisdiction: Courts and Arbitrators
“An agreement to arbitrate that provides for arbitration in this state
confers exclusive jurisdiction on the court to enter judgment on a n
award under [the Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA)].” MCL
691.1706(2). “A court of this state that has jurisdiction over th e
controversy and the parties may enforce an agreement to arbitrate.”
MCL 691.1706(1).
Judges and arbitrators have different roles in reviewing arbitratio n
agreements: “The court shall decide whether an agreement t o
arbitrate exists or a controversy is subject to an agreement t o
arbitrate” whereas “[a]n arbitrator shall decide whether a conditio n
precedent to arbitrability has been fulfilled and whether a contrac t
6
containing a valid agreement to arbitrate is enforceable.” MCL
691.1686(2)-(3). See also Registered Nurses, Registered Pharmacists
Union v Hurley Med Ctr, 328 Mich App 528 (2019). “To ascertain th e
arbitrability of an issue, the court must consider whether there is a n
arbitration provision in the parties’ contract, whether the disputed
issue is arguably within the arbitration clause, and whether the
dispute is expressly exempt from arbitration by the terms of the
contract.” Registered Nurses, Registered Pharmacists Union, 328 Mich
App at 531, 536 (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Whether a contract to arbitrate has terminated is a question to be
decided by the courts, not by the arbitrator. 36th Dist Court v Mich
AFSCME Council 25, 295 Mich App 502, 515 (2012), rev’d in part, l v
7
den in part 493 Mich 879 (2012). Additionally, “the issue of whethe r
a party breached a [collective bargaining agreement] involves the
interpretation of a contract, which is a question of law that i s
decided by a court.” Registered Nurses, Registered Pharmacists Union,
328 Mich App at 531.
“If a party to a judicial proceeding challenges the existence of, or
claims that a controversy is not subject to, an agreement to arbitrate,
5MCL 691.1684 refers to “section 3(1) or (3)”; however, there is no subsection (3) in MCL 691.1683.
6 Detailed discussion of the arbitrator’s role and the actual arbitration proceeding is beyond the scope o f
this benchbook. Those topics will only be addressed in the context of judicial review of the arbitrator’ s
actions or decisions.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.1
the arbitration proceeding may continue pending final resolution of
the issue by the court, unless the court otherwise orders.” MCL
691.1686(4).
D. Request for Judicial Relief
In order to receive judicial relief under the Uniform Arbitration Ac t
(UAA), a party must request it:
8
“Except as otherwise provided in [MCL 691.1708 ], a
request for judicial relief under this act must be made by
motion to the court and heard in the manner provided
by court rule for making and hearing motions.” MCL
691.1685(1).
“Unless a civil action is already pending between the parties, a
complaint regarding the agreement to arbitrate must be filed and
served as in other civil actions.” MCL 691.1685(2). “Notice of an
initial motion under this act may be served with the summons and
complaint in the manner provided by court rule for the service of a
summons in a civil action.” Id. “Otherwise, notice of the motio n
must be given in the manner provided by court rule for serving
motions in pending actions.” Id.
“A motion under [MCL 691.1685] shall be made in the court of th e
county in which the agreement to arbitrate specifies the arbitratio n
hearing is to be held or, if the hearing has been held, in the court of
the county in which it was held.” MCL 691.1707. “Otherwise, the
motion may be made in the court of any county in which an adverse
party resides or has a place of business or, if no adverse party has a
residence or place of business in this state, in the court of any county
in this state.” Id. “All subsequent motions shall be made in the cour t
that heard the initial motion unless the court otherwise directs.” Id.
E. Specific Motions Heard by Court
1. Generally
“If a proceeding involving a claim referable to arbitratio n
under an alleged agreement to arbitrate is pending in court, a
motion under this section [to compel or stay arbitration] mus t
be made in that court. Otherwise a motion under this sectio n
9
may be made in any court as provided in [MCL 691.1707 ].”
MCL 691.1687(5).
8 MCL 691.1708 governs appeals of decisions made under the UAA.
9 See Section 9.1(D) for more information on MCL 691.1707.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-7
=== Page 460 ===
Section 9.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
If a party motions the court to order arbitration, “the court o n
just terms shall stay any judicial proceeding that involves a
claim alleged to be subject to the arbitration until the cour t
renders a final decision under this section.” MCL 691.1687(6).
If the court ultimately orders arbitration, “the court on jus t
terms shall stay any judicial proceeding that involves a clai m
subject to the arbitration.” MCL 691.1687(7). “If a claim subjec t
to the arbitration is severable, the court may limit the stay t o
that claim.” Id.; see also MCR 3.602(C) (requiring a stay in an
action involving an issue subject to arbitration if an order fo r
arbitration or a motion for such an order has been made).
Accordingly, the trial court erred when it summarily dismissed
a lien foreclosure claim even though it correctly enforced th e
arbitration agreement because the Uniform Arbitration Ac t
(UAA) and Michigan Court Rules require the court to stay th e
lawsuit pending arbitration. Legacy Custom Builders v Rogers,
345 Mich App 514, 526 (2023) (citing MCL 691.1687(6), MCL
691.1687(7), and MCR 3.602(C)). In Legacy, the Court of
Appeals observed that “[h]ad the trial court stayed the lawsui t
pending arbitration, instead of dismissing, it would hav e
enforced the arbitration agreement while protectin g
[plaintiff’s] compliance with the limitations period and abilit y
to enforce the lien after arbitration.” Legacy, 345 Mich App at
526-527. See also Nucast, LLC v Livonia Pre Cast LLC, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2025) (remanding to “the trial court to enter a n
order staying the proceedings pending arbitration” pursuan t
to MCL 691.1687(7) and MCR 3.602(C), and Legacy, 345 Mic h
App at 526-530).
“The court shall not refuse to order arbitration because th e
claim subject to arbitration lacks merit or grounds for the clai m
have not been established.” MCL 691.1687(4).
2. Other Party Refuses to Arbitrate
Where a party’s motion shows an arbitration agreement an d
alleges that another party refuses to arbitrate as agreed, th e
court must do the following:
“(a) If the refusing party does not appear or doe s
not oppose the motion, order the parties t o
arbitrate.
(b) If the refusing party opposes the motion,
proceed summarily to decide the issue and order
the parties to arbitrate unless it finds that there i s
no enforceable agreement to arbitrate.” MCL
691.1687(1).
Page 9-8 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 461 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.1
The court must not order the parties to arbitrate under MCL
691.1687(1) if it determines there is no enforceable arbitratio n
agreement. MCL 691.1687(3).
3. No Arbitration Agreement Exists
Where a party motions the court and alleges “that a n
arbitration proceeding has been initiated or threatened but tha t
there is no agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed
summarily to decide the issue.” MCL 691.1687(2). If the cour t
finds that an enforceable arbitration agreement exists, it mus t
order the parties to arbitrate. Id. The court must not order the
parties to arbitrate under MCL 691.1687(2) if it determine s
there is no enforceable arbitration agreement. MCL
691.1687(3).
4. Provisional Remedies
Two situations exist where, upon motion of a party, the cour t
may enter an order “for provisional remedies to protect th e
effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding to the same exten t
and under the same conditions as if the controversy were th e
subject of a civil action”:
• before an arbitrator has been appointed and
authorized to act under the UAA, for good cause
shown, MCL 691.1688(1); or
• after an arbitrator has been appointed and authorized
to act under the UAA “only if the matter is urgen t
and the arbitrator is not able to act timely or the
arbitrator cannot provide an adequate remedy.” MCL
691.1688(2)(a)-(b). The provisional remedy under
MCL 691.1688(2)(a) may include interim awards and
may also be issued to “promote the fair and
expeditious resolution of the controversy[.]” Id.
“A party does not waive a right of arbitration by making a
motion under [MCL 691.1688(1)-(2)].” MCL 691.1688(3).
5. Appointment of Arbitrator
On motion of a party to the arbitration proceeding, the court
must appoint an arbitrator when the parties have not agreed
on a method for appointing an arbitrator, the agreed upo n
method fails, or an appointed arbitrator fails or is unable to ac t
and a successor has not been appointed. MCL 691.1691(1). A n
arbitrator appointed by the court “has all the powers of a n
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-9
=== Page 462 ===
Section 9.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
arbitrator designated in the agreement to arbitrate or a n
arbitrator appointed by the agreed method.” Id.
6. Consolidation of Separate Arbitration Proceedings
Unless the arbitration agreement prohibits the consolidation o f
claims, see MCL 691.1690(3), upon the motion of a party to the
arbitration agreement, the court “may order consolidation of
separate arbitration proceedings as to all or some of th e
[10]
claims if all of the following apply:
(a) There are separate agreements to arbitrate or
separate arbitration proceedings between the same
persons or 1 of them is a party to a separat e
agreement to arbitrate or a separate arbitratio n
proceeding with a third person.
(b) The claims subject to the agreements t o
arbitrate arise in substantial part from the same
transaction or series of related transactions.
(c) The existence of a common issue of law or fac t
creates the possibility of conflicting decisions i n
the separate arbitration proceedings.
(d) Prejudice resulting from a failure to consolidate
is not outweighed by the risk of undue delay or
prejudice to the rights of or hardship to partie s
opposing consolidation.” MCL 691.1690(1).
7. Motions to Enforce Witness Attendance and Out-of-
State Subpoena or Discovery Order
On motion by a party or the arbitrator, “[a] court may enforce a
subpoena or discovery-related order for the attendance of a
witness in this state and for the production of records an d
other evidence issued by an arbitrator in connection with a n
arbitration proceeding in another state on condition s
determined by the court so as to make the arbitratio n
proceeding fair, expeditious, and cost effective.” MCL
691.1697(7). An out-of-state subpoena or discovery-related
order must be served and enforced in the manner provided by
law for service and enforcement of subpoenas in a civil actio n
11
in Michigan. Id.
10 See also MCL 691.1690(2), which permits the court to “order consolidation of separate arbitration
proceedings as to some claims and allow other claims to be resolved in separate arbitration proceedings.”
11See Section 5.3(C) for information on subpoenas and Section 5.6 for information on foreign subpoenas.

8. Expedited Order to Confirm Award
Under MCL 691.1698(1), after receiving a preaward ruling and
requesting that the ruling be incorporated into an award, “[a ]
prevailing party may move the court for an expedited order t o
confirm the award under [MCL 691.1702], in which case the
court shall summarily decide the motion. The court shall issu e
an order to confirm the award unless the court vacates,
modifies, or corrects the award under [MCL 691.1703 or MCL
12
691.1704 ].”
9. Review of Arbitrator’s Award
“Judicial review of an arbitrator’s decision is narrowl y
circumscribed.” Mich Dept of State Police v Mich State Police
Troopers Ass’n, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). Every error of law committed by an
arbitrator does not merit subsequent court intervention. TSP
Servs, Inc v Nat’l-Std, LLC, 329 Mich App 615, 620 (2019). “A
reviewing court has three options when a party challenges a n
arbitration award: (1) confirm the award, (2) vacate the award
if obtained through fraud, duress, or other undue means, or (3 )
modify the award or correct errors that are apparent on th e
face of the award.” Krist v Krist, 246 Mich App 59, 67 (2001). See
also MCL 691.1702; MCL 691.1703; MCL 691.1704; Mich State
Police Troopers, ___ Mich App at ___ (“[a] court may also review
an arbitrator’s award for an error of law that clearly appears o n
the face of the award or in the reasons stated by the arbitrato r
for the decision”).
“A court may not review an arbitrator’s factual findings o r
decision on the merits or engage in contract interpretation. ”
Mich Dep’t of State Police, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). “A reviewing court may not substitute
its judgment for that of the arbitrator, and instead may onl y
decide whether the arbitrator’s award draws its essence fro m
the contract.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“If the arbitrator in granting the award did not disregard th e
terms of his employment and the scope of his authority a s
expressly circumscribed in the contract, judicial revie w
effectively ceases.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted).
“[I]n determining whether there is legal error, the court canno t
engage in a review of an arbitrator’s mental process, bu t
instead must review the face of the award itself[.]” TSP, 329
12 See Section 9.1(E)(9)(a) for more information on confirming an arbitrator’s award.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-11
=== Page 464 ===
Section 9.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Mich App at 620 (2019) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted). “The error must be so material or so substantial as t o
have governed the award, and but for which the award woul d
have been substantially otherwise.” Mich Dep’t of State Police,
___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Except with respect to awarding punitive damages or othe r
exemplary relief under MCL 691.1701(1) or reasonabl e
attorney fees and other reasonable expenses under MCL
691.1701(2), an arbitrator has the authority to “order remedie s
that the arbitrator considers just and appropriate under th e
circumstances of the arbitration proceeding” as part of a n
award. MCL 691.1701(3). “The fact that such a remedy could
not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground fo r
refusing to confirm an award under MCL 691.1702 or for
vacating an award under section MCL 691.1703.” MCL
691.1701(3).
a. Confirmation of Award
“After a party to an arbitration proceeding receives notice
of an award, the party may move the court for an orde r
confirming the award at which time the court shall issue a
confirming order unless the award is modified or
corrected under [MCL 691.1700 or MCL 691.1704] or is
vacated under [MCL 691.1703].” MCL 691.1702. Se e
Section 9.1(E)(9)(c) for information on modifying or
correcting an award.
b. Vacating Award
“On motion to the court by a party to an arbitratio n
proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in the
arbitration proceeding if any of the following apply:
(a) The award was procured by corruption,
fraud, or other undue means.
(b) There was any of the following:
(i) Evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator.
(ii) Corruption by an arbitrator.
(iii) Misconduct by an arbitrato r
prejudicing the rights of a party to the
arbitration proceeding.
Page 9-12 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 465 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.1
(c) An arbitrator refused to postpone th e
hearing upon showing of sufficient cause fo r
postponement, refused to consider evidenc e
material to the controversy, or otherwis e
conducted the hearing contrary to [MCL
691.1695], so as to prejudice substantially the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding.
(d) An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator’ s
powers.
(e) There was no agreement to arbitrate,
unless the person participated in th e
arbitration proceeding without raising th e
objection under [MCL 691.1695(3)] not late r
than the beginning of the arbitration hearing.
(f) The arbitration was conducted withou t
proper notice of the initiation of an arbitratio n
as required in [MCL 691.1689] so as to
prejudice substantially the rights of a party t o
the arbitration proceeding.” MCL 691.1703(1).
Timing. “A motion under [MCL 691.1703] must be filed
within 90 days after the moving party receives notice of
the award under [MCL 691.1699] or within 90 days after
the moving party receives notice of a modified or
corrected award under [MCL 691.1700], unless the
moving party alleges that the award was procured by
corruption, fraud, or other undue means, in which case
the motion must be made within 90 days after the ground
is known or by the exercise of reasonable care would have
been known by the moving party.” MCL 691.1703(2).
Arbitrator’s Powers. “Arbitrators must abide by the term s
and conditions that grant them jurisdiction and authority
to resolve a dispute.” Mich Dept of State Police v Mich State
Police Troopers Ass’n, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023).
“Arbitrators can fairly be said to exceed their power
whenever they act beyond the material terms of the
contract from which they primarily draw their authority,
or in contravention of controlling principles of law.” Id. at
___ (cleaned up). “An arbitrator may not act on his ow n
sense of personal justice, but is confined to interpretatio n
and application of the agreement.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
“An arbitrator who refuses to abide by the terms of a n
agreement exceeds the limits upon which the contractual
submission is based, exceeds the consensual authority
bestowed upon him by the contract, and the award
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-13
=== Page 466 ===
Section 9.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
resulting therefrom is without legal sanction.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Although the
judicial policy favoring labor arbitration warrants a
strong presumption in favor of enforcing arbitral awards,
an award is properly vacated when that award i s
dependent upon . . . an arbitrator’s disregard and
contravention of provisions expressly limiting arbitral
authority.” Id. at ___ (citation omitted). Accordingly ,
where a collective bargaining agreement gives the
arbitrator “the power to determine whether an employee
was discharged without just cause,” and the “arbitrator
concluded the grievant was discharged without good
cause and instead determined that unpaid suspensio n
was proper,” the trial court “erred by vacating the
arbitrator’s award.” Id. at ___ (noting that although a
police trooper’s behavior might tarnish the reputation of
the Michigan Department of State Police, it “is not the
type of ‘well defined and dominant’ public policy
violation that would warrant overturning the arbitrator’ s
ruling.”)
It is not within an arbitrator’s powers to order alimony
(absent a showing of fraud) in a divorce case where the
parties have already agreed that it would not be awarded
and would be forever barred. Krist v Krist, 246 Mich App
59, 62-65 (2001) (finding, however, that the arbitrator did
not exceed his authority because his award wa s
determined to be a division of marital property rather
than an award of alimony).
Where the terms of the arbitration agreement limited the
scope of arbitration to the issues raised in the pleadings,
the arbitrator did not exceed his powers in rendering a n
award based on an issue in the defendant’s counter-
complaint even though the issue was not addressed in the
parties’ arbitration summaries. Nordlund & Assoc, Inc v
Hesperia, 288 Mich App 222, 229 (2010). The Michiga n
Court of Appeals concluded that whether the issue wa s
raised in the arbitration summaries was irrelevant t o
determining whether the arbitrator exceeded the scope of
his powers granted by the terms of the arbitratio n
agreement. Id.
Rehearing. “If the court vacates an award on a ground
other than that set forth in [MCL 691.1703(1)(e)], it ma y
order a rehearing.” MCL 691.1703(3). “If the award i s
vacated on a ground stated in [MCL 691.1703(1)(a)] or
[MCL 691.1703(1)(b)], the rehearing shall be before a ne w
arbitrator.” MCL 691.1703(3). “If the award is vacated on a
Page 9-14 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 467 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.1
ground stated in [MCL 691.1703(1)(c), MCL
691.1703(1)(d), or MCL 691.1703(1)(f)], the rehearing may
be before the arbitrator who made the award or the
arbitrator’s successor.” MCL 691.1703(3). “The arbitrator
shall render the decision in the rehearing within the same
time as that provided in [MCL 691.1699(2)] for an award.”
MCL 691.1703(3). However, the court may not return th e
matter to the arbitrator for an expansion of the record.
Saveski v Tiseo Architects, Inc, 261 Mich App 553, 55 8
(2004).
Arbitrator Partiality, Corruption, or Misconduct. Upon
timely objection by a party, a court may vacate an award
on the grounds of partiality, corruption, or misconduct by
the arbitrator, see MCL 691.1703(1)(b), if the arbitrato r
fails to make certain required disclosures under MCL
691.1692(1)-(2). MCL 691.1692(4). Failure to “disclose a
known, direct, and material interest in the outcome of th e
arbitration proceeding or a known, existing, and
substantial relationship with a party is presumed to ac t
with evident partiality under [MCL 691.1703(1)(b)].”
MCL 691.1692(5).
If the parties agree to an arbitration organization’ s
procedures or to procedures for challenging the arbitrator
before an award is made, “substantial compliance wit h
those procedures is a condition precedent to a motion t o
vacate an award on that ground under [MCL
691.1703(1)(b)].” MCL 691.1692(6).
Error of Law. “A reviewing court may vacate an
arbitration award where it finds an error of law that i s
apparent on its face and so substantial that, but for the
error, the award would have been substantially different.”
Collins v BCBSM, 228 Mich App 560, 567 (1998). Se e
generally MCL 691.1703(1)(c).
Denial of Motion to Vacate. “If the court denies a motio n
to vacate an award, it shall confirm the award unless a
motion to modify or correct the award is pending.” MCL
691.1703(4).
c. Modification or Correction of Award
“On motion made within 90 days after the moving party
receives notice of the award under [MCL 691.1699] or
within 90 days after the moving party receives notice of a
modified or corrected award under [MCL 691.1700], the
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-15
=== Page 468 ===
Section 9.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
court shall modify or correct the award if any of th e
following apply:
(a) There was an evident mathematica l
miscalculation or an evident mistake in th e
description of a person, thing, or property
referred to in the award.
(b) The arbitrator has made an award on a
claim not submitted to the arbitrator and th e
award may be corrected without affecting th e
merits of the decision on the claim s
submitted.
(c) The award is imperfect in a matter of for m
not affecting the merits of the decision on th e
claims submitted.” MCL 691.1704(1).
“If a motion made under [MCL 691.1704(1)] is granted,
the court shall modify or correct and confirm the award
as modified or corrected.” MCL 691.1704(2). “Otherwise,
unless a motion to vacate is pending, the court shall
confirm the award.” Id.
“A motion to modify or correct an award under [MCL
691.1704] may be joined with a motion to vacate th e
award.” MCL 691.1704(3).
10. Judgment on Award
An arbitration agreement “that provides for arbitration in thi s
state confers exclusive jurisdiction on the court to ente r
judgment on an award under [the UAA].” MCL 691.1706(2).
See Section 9.1(C) for more information on jurisdiction.
“On granting an order confirming, vacating without directin g
a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award, the court shal l
enter a judgment that conforms with the order.” MCL
691.1705(1). “The judgment may be recorded, docketed, and
enforced as any other judgment in a civil action.” Id.
“A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion and
subsequent judicial proceedings.” MCL 691.1705(2). “O n
request of a prevailing party to a contested judicial proceedin g
under [MCL 691.1702, MCL 691.1703, or MCL 691.1704], the
court may add reasonable attorney fees and other reasonabl e
expenses of litigation incurred in a judicial proceeding after th e
award is made to a judgment confirming, vacating withou t
directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award. ”
MCL 691.1705(3).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.1
F. Civil Immunity and Competency to Testify for Arbitrator,
Arbitration Organization, or Arbitration Organization
Representative
“An arbitrator or an arbitration organization acting in that capacity
is immune from civil liability to the same extent as a judge of a cour t
of this state acting in a judicial capacity.” MCL 691.1694(1). This civil
immunity “supplements any immunity under other law.” MCL
691.1694(2).
An arbitrator does not lose his or her civil immunity for failing t o
“disclose to all parties to the agreement to arbitrate and arbitratio n
proceeding and to any other arbitrators any known facts [or any
facts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointment] that a
reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of
13
the arbitrator[.]” MCL 691.1692(1)-(2); MCL 691.1694(3).
In judicial, administrative, or similar proceedings, arbitrators and
arbitration organization representatives are “not competent t o
testify, and may not be required to produce records as to any
statement, conduct, decision, or ruling occurring during the
arbitration proceeding, to the same extent as a judge of a court of
this state acting in a judicial capacity.” MCL 691.1694(4). The “plain
language of the statute prohibits compelling arbitrators from givin g
any factual evidence as a witness regarding any statements,
conduct, decisions, or rulings that [they] may have made during th e
arbitration proceeding.” Elder v Gordon, 343 Mich App 388, 392
(2022) (holding that while the “arbitrator could have been asked t o
clarify the factual question at issue in [the] case before the
arbitration award was finalized and that underlying case wa s
dismissed,” “to ask the arbitrator a factual question [after], in a
separate proceeding, would violate MCL 691.1694(4)”).
However, MCL 691.1694(4) does not apply in the following
situations:
• “to the extent necessary to determine the claim of a n
arbitrator, arbitration organization, or representative
of the arbitration organization against a party to the
arbitration proceeding,” MCL 691.1694(4)(a);
• “to a hearing on a motion to vacate an award under
[MCL 691.1703(1)(b) or MCL 691.1703(1)(c)] if th e
moving party establishes prima facie that a ground
for vacating the award exists,” MCL 691.1694(4)(b).
13 Note, however, that on timely objection by a party, the court may vacate an award if the arbitrator fails
to make the required disclosures under MCL 691.1692(1)-(2). MCL 691.1692(4). See Section 9.1(E)(9)(b) for
information on vacating an award.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-17

Section 9.1 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
The court must award an arbitrator, arbitration organization, or
arbitration organization representative “reasonable attorney fee s
and other reasonable expenses of litigation” in the following
circumstances:
• if an individual commences a civil action against th e
arbitrator, organization, or representative that arise s
from their services, or if a person seeks to compel a n
arbitrator or representative to testify or produce
records in violation of MCL 691.1694(4), and
• the court determines that the arbitrator, organization,
or representative has civil immunity or that the
arbitrator or representative is not competent to testify.
MCL 691.1694(5).
G. Appeals
The Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA) “generally establishes a n
appeal of right.” Nucast, LLC v Livonia Pre Cast LLC, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2025) (noting “the UAA’s jurisdictional grant specifically
lists the judgments and orders from which parties may appeal as of
right for arbitration matters”).
“An appeal may be taken from any of the following:
(a) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration.
(b) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration.
(c) An order confirming or denying confirmation of a n
award.
(d) An order modifying or correcting an award.
(e) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing.
(f) A final judgment entered under this act.” MCL
691.1708(1).
“An appeal under [MCL 691.1708] shall be taken as from an order or
a judgment in a civil action.” MCL 691.1708(2).
In Nucast, “defendants attempt[ed] to appeal as of right a stipulated
order dismissing the case in light of the parties’ agreement t o
arbitrate.” Nucast, ___ Mich App at ___. “Because the order
dismissed all the remaining claims without prejudice, however, it di d
not resolve the merits of those claims, such that they [were] no t
barred from being resurrected on that docket at some future date.”
Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Indeed, partie s
Page 9-18 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 471 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.2
cannot create a final order by stipulating the dismissal of remaining
claims without prejudice after a trial court enters an order denying a
motion for summary disposition addressing only some of the
parties’ claims.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “What is more, th e
stipulated order expressly allowed the parties to move to reopen the
case for entry of an arbitration award, which is akin to the trial cour t
retaining jurisdiction.” Id. at ___. “That the order included languag e
to the contrary—i.e., that it was final, resolved all pending claims,
and closed the case—is of no consequence, because such language i s
not dispositive and does not control [the Court of Appeals’]
jurisdiction.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citations omitted).
Instead, the Court of Appeals is “charged with examining both the
content and effect of the order.” Id. at ___ (concluding that “the
order appealed was not final because it did not resolve the merits of
the remaining claims and allowed the parties to reopen the case t o
enforce the arbitration award issued pursuant to the parties’
agreement to arbitrate”).
H. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision to enforce, vacate, or modify a statutory
arbitration award is reviewed de novo. Tokar v Albery, 258 Mich App
350, 352 (2003).
9.2 Arbitration Procedures Under Court Rule
A. Applicability
MCR 3.602 applies to all forms of arbitration not governed by th e
Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA). Specifically, MCR 3.602(A) provides:
“Courts shall have all powers described in [the UAA], or
reasonably related thereto, for arbitrations governed by tha t
statute. The remainder of this rule applies to all other form s
of arbitration, in the absence of contradictory provisions i n
the arbitration agreement or limitations imposed by statute,
14
including MCL 691.1683(2).”
14 MCL 691.1683(2) provides that the UAA “does not apply to an arbitration between members of a
voluntary membership organization if arbitration is required and administered by the organization.
However, a party to such an arbitration may request a court to enter an order confirming an arbitration
award and the court may confirm the award or vacate the award for a reason contained in [MC L
691.1703(1)(a), MCL 691.1703(1)(b), or MCL 691.1703(1)(d)].”
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-19
=== Page 472 ===
Section 9.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
B. Requesting Order Under Court Rule
“A request for an order to compel or to stay arbitration or for
another order under this rule must be by motion, which shall be
heard in the manner and on the notice provided by these rules for
motions. If there is not a pending action between the parties, the
party seeking the requested relief must first file a complaint as i n
other civil actions.” MCR 3.602(B)(1).
C. Compelling or Staying Arbitration
The court may compel the parties to participate in arbitration “and
to take other steps necessary to carry out the arbitration agreement”
upon a motion “showing an agreement to arbitrate and the
opposing party’s refusal to arbitrate[.]” MCR 3.602(B)(2). Further,
“[a] motion to compel arbitration may not be denied on the ground
that the claim sought to be arbitrated lacks merit or is not filed i n
good faith, or because fault or grounds for the claim have not bee n
shown.” MCR 3.602(B)(4).
If the opposing party denies that an arbitration agreement exists, the
court must “summarily determine the issues and may order
arbitration or deny the motion.” MCR 3.602(B)(2). Similarly, “th e
court may stay an arbitration proceeding commenced or threatened
on a showing that there is no agreement to arbitrate.” MCR
3.602(B)(3). “If there is a substantial and good-faith dispute, th e
court shall summarily try the issue and may enter a stay or direc t
the parties to proceed to arbitration.” Id.
“Subject to MCR 3.310(E), an action or proceeding involving a n
issue subject to arbitration must be stayed if an order for arbitratio n
or motion for such an order has been made under [MCR 3.602]. If
the issue subject to arbitration is severable, the stay may be limited
to that issue. If a motion for an order compelling arbitration is made
in the action or proceeding in which the issue is raised, an order for
15
arbitration must include a stay.” MCR 3.602(C).
D. Arbitration Hearings
The procedures related to arbitration hearings discussed in MCR
3.602(D)-(E) and MCR 3.602(G)-(H) are outside the scope of thi s
benchbook.
15Because MCR 3.602(C) requires a stay in an action involving an issue subject to arbitration if an order for
arbitration or a motion for such an order has been made, the trial court erred when it summarily dismissed
a lien foreclosure claim even though it correctly enforced the arbitration agreement. Legacy Custom
Builders v Rogers, 345 Mich App 514, 526 (2023).
Page 9-20 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 473 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.2
E. Discovery and Subpoenas
“The court may enforce a subpoena or discovery-related order for
the attendance of a witness in this state and for the production of
records and other evidence issued by an arbitrator in connectio n
with an arbitration proceeding in another state on condition s
determined by the court so as to make the arbitration proceeding
fair, expeditious, and cost effective.” MCR 3.602(F)(1).
“A subpoena or discovery-related order issued by an arbitrator i n
another state shall be served in the manner provided by law for
service of subpoenas in a civil action in this state and, on motion t o
the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator,
enforced in the manner provided by law for enforcement of
16
subpoenas in a civil action in this state.” MCR 3.602(F)(2).
F. Arbitration Awards
An arbitration panel conducts a hearing and issues an award
pursuant to MCR 3.602(H). “A party may move for confirmation o f
an arbitration award within one year after the award was rendered.
The court may confirm the award, unless it is vacated, corrected, or
modified, or a decision is postponed, as provided in [MCR 3.602].”
MCR 3.602(I).
1. Vacating Award
“A request for an order to vacate an arbitration award unde r
this rule must be made by motion. If there is not a pendin g
action between the parties, the party seeking the requested
relief must first file a complaint as in other civil actions. A
complaint or motion to vacate an arbitration award must b e
filed no later than 21 days after the date of the arbitratio n
award.” MCR 3.602(J)(1).
“On motion of a party, the court shall vacate an award if:
(a) the award was procured by corruption, fraud,
or other undue means;
(b) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral, corruption of an arbitrator,
or misconduct prejudicing a party’s rights;
(c) the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers; or
16See Section 5.3(C) for information on subpoenas and Section 5.6 for information on foreign subpoenas.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-21
=== Page 474 ===
Section 9.2 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(d) the arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing
on a showing of sufficient cause, refused to hear
evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise
conducted the hearing to prejudice substantially a
party’s rights.
The fact that the relief could not or would not be granted by a
court of law or equity is not ground for vacating or refusing t o
confirm the award.” MCR 3.602(J)(2).
“A motion to vacate an award must be filed within 91 day s
after the date of the award. However, if the motion i s
predicated on corruption, fraud, or other undue means, it mus t
be filed within 21 days after the grounds are known or should
have been known. A motion to vacate an award in a domesti c
relations case must be filed within 21 days after the date of th e
award.” MCR 3.602(J)(3).
“In vacating the award, the court may order a rehearing befor e
a new arbitrator chosen as provided in the agreement, or, i f
there is no such provision, by the court. If the award is vacated
on grounds stated in [MCR 3.602(J)(2)(c)-(d)], the court ma y
order a rehearing before the arbitrator who made the award.
The time within which the agreement requires the award to b e
made is applicable to the rehearing and commences from th e
date of the order.” MCR 3.602(J)(4).
“If the motion to vacate is denied and there is no motion t o
modify or correct the award pending, the court shall confir m
the award.” MCR 3.602(J)(5).
2. Modifying or Correcting Award
“A request for an order to modify or correct an arbitratio n
award under this rule must be made by motion. If there is not a
pending action between the parties, the party seeking th e
requested relief must first file a complaint as in other civi l
actions. A complaint to correct or modify an arbitration award
must be filed no later than 21 days after the date of th e
arbitration award.” MCR 3.602(K)(1).
“On motion made within 91 days after the date of the award,
the court shall modify or correct the award if:
(a) there is an evident miscalculation of figures or
an evident mistake in the description of a person, a
thing, or property referred to in the award;
Page 9-22 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 475 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.2
(b) the arbitrator has awarded on a matter no t
submitted to the arbitrator, and the award may be
corrected without affecting the merits of the
decision on the issues submitted; or
(c) the award is imperfect in a matter of form, no t
affecting the merits of the controversy.” MCR
3.602(K)(2).
“If the motion is granted, the court shall modify and correct th e
award to effect its intent and shall confirm the award a s
modified and corrected. Otherwise, the court shall confirm th e
award as made.” MCR 3.602(K)(3).
“A motion to modify or correct an award may be joined in th e
alternative with a motion to vacate the award.” MCR
3.602(K)(4).
The Michigan Court of Appeals will “carefully evaluate claim s
of arbitrator error to ensure that they are not being used as a
ruse to induce [it] to review the merits of the arbitrator’ s
decision.” Nordlund & Assoc, Inc v Hesperia, 288 Mich App 222,
230 (2010). In Nordlund, the plaintiff’s allegation “that th e
calculation was faulty because the arbitrator failed to grasp th e
clear and concise meaning of the contract” actually implicate d
the arbitrator’s interpretation of the underlying contrac t
between the plaintiff and the defendant, not any mathematica l
calculations. Id. Because the plaintiff’s allegation did no t
implicate a mathematical calculation, the only other optio n
under MCR 3.602(K)(2)(a) for modification or correction of th e
award would have been based on “an evident mistake in a
description[.]” Nordlund, 288 Mich App at 229-230. Because
there was no evident mistake, “the circuit court properl y
refused to modify the arbitration award on that basis.” Id. at
230.
3. Judgment
“The court shall render judgment giving effect to the award a s
corrected, confirmed, or modified. The judgment has the sam e
force and effect, and may be enforced in the same manner, a s
other judgments.” MCR 3.602(L).
4. Costs
“The costs of the proceedings may be taxed as in civil actions,
and, if provision for the fees and expenses of the arbitrator ha s
not been made in the award, the court may allo w
compensation for the arbitrator’s services as it deems just. Th e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-23
=== Page 476 ===
Section 9.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
arbitrator’s compensation is a taxable cost in the action.” MCR
17
3.602(M).
5. Appeals
“Appeals may be taken as from orders or judgments in othe r
civil actions.” MCR 3.602(N).
9.3 Class Action
A. Generally
One or more members of a class may sue or be sued a s
representative parties if all of the following exist:
• Numerosity – “the class is so numerous that joinder of al l
members is impracticable;” MCR 3.501(A)(1).
• Commonality – “there are questions of law or fact commo n
to the members of the class that predominate over
questions affecting only individual members;” MCR
3.501(A)(1). “However, it is not sufficient to merely rais e
common questions. The common contention must be of
such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—
which means that determination of its truth or falsity will
resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one o f
the claims in one stroke.” Breiner v State of Mich, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2022) (cleaned up). “[C]ommonality requires
the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have
suffered the same injury.”Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “This factor does not require all issues i n
the litigation to be common, but merely requires th e
common issue or issues to predominate over those tha t
require individualized proof.” Id. at ___.
• Typicality – “the claims or defenses of the representativ e
parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;”
MCR 3.501(A)(1). “Typicality is concerned with whethe r
the claims of the named representatives have the same
essential characteristics of the class at large” and “require s
that the class representatives share a common core of
allegations with the class as a whole.” Breiner, ___ Mic h
App at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
• Adequacy – “the representative parties will fairly and
adequately assert and protect the interests of the class;”
MCR 3.501(A)(1).
17See Section 8.5 for information on costs.
Page 9-24 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 477 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.3
• Superiority – “the maintenance of the action will be
superior to other available methods of adjudication i n
promoting the convenient administration of justice.” MCR
3.501(A)(1). See MCR 3.501(A)(2) for a non-exclusive list of
factors a court must consider when determining whether
superiority exists.
“[A] case cannot proceed as a class action when it satisfies only
some, or even most, of [the] factors [in MCR 3.501(A)(1)].” A& M
Supply Co v Microsoft Corp, 252 Mich App 580, 597-602 (2002).
A trial court may not accept “a party’s bare assertion that the
prerequisites [listed in MCR 3.501(A)(1)] have been met.” Henry v
Dow Chem Co, 484 Mich 483, 500 (2009). Rather, the party seekin g
class certification bears the burden of providing enoug h
information to the court to establish that each prerequisite has i n
fact been met. Id. at 502. “A court may base its decision on th e
pleadings alone only if the pleadings set forth sufficient informatio n
to satisfy the court that each prerequisite is in fact met.” Id. Fo r
example, pleadings alone may be sufficient “where the fact s
necessary to support [a particular] finding are uncontested or
admitted by the opposing party.” Id. at 502-503. If the court mus t
look beyond the pleadings, the Michigan Supreme Court caution s
that “courts must not abandon the well-accepted prohibition agains t
assessing the merits of a party’s underlying claims at this early stage
in the proceedings.” Id. at 503.
“[P]laintiffs seeking class certification must provide objective
criteria by which class membership is to be determined”; “otherwise
individuals would simply be able to decide for themselves whether
they wish to be included in the class[.]” Mich Ass’n of Chiropractors v
Blue Care Network of Mich, Inc, 300 Mich App 577, 590 (2013).
“[W]hen examining a proposed class for certification, a court mus t
be able to resolve the question whether class members are included
or excluded from the class by reference to objective criteria.” Id. a t
595.
B. Timing and Procedure for Certification
Subject to the parties’ stipulation or good cause to extend the time
frame, MCR 3.501(B)(1)(a) requires that a motion for clas s
certification be made within 91 days of filing a complaint having
class action allegations. However, the court rule “does not forbid
subsequent motions for certification or mandate any particular
timing requirements for bringing them.” Hill v City of Warren, 27 6
Mich App 299, 306 (2007). In Hill, the defendants argued that MCR
3.501(B)(1)(a) precluded the plaintiffs from filing their renewed
motion for class certification because the motion was not made
within 91 days of the Supreme Court’s remand order. Hill, 276 Mic h
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-25
=== Page 478 ===
Section 9.3 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
App at 305. Having concluded that the court rule’s 91-day limi t
applied only to the parties’ initial motion for certification, the Cour t
of Appeals found “no clear error in the trial court’s finding that clas s
certification [was] appropriate.” Id. at 306, 317.
MCR 3.501(B)(1) “is properly interpreted as meaning that ‘[w]ithin
91 days after the filing of [any] complaint that includes class actio n
allegations, the plaintiff must move for certification that the actio n
may be maintained as a class action.’” Badeen v PAR, Inc, 300 Mic h
App 430, 441 (2013), vacated in part on other grounds 496 Mich 75
18
(2014) (alterations in original). Accordingly, a motion for clas s
certification may be filed within 91 days of an amended complaint.
Badeen, 300 Mich App at 441-442.
The 91-day time limit in MCR 3.501(B)(1)(a) “applies to a specific
plaintiff, and . . . should not and cannot be generalized to apply t o
unnamed putative class members.” Hanton v Hantz Fin Servs, Inc ,
306 Mich App 654, 662-663 (2014). Accordingly, an order denying a
named plaintiff’s “request to extend the time for filing a motion for
class certification because [that plaintiff] did not meet the time
requirements of MCR 3.501(B)” is not binding on an unnamed
putative class member in that case who files a class action following
the dismissal of the named plaintiff’s case. Hanton, 306 Mich App at
659-660, 666.
“If the plaintiff fails to file a certification motion within the time
allowed by [MCR 3.501(B)(1)], the defendant may file a notice of th e
failure. On the filing of such a notice, the class action allegations are
deemed stricken, and the action continues by or against the named
parties alone. The class action allegations may be reinstated only if
the plaintiff shows that the failure was due to excusable neglect.”
MCR 3.501(B)(2).
“Except on motion for good cause, the court shall not proceed wit h
consideration of the motion to certify until service of the summon s
and complaint on all named defendants or until the expiration of
any unserved summons under MCR 2.102(D).” MCR 3.501(B)(3)(a).
In ruling on a motion for certification, the court may:
• certify the class;
• deny the motion; or
• postpone its ruling pending discovery or other
preliminary procedures. MCR 3.501(B)(3)(b).
18For more information on the precedential value of an opinion with negative subsequent history, see our
note.
Page 9-26 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 479 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.3
The court must set forth a description of the class if it issues a n
order certifying a class action. MCR 3.501(B)(3)(c). The court may
also order that “the action be maintained as a class action limited t o
particular issues or forms of relief,” or that “a proposed class be
divided into separate classes with each treated as a class for
purposes of certifying, denying certification, or revoking
certification.” MCR 3.501(B)(3)(d)(i)-(ii). The action continues by or
against the named parties alone if certification is denied. MCR
3.105(B)(3)(e).
“An action for a penalty or minimum amount of recovery withou t
regard to actual damages imposed or authorized by statute may no t
be maintained as a class action unless the statute specifically
19
authorizes its recovery in a class action.” MCR 3.501(A)(5).
Additionally, “[a]n action that seeks to recover money fro m
individual members of a defendant class may not be maintained a s
a class action.” MCR 3.501(I)(1).
Subsequent class actions are not precluded where the trial cour t
denies a motion for class certification on the basis of procedural
deficiencies without ruling on the merits of the class certification.
Hanton, 306 Mich App at 665 (stating that “[p]rior class actions tha t
have been uncertified for a reason that was not substantive should
not preclude subsequent actions”).
C. Discovery
“Representative parties and intervenors are subject to discovery i n
the same manner as parties in other civil actions. Other clas s
members are subject to discovery in the same manner as person s
who are not parties, and may be required to submit to discovery
procedures applicable to parties to the extent ordered by the court.”
20
MCR 3.501(G).
D. Dismissal or Compromise
“An action certified as a class action may not be dismissed or
compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the
proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to the class i n
such manner as the court directs.” MCR 3.501(E).
19“In other words, when a statute provides for a minimum penalty irrespective of actual damages, no class
action may be maintained on the basis of that statute [under MCR 3.501(A)(5).]” Rodriguez v Hirshber g
Acceptance Corp, 341 Mich App 349, 358 (2022) (holding that “claims based on violations of statutes tha t
provide minimum damages in lieu of actual damages may not be brought as class actions, absent languag e
in the statute expressly permitting such class actions”).
20See Chapter 5 for information on discovery.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-27
=== Page 480 ===
Section 9.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
E. Judgment
A judgment involving a class action must specify the parties bound.
MCR 3.501(D)(1). If judgment is entered before a class is certified,
the judgment only binds the named parties. MCR 3.501(D)(2). A
judgment entered after certification binds all members of the clas s
who have not submitted an election to be excluded, or as otherwise
directed by the court. MCR 3.501(D)(5).
A motion for judgment or partial judgment pursuant to MCR 2.116
may be brought and determined “before the decision on the
21
question of class certification.” MCR 3.501(D)(3). “A judgmen t
entered before certification in favor of a named party does no t
preclude that party from representing the class in the action if that i s
otherwise appropriate.” Id.
“Nothing in [MCR 3.501] is intended to limit the parties to a clas s
action from proposing a settlement, or the court from entering a
judgment approving a settlement, that does not create Residual
Funds.” MCR 3.501(D)(6)(b). “Any judgment approving a proposed
settlement of a class action certified under [MCR 3.501] that may
result in the existence of Residual Funds shall provide for th e
disbursement of any such Residual Funds upon the stipulation o f
the parties and subject to the approval of the court. In matters where
the claims process has been exhausted and Residual Funds remain,
unless the judgment provides otherwise, the Residual Funds shal l
be disbursed to the Michigan State Bar Foundation to suppor t
activities and programs that promote access to the civil justice
system for low income residents of Michigan.” MCR 3.501(D)(6)(c).
F. Standard of Review
In determining whether to certify a proposed class, a trial court may
make both factual findings and discretionary determinations. Henry
v Dow Chem Co, 484 Mich 483, 495-496 (2009). A trial court’s finding s
of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its discretionary decision s
are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Id. at 496.
9.4 Contracts
A. Elements
“The essential elements of a contract are parties competent t o
contract, a proper subject matter, legal consideration, mutuality of
21See Section 4.2 for information on motions for summary disposition.
Page 9-28 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 481 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.4
agreement, and mutuality of obligation.” Mallory v Detroit, 181 Mic h
App 121, 127 (1989). “An implied contract must also satisfy th e
elements of mutual assent and consideration.” Id.
B. Burden of Proof
“[W]here a party endeavors to prove only that some expres s
condition contained in a written contract actually occurred [or did
not occur],” the burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence.
Stein v Home-Owners Ins Co, 303 Mich App 382, 390-391 (2013). Clea r
and convincing evidence is required in the following situations:
• to demonstrate a waiver or modification of a n
existing contract;
• to establish an oral contract when one party has acted
in reliance on the contract and the statute of fraud s
would normally serve to bar the contract;
• to establish a basis for reforming a contract; or
• to establish the contents of a lost contract. Id. at 390
(citations omitted).
C. Construction
“In determining contractual rights and obligations, a court mus t
look to the intention of the parties, and a contract should always be
construed so that it carries that intention into effect. When the
words of a written contract are clear and unambiguous and have a
definite meaning, the court has no right to look to extrinsic evidence
to determine their intent. Indeed, if the language of the entire
contract is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for constructio n
by the courts, and in such case, the language must be held to expres s
the intention of the parties and the court need not search for
meanings nor indulge in inferences as to the intention of the
22
parties.” DeVries v Brydges, 57 Mich App 36, 41 (1974). See also C-
Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___
(2025) (“noting that extrinsic evidence may only be considered
when contractual language is ambiguous”), citing In re Smith Trust,
480 Mich 19, 24 (2008).
“A contract is ambiguous only if its language is reasonably
susceptible to more than one interpretation. If the terms of the
release are unambiguous, contradictory inferences become
‘subjective, and irrelevant,’ and the legal effect of the language is a
22See Section 9.4(D) for information on parol evidence.

question of law to be resolved summarily.” Gortney v Norfolk &
Western R Co, 216 Mich App 535, 540-541 (1996) (internal citation s
omitted).
“Where a contract is to be construed by its terms alone, it is the duty
of the court to interpret it; but where its meaning is obscure and it s
construction depends upon other and extrinsic facts in connectio n
with what is written, the question of interpretation should be
submitted to the jury, under proper instructions.” Klapp v United Ins
Group Agency, Inc, 468 Mich 459, 469 (2003) (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
Generally, the language of a contract is to be construed against it s
drafter. Petovello v Murray, 139 Mich App 639, 642 (1984). However,
construing a contract against the drafter to resolve ambiguou s
contract language (called the rule of contra proferentem) is applicabl e
only if the intent of the parties cannot be discerned through the use
of all conventional rules of interpretation, including an examinatio n
of relevant extrinsic evidence. Klapp, 468 Mich at 472.
Public policy. “It has long been recognized that contracts or any
provisions contained within them are void if they are i n
contravention of public policy.” Esordi v Macomb Twp, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2025). “In general, ‘competent persons shall have the
utmost liberty of contracting,’ and ‘their agreements voluntarily and
fairly made shall be held valid and enforced in the courts.’” Ingha m
Co v Mich Co Rd Comm Self-Ins Pool, 508 Mich 461, 483-484 (2021),
quoting Bronner v Detroit, 507 Mich 158, 165-166 (2021). “But where
there are definite indications in the law of some contrary publi c
policy, the contract provision must yield to public policy.” Ingha m
Co, 508 Mich at 484 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “I n
identifying the boundaries of public policy, . . . the focus of th e
judiciary must ultimately be upon the policies that, in fact, hav e
been adopted by the public through our various legal processes, and
are reflected in our state and federal constitutions, our statutes, and
the common law.” Terrien v Zwit, 467 Mich 56, 66-67 (2002) (statin g
that “administrative rules and regulations, and public rules of
professional conduct may also constitute definitive indicators of
public policy”) (Id. at 67 n 11). “While the Court in Terrien limited
the definition of public policy to policies rooted in the state or
federal constitution, state statute, or common law, the Michiga n
Constitution grants cities the power to adopt and amend a charter.”
Esordi, ___ Mich App at ___; see Const 1963, art 7, § 22. “Thus, a
city’s legislative powers are ultimately rooted in the Michiga n
Constitution.” Esordi, ___ Mich App at ___.
Insurance policy. “An insurance policy is an agreement betwee n
parties that a court interprets much the same as any other contrac t

to best effectuate the intent of the parties and the clear,
unambiguous language of the policy.” American Select Ins Co v
Inhmathong, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “To do so, the court looks to the contract as a
whole and gives meaning to all its terms.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “When the meaning of a term is no t
obvious from the policy language, the commonly used meaning
controls.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Interpretation of an insurance policy ultimately requires a two-step
inquiry: first, a determination of coverage according to the general
insurance agreement and, second, a decision regarding whether a n
exclusion applies to negate coverage.” Id. at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). In American Select, “this two-step inquiry
pose[d] two questions: first, whether there was an ‘occurrence’ a s
defined in [defendant’s] homeowner’s insurance policy, and second ,
whether [defendant’s] homeowner’s insurance policy excluded
coverage based on her purported expectation that the shooting
would occur.” Id. at ___. “To determine whether the shooting was a n
accident and, by extension, an occurrence as defined by
[defendant’s] homeowner’s insurance policy, the relevan t
consideration is whether [defendant] intended both the injury-
causing act and its consequences.” Id. at ___. “From [defendant’s]
standpoint, the shooting was an accident in that it was a n
undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance,
something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, no t
anticipated and not naturally to be expected.” Id. at ___ (quotation
marks and citation omitted).
“Exclusionary clauses in insurance policies are strictly construed i n
favor of the insured.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “Regardless, coverage under a policy is lost if an y
exclusion within the policy applies to an insured’s particular
claims.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Clea r
and specific exclusions must be given effect.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “[Defendant’s] homeowner’s insuranc e
policy excludes coverage for bodily injuries that were ‘expected or
intended’ by an insured, even if they were ‘of a different kind,
quality or degree than initially expected or intended’ or ‘sustained
by a different person, entity or property than initially expected or
intended.’” Id. at ___. “The relevant inquiry [was] whether [the
minor child’s] injuries were the natural, foreseeable, expected, and
anticipated result of [defendant] permitting [her boyfriend] t o
reside in her home, where he kept firearms.” Id. at ___.

D. Parol Evidence Rule
1. Generally
“Parol evidence of contract negotiations, or of prior o r
contemporaneous agreements that contradict or vary th e
written contract, is not admissible to vary the terms of a
contract which is clear and unambiguous.”Hamade v Sunoco,
Inc (R&M), 271 Mich App 145, 166 (2006) (cleaned up). See als o
C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mic h
___, ___ (2025) (“noting that extrinsic evidence may only b e
considered when contractual language is ambiguous”), citin g
In re Smith Trust, 480 Mich 19, 24 (2008).
2. Exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule
The parol evidence rule has four exceptions. UAW-GM Huma n
Resource Ctr v KSL Recreation Corp, 228 Mich App 486, 493
(1998). “[E]xtrinsic evidence is admissible to show (1) that th e
writing was a sham, not intended to create legal relations, (2 )
that the contract has no efficacy or effect because of fraud,
illegality, or mistake, (3) that the parties did not integrate thei r
agreement or assent to it as the final embodiment of thei r
understanding, or (4) that the agreement was only partiall y
integrated because essential elements were not reduced t o
writing.” Id.
Parol evidence is inadmissible to show that an agreement is no t
integrated when the parties have included an integratio n
clause in the contract, unless the case involves fraud or th e
“agreement is obviously incomplete ‘on its face,’” makin g
parol evidence necessary as a gap filler. UAW-GM Huma n
Resource Ctr, 228 Mich App at 502.
The parol evidence rule does not preclude the introduction o f
evidence to establish that there was a condition precedent t o
the contract that was not included within the contract. Culver v
Castro, 126 Mich App 824, 827 (1983).
A court may consider parol evidence where there is evidenc e
23
that a latent ambiguity exists in the language of a contract.
Shay v Aldrich, 487 Mich 648, 676 (2010). “To verify the
existence of a latent ambiguity, a court must examine th e
23 “A latent ambiguity exists when the language in a contract appears to be clear and intelligible an d
suggests a single meaning, but other facts create the necessity for interpretation or a choice among two o r
more possible meanings.” Shay v Aldrich, 487 Mich 648, 668 (2010) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted).

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.4
extrinsic evidence presented and determine if in fact tha t
evidence supports an argument that the contract language a t
issue, under the circumstances of its formation, is susceptibl e
to more than one interpretation. Then, if a latent ambiguity i s
found to exist, a court must examine the extrinsic evidenc e
again to ascertain the meaning of the contract language a t
issue.” Id. at 668.
E. Statutes of Frauds
Certain types of agreements are required to be in writing. See MCL
566.132 (general statute of frauds). See also MCL 566.106, whic h
states that no interest in real estate can be created or transferred,
other than a lease not exceeding one year, unless by operation of law
or unless it is in writing and signed by the person creating or
transferring the interest.
The statute of frauds does not require the entire contract to be i n
writing; “a note or memorandum of the . . . contract” is sufficient i f
“signed with an authorized signature by the party to be charged
with the . . . contract[.]” MCL 566.132(1). Examples of sufficien t
notes or memoranda include letters, account statements, a draft or
note, or a check. Kelly-Stehney & Assoc, Inc v MacDonald’s Indus Prod,
Inc (On Remand), 265 Mich App 105, 113 (2005). This requiremen t
may be fulfilled by presenting “‘several separate papers and
documents, not all of which are signed by the party to be charged,
and none of which is a sufficient memorandum in itself.’” Id.,
quoting 4 Corbin, Contracts, (rev ed), § 23.3, p 771.
“The Legislature enacted the statutes of fraud to prevent fraud or
the opportunity for fraud; the statutes were not, however, enacted
as an instrumentality to be used in aid of fraud or as a stumbling
block in the path of justice.” Glorycrest Carpenter Rd, Inc v Adams
Outdoor Advertising Ltd, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024). “The rule
[that certain instruments must be in writing] does not amount to a
strict rule that nothing may be presented in parol.” Id. at ___.
“Indeed, a memorandum or note may be sufficient to establish the
terms of the conveyance.” Id. at ___. In Glorycrest, the defendant
argued that a “Release of Right of Way did not include vali d
signatures by the grantors because the grantors’ names were typed
on the Release of Right of Way.” Id. at ___. However, “[a]
typewritten name can satisfy the statute of frauds if there i s
evidence that the person typing his or her name intended t o
authenticate the typing.” Id. at ___. “The signature to a
memorandum may be any symbol made or adopted with a n
intention, actual or apparent, to authenticate the writing as that of
the signer.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted )
(holding that “the common law of signatures . . . applies to th e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-33
=== Page 486 ===
Section 9.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
signature requirements for conveyances of an interest in land”).
Because there was unrebutted evidence that the grantor s
authenticated the typewritten signatures, “the trial court did not er r
by rejecting [defendant’s] argument that [plaintiff’s] cause of action
was barred by the statute of frauds.” Id. at ___.
However, a note or memorandum of the agreement is not sufficien t
to satisfy the statute of frauds in certain actions brought against a
financial institution pursuant to MCL 566.132(2), which provides:
“A person shall not bring an action against a financial
institution to enforce any of the following promises o r
commitments of the financial institution unless th e
promise or commitment is in writing and signed wit h
an authorized signature by the financial institution:
(a) A promise or commitment to lend money, gran t
or extend credit, or make any other financial
accommodation.
(b) A promise or commitment to renew, extend,
modify, or permit a delay in repayment or
performance of a loan, extension of credit, or other
financial accommodation.
(c) A promise or commitment to waive a provisio n
of a loan, extension of credit, or other financial
accommodation.”
The Michigan Court of Appeals explained that MCL 566.132(2) wa s
enacted to “provide greater protection to financial institutions fro m
potentially fraudulent or spurious claims by disgruntled
borrowers” than the protection generally afforded under MCL
566.132(1). Huntington Nat’l Bank v Daniel J Aronoff Living Trust, 305
Mich App 496, 509 (2014). “It is not, therefore, sufficient to show
that the financial institution memorialized a portion of the
agreement or reduced a preliminary understanding to writing and
then later orally agreed to proceed under that framework, nor is i t
sufficient to present a series of documents—some signed and others
not signed—that together purport to be the agreement; rather, the
proponent must present evidence that the financial institutio n
actually agreed to the essential terms of the promise or commitmen t
and each of those essential terms must be accompanied by the
required signature.” Id. at 511.
A loan modification agreement was unenforceable under MCL
566.132(2) where the plaintiffs attempted to enforce the writte n
agreement by “relying on many documents, including the letter s
defendant sent to plaintiffs that detail[ed] the modification process
Page 9-34 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 487 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.4
and the loan-modification agreement itself,” because none of the
writings were “‘signed with an authorized signature.’” Rodgers v
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 315 Mich App 301, 308 (2016), quotin g
MCL 566.132(2). Accordingly, “the statute of frauds bar[red] any
claim, regardless of its label, by plaintiffs to enforce any purported
agreement,” including the plaintiffs’ claims of breach of contract,
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
estoppel. Rodgers, 315 Mich App at 309.
Additionally, a note or memorandum of an agreement “to pay a
commission for or upon the sale of an interest in real estate” is no t
sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds in an action brough t
“against the owner or purchaser of the real estate[.]” MCL
566.132(3).
F. Failure to Read Contract
It is presumed that one who signs a contract has read and
understands it. McKinstry v Valley OB-GYN Clinic, PC, 428 Mich 167,
184 (1987). Generally, failure to read a contract is not grounds for
rescission absent fraud, artifice, or deception, Moffit v Sederlund, 14 5
Mich App 1, 8 (1985), nor is it a defense to enforcement, Montgomer y
v Fidelity & Guaranty Life Ins Co, 269 Mich App 126, 130 (2005).
G. Assignments
“‘An assignment of rights occurs when the assignor transfers his or
her rights or interests to the assignee.’” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v
Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025), quoting Mecosta C o
Med Ctr v Metro Group Prop & Cas Ins Co, 509 Mich 276, 284 (2022).
“Unless in some way qualified, an assignment is properly the
transfer of one’s whole interest in an estate, or chattel, or other
thing.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___ (cleaned up) (observing “that a n
assignment entails a transfer of rights to another”). “It is an
‘absolute’ transfer of the claim at issue, that extinguishes the
assignor’s rights.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Indeed, this feature i s
what separates assignments from other legal transfers of claims or
benefits.” Id. at ___. “If the transfer is less than absolute, it is not a n
assignment.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
“Though an assignment is absolute with respect to the right s
assigned away, there is flexibility in the scope of what is assigned.”
C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___ ,
___ (2025). Accordingly, “an assignor may choose to assign away
only part of their claim.” Id. at ___. “An assignment of a part of a
right, whether the part is specified as a fraction, as an amount, or
otherwise, is operative as to that part to the same extent and in the
same manner as if the part had been a separate right.” Id. at ___
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-35
=== Page 488 ===
Section 9.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(cleaned up); see also Schwartz v Tuchman, 232 Mich 345, 349-35 0
(1925). “Indeed, such partial assignments are ubiquitous in no-faul t
cases because the act contemplates and requires a multitude of
performances (i.e., payments) by the insurer, which are ofte n
assigned to the providers who performed the relevant services.” C-
Spine, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted) .
“Additionally, it has long been the law in Michigan that a claim may
be assigned for the purposes of collection, allowing the assignee t o
litigate the claim and reserving to the assignor the right to proceed s
recovered.” Id. at ___.
A counter-assignment may refer to an agreement “in which a n
assignee transfers a claim back to the original assignor.” C-Spine
Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025).
In C-Spine, “the counter-assignments from the factoring companie s
back to [the medical provider] and ‘amendments of agreements’
allowed [the medical provider] to sue as the real party in interest.”
Id. at ___ (noting “that these documents made [the medical
provider] the real party in interest again, by either transferring
claims to it or by clarifying that it always had the power to collect o n
these claims on behalf of the factoring companies”).
H. Release Agreements
“Summary disposition of a plaintiff’s complaint is proper where
there exists a valid release of liability between the parties. A release
of liability is valid if it is fairly and knowingly made. The scope of a
release is governed by the intent of the parties as it is expressed i n
the release.” Adell v Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz, PC, 170
Mich App 196, 201 (1988) (internal citations omitted). See also MCR
2.116(C)(7), which provides that summary disposition may b e
appropriate where the claim is barred because of a release.
Where the text of the release is unambiguous, the court mus t
determine the parties’ intentions using the “plain, ordinary
meaning of the language of the release.” Gortney v Norfolk & Western
R Co, 216 Mich App 535, 540 (1996). Just because the parties disagre e
about the meaning of the release does not mean it is ambiguous. Id.
24
Where there is evidence that a latent ambiguity exists with respec t
to the intended scope of a release, a court may consider parol
evidence regarding that scope. Shay v Aldrich, 487 Mich 648, 67 6
25
(2010).
24 “A latent ambiguity exists when the language in a contract appears to be clear and intelligible an d
suggests a single meaning, but other facts create the necessity for interpretation or a choice among two o r
more possible meanings.” Shay v Aldrich, 487 Mich 648, 668 (2010) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted).
Page 9-36 Michigan Judicial Institute

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.4
I. Third-Party Beneficiary
Third-party beneficiary rights are governed by MCL 600.1405. “An y
person for whose benefit a promise is made by way of
contract . . . has the same right to enforce said promise that h e
would have had if the said promise had been made directly to hi m
as the promisee.” Id.
Whether a party is a third-party beneficiary under the terms of a
release agreement is determined objectively. Shay v Aldrich, 487 Mic h
26 27
648, 675 (2010). However, where there is a latent ambiguity in
the release’s language, a subjective analysis is necessary to determin e
the parties’ intent as to the scope of a third-party beneficiary’s right s
under the release. Id. (Emphasis added.)
A person who qualifies as a third-party beneficiary gains the righ t
to sue for enforcement of a contract promise, but he or she “is no t
automatically entitled to the sought-after benefit merely by
qualifying as a third-party beneficiary.” Shay, 487 Mich at 666.
Consequently, a court must adhere to the “basic principles of
contract interpretation when determining the extent of the third
28
party’s rights under the contract.” Id.
“A person is a third-party beneficiary of a contract only when tha t
contract establishes that a promisor has undertaken a promise
‘directly’ to or for that person.” Schmalfeldt v North Pointe Ins Co, 469
Mich 422, 428 (2003). See also MCL 600.1405. Only intended
beneficiaries, not incidental, “may sue for a breach of a contractual
promise in their favor. Schmalfeldt, 469 Mich at 427. A court should
limit its review to the “form and meaning” of the contract when it i s
deciding whether a party is a third-party beneficiary under MCL
600.1405. Schmalfeldt, 469 Mich at 428. Further, a third-part y
beneficiary must plead facts demonstrating his or her status as a
named beneficiary of a contract in order to recover under the
contract. Maki Estate v Coen, 318 Mich App 532, 544 (2017) (rejecting
the plaintiff’s argument that the defendants knew that their service s
were for the plaintiff’s benefit because “mere knowledge of a benefi t
to a third party is not enough”).
25See Section 9.4(D)(2) for information on parol evidence and further discussion of the Shay case.
26See Section 9.4(H) for information on release agreements.
27 “A latent ambiguity exists when the language in a contract appears to be clear and intelligible an d
suggests a single meaning, but other facts create the necessity for interpretation or a choice among two o r
more possible meanings.” Shay v Aldrich, 487 Mich 648, 668 (2010) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted).
28See Section 9.4(C) for information on contract construction.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-37
=== Page 490 ===
Section 9.4 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
In general, although a property owner ultimately benefits from the
work performed by a subcontractor on the property owner’ s
property, the property owner is not an intended third-party
beneficiary of the contract between the general contractor and the
subcontractor. Kisiel v Holz, 272 Mich App 168, 171 (2006). “Absen t
clear contractual language to the contrary, a property owner doe s
not attain intended third-party-beneficiary status merely because
the parties to the subcontract knew, or even intended, that the
construction would ultimately benefit the property owner.” Id. As a
result, a property owner generally cannot sue for breach of contrac t
a subcontractor who performed work on the property owner’ s
property. Id. at 172.
However, a plaintiff was an intended third-party beneficiary of th e
contract between the contractor and the subcontractor where (1) the
contract expressly and directly referenced the plaintiff by name, (2)
the defendant (subcontractor) promised to perform work at the
plaintiff’s residence, and (3) the plaintiff and the defendan t
discussed and agreed on the work to be performed. Vanerian v
Charles L Pugh Co, Inc, 279 Mich App 431, 434, 436 (2008).
J. Damages
“The goal in awarding damages for breach of contract is to give the
innocent party the benefit of his bargain—to place him in a positio n
equivalent to that which he would have attained had the contrac t
been performed. The injured party, however, must make every
reasonable effort to minimize the loss suffered, and the damage s
must be reduced by any benefits accruing to the plaintiff as a
consequence of the breach. In other words, under the avoidable
consequences doctrine, the plaintiff is not allowed to recover for
losses he could have avoided by reasonable effort or expenditure.
He has a duty to do whatever may reasonably be done to minimize
his loss. Closely related to the avoidable consequences rule is the
requirement that any benefit to the plaintiff arising from or as a
result of the breach must reduce the damages otherwise payable.”
Tel-Ex Plaza, Inc v Hardees Restaurants, Inc, 76 Mich App 131, 134-135
(1977).
The plaintiff has a duty to mitigate his or her damages, and the
defendant has the burden of proving that the plaintiff failed to d o
so. Lawrence v Will Darrah & Assoc, Inc, 445 Mich 1, 15, 15 n 18 (1994).
K. Equitable Remedies in Contract Actions
The equitable remedies of rescission, promissory estoppel, specifi c
performance, and quantum meruit are discussed in Section 9.6 o f
this benchbook.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.5
L. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision regarding the interpretation of a contract or
the legal effect of a contractual clause is reviewed de novo.
McDonald v Farm Bureau Ins Co, 480 Mich 191, 197 (2008).
The trial court’s determination of the amount of damages for a
breach of contract case is reviewed for clear error. Triple E Produce
Corp v Mastronardi Produce, Ltd, 209 Mich App 165, 177 (1995).
9.5 Declaratory Judgments
A. Court’s Power to Enter Declaratory Judgment
Any Michigan court of record with jurisdiction “[i]n a case of actual
controversy within its jurisdiction,” may entertain a declaratory
judgment action in that case, “whether or not other relief is or could
be sought or granted.” MCR 2.605(A)(1). Circuit, district, and
probate courts have jurisdiction in any case in which they would
have jurisdiction if other relief was sought. MCR 2.605(A)(2). “Whe n
there is no actual controversy, the court lacks jurisdiction to issue a
declaratory judgment.” Mercurio v Huntington Nat'l Bank, 347 Mich
App 662, 675 (2023) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “A n
actual controversy exists when declaratory relief is needed to guide
a plaintiff’s future conduct in order to preserve the plaintiff’s legal
rights.” Id. at 675 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “When th e
injury a plaintiff seeks to prevent is merely hypothetical, a case of
actual controversy does not exist.” Id. at 675.
“An actual controversy exists when declaratory relief is needed t o
guide a plaintiff’s future conduct in order to preserve the plaintiff’ s
legal rights.” Glorycrest Carpenter Rd, Inc v Adams Outdoor
Advertising Ltd, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). In Glorycrest, plaintiff had “a concrete and distinc t
interest in the proper interpretation and application of bot h
governing instruments as a successor party to the lease and a
successor in interest of property affected by a restrictive covenant.”
Id. at ___ (holding that plaintiff “identified an ‘actual controversy ’
involving the controlling instruments that required a court t o
‘declare the rights and other legal relations’ of the parties affected
by the governing instruments and necessitating guidance as t o
future conduct”). Glorycrest, ___ Mich App at ___, quoting MCR
2.605(A)(1). “Although [plaintiff] labeled its claim as one for
declaratory relief, it alleged that the lease was unenforceable
because of mutual mistake and should be rescinded.” Id. at ___
(noting that “courts are not governed by the labels chosen by th e
parties” and that courts “determine the nature of an action b y
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-39
=== Page 492 ===
Section 9.5 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
reading the complaint as a whole to determine the gravamen of the
claim”). Because plaintiff “alleged a cause of action that combine d
an action for reformation or rescission with a request for declaratory
relief,” the trial court “had jurisdiction to declare the rights and
obligations of the parties under the lease regardless of the label
[plaintiff] chose.”Glorycrest, ___ Mich App at ___, citing MCR
2.605(A)(2).
“[D]eclaratory relief is not mandatory.” Van Buren Charter Twp v
Visteon Corp, 319 Mich App 538, 550 (2017). “[T]he language i n
[MCR 2.605] is permissive, and the decision whether to gran t
declaratory relief is within the trial court’s sound discretion.” Van
Buren Charter Twp, 319 Mich App at 545, 550 (holding that a trial
court may still deny declaratory relief even where a party’s claim s
have merit).
A declaratory judgment has “the force and effect of, and are
reviewable as, final judgments.” MCR 2.605(E).
B. Actual Controversy Required
There must be an actual controversy that causes a party to seek a
declaration of rights or legal relationships. MCR 2.605(A)(1); MCR
2.111(B)(2). “An ‘actual controversy’ under MCR 2.605(A)(1) exist s
when a declaratory judgment is necessary to guide a plaintiff' s
future conduct in order to preserve legal rights. The requiremen t
prevents a court from deciding hypothetical issues. However, by
granting declaratory relief in order to guide or direct future
conduct, courts are not precluded from reaching issues before actual
injuries or losses have occurred. The essential requirement of a n
‘actual controversy’ under the rule is that the plaintiff pleads and
proves facts that demonstrate an adverse interest necessitating the
sharpening of the issues raised. UAW v Central Mich Univ Trustees,
295 Mich App 486, 495 (2012) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted).
C. Jury Trial
A jury trial may be demanded in a declaratory action “under the
circumstances and in the manner provided in the constitution ,
statutes, and court rules of the State of Michigan.” MCR 2.605(B).
See Chapter 7 for more information on jury trials.
D. Expedited Hearing
“The court may order a speedy hearing of an action for declaratory
relief and may advance it on the calendar.” MCR 2.605(D).
Page 9-40 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 493 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
E. Other Relief
Once a declaratory judgment has determined the rights of the
parties, additional “necessary or proper relief” may be granted,
including monetary damages, following reasonable notice and
hearing. MCR 2.605(F); Hofmann v Auto Club Ins Ass’n, 211 Mich
App 55, 90 (1995).
F. Standard of Review
Questions of law arising from a declaratory judgment are reviewed
de novo; whether to grant or deny declaratory relief is reviewed for
an abuse of discretion. Guardian Environmental Svcs, Inc v Bureau o f
Const Codes & Fire Safety, 279 Mich App 1, 5-6 (2008).
9.6 Equity
A. Generally
Equitable relief may be granted if a legal remedy is not available.
Tkachik v Mandeville, 487 Mich 38, 45 (2010). A complete, ample, an d
certain remedy at law that is as effectual as equitable relie f
precludes a suit in equity. Id. When granting equitable relief, th e
court may fashion a remedy warranted by the circumstances. Three
Lakes Ass’n v Kessler, 91 Mich App 371, 377-378 (1979). The remedy
must be specific and enforceable, or it will not be granted. Id. at 378.
The court’s broad discretionary powers regarding equity are not t o
be used to enlarge a party’s statutory rights. Dumas v Helm, 15 Mic h
App 148, 152 (1968). “Where a statute is applicable to th e
circumstances and dictates the requirements for relief by one party,
equity will not interfere.” Stephens v Dep't of Corr, ___ Mich App ___ ,
___ (2025) (cleaned up) (noting “that principles of equity do no t
apply when a statute governs the issue”). Indeed, “if a court is free
to cast aside, under the guise of equity, a plain statute, simply
because the court views the statute as unfair, then our system of
government ceases to function as a representative democracy.” Id. a t
___ (cleaned up). “This principle is the Plymouth Rock of our
American rule of law, where written laws prevail over the subjective
views of judges.” Id. at ___; Marbury v Madison, 5 US 137, 163 (1803)
(“The government of the United States has been emphatically
termed a government of laws, and not of men.”).
Generally, the circuit court has jurisdiction over actions in equity.
MCL 600.601. However, district courts also have limited jurisdictio n
over certain actions in equity. MCL 600.8302. See Section 2.4 for
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-41

Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
more information on circuit court jurisdiction and Section 2.3 o n
district court jurisdiction.
B. Jury Trial
“There is no right to a jury trial where the relief sought is solely
equitable in nature.” Thomas v Steuernol, 185 Mich App 148, 155-156
(1990). However, MCR 2.509(D) permits equitable claims to b e
decided by a jury with the consent of the parties. McPeak v McPeak,
457 Mich 311, 315 (1998). Where a party includes a jury demand
with his or her complaint and pays a jury demand fee, but the
complaint contains equitable counts, “the filing of the jury demand,
standing by itself, certainly is not conclusive evidence that the
[party] ‘consented’ to a jury trial on [the] equitable claims[.]”
Zurcher v Herveat, 238 Mich App 267, 302-303 (1999) (the complain t
contained equitable and nonequitable claims, and the record
indicated that plaintiff intended for the court to decide the equitable
claims).
“[I]n cases involving both equitable and legal issues, juries may
decide factual issues relating to a claim for money damages, while
judges retain the authority to determine the facts as they relate t o
equitable remedies[.]” ECCO Ltd v Balimoy Mfg Co, 179 Mich App
748, 751 (1989). “[E]quity jurisdiction is appropriate for all actions
based on ‘traditionally equitable’ doctrines[.]” Id. at 750. “However,
in addition to the assertion of a traditionally equitable claim, equity
jurisdiction also requires that a plaintiff seek traditionally equitabl e
relief.” Id. (holding the trial court erred in not sending plaintiff’ s
action for promissory estoppel to the jury where money damage s
were the only relief requested). See Section 9.6(F) for mor e
information on promissory estoppel.
C. Unclean Hands
“The unclean-hands doctrine is ‘a self-imposed ordinance tha t
closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted wit h
inequitablenss or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seek s
relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the [opposing
party].’” New Products Corp v Harbor Shores BHBT Land Dev, LLC, 331
Mich App 614, 627 (2020) (alteration in original), quoting Rose v
Nat’l Auction Group, 466 Mich 453, 463 (2002). “Any willful act that
transgresses equitable standards of conduct is sufficient to allow a
court to deny a party equitable relief.” New Products Corp, 331 Mich
App at 627. In Rose, the plaintiffs were attempting to sell a piece of
property they owned using the defendant-auction company. Rose,
466 Mich at 456. In an effort to secure a higher bid, the plaintiff s
agreed to allow the defendant to use a planted bidder (who had n o
intention of buying the property) to drive up the bid. Id. at 457-458.
Page 9-42 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 495 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
When the planted bidder failed to make a bid, and the property sold
for much less than the plaintiff expected, the plaintiffs sued the
defendant. Id. at 458-460. The Court concluded that the plaintiffs’
involvement in the planted bidder scheme precluded them fro m
bringing suit against the defendant, citing the clean hands doctrine.
Id. at 464.
D. Laches
“‘Estoppel by laches is the failure to do something which should be
done under the circumstances or the failure to claim or enforce a
right at a proper time.’” Wells Fargo Bank, NA v Null, 304 Mich App
508, 537 (2014), quoting Schmude Oil Co v Omar Operating Co, 184
Mich App 574, 583 (1990). “A party guilty of laches is estopped fro m
asserting a right it could have and should have asserted earlier.”
New Products Corp v Harbor Shores BHBT Land Dev, LLC, 331 Mic h
App 614, 627 (2020) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Th e
application of the doctrine of laches requires a passage of time
combined with a change in condition which would make i t
inequitable to enforce the claim against the defendant. I n
determining whether a party is guilty of laches, each case must be
determined on its own particular facts.” Sedger v Kinnco, Inc, 17 7
Mich App 69, 73 (1988) (internal citations omitted). “‘To successfully
assert laches as an affirmative defense, a defendant mus t
demonstrate prejudice occasioned by the delay.’” Wells Fargo Bank,
NA, 304 Mich App at 538, quoting Schmude Oil Co, 184 Mich App a t
583. See also Eagan v Detroit, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (stating
that laches “requires a showing of an unexcused or unexplained delay
in commencing an action and a corresponding change of material
condition that results in prejudice to a party”) (quotation marks and
citation omitted).
“Laches is an equitable tool that may be used to remedy the
inconvenience or prejudice to a party caused by an improper delay
in asserting a right.” Fraser Twp v Haney, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025) (quotation marks and citation omitted). “For laches to apply,
the enforcing party must have unreasonably delayed it s
enforcement efforts and that delay must have caused prejudice t o
the other party.” Id. at ___. “Stated differently, the defendant mus t
prove that the plaintiff’s lack of due diligence prejudiced them.” Id.
at ___. “In general, due diligence means undertaking reasonable,
good-faith measures under the circumstances, not necessarily
undertaking everything possible.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “Laches can be applied to bar an attempt to abat e
a zoning ordinance violation.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted) (concluding that “because defendant [did] no t
[undermine] the trial court’s conclusion that plaintiff promptl y

Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
sought abatement of the pig nuisance, the trial court did not err by
holding that laches did not bar the suit”).
The statutes of limitations apply equally to all legal and equitabl e
actions, and “[t]he equitable doctrine of laches shall also apply i n
actions where equitable relief is sought.” MCL 600.5815. “Th e
doctrine of laches may bar a claim even where the action is brough t
within the applicable limitations period.” New Products Corp, 331
Mich App at 627. “The application of laches can shorten but neve r
lengthen, the analogous statute of limitations.” Tenneco, Inc v
Amerisure Mut Ins Co, 281 Mich App 429, 456-457 (2008).
E. Equitable Estoppel
“‘Estoppel arises where a party, by representations, admissions or
silence, intentionally or negligently induces another party to believe
facts, and the other party justifiably relies and acts on this belief,
and will be prejudiced if the first party is permitted to deny the
existences of the facts.’” Wigfall v Detroit, 322 Mich App 36, 43, 44
(2017) (holding that equitable estoppel did not apply where the
plaintiff “relied on information provided by defendant through it s
law department that was meant to relate solely to informal claim s
against defendant,” and that the plaintiff could not rely on the
defendant’s “interpretation or misinterpretation” of notice
requirements “as a justification or excuse for his failure to act i n
conformity with [the notice] requirements”), quoting Casey v Aut o
Owners Ins Co, 273 Mich App 388, 399 (2006).
“[E]quitable estoppel is not a cause of action unto itself; it i s
available only as a defense.” Casey, 273 Mich App at 399 (affirmin g
the trial court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’ equitable estoppel clai m
where the plaintiffs attempted to assert it as a cause of action).
Equitable estoppel is “a doctrine that may assist a party by
precluding the opposing party from asserting or denying the
existence of a particular fact.” New Products Corp v Harbor Shore s
BHBT Land Dev, LLC, 331 Mich App 614, 627-628 (2020) (quotation
marks and citation omitted).
“Equitable estoppel may preclude the enforcement of a zoning
ordinance if a party reasonably relies to its prejudice on a
representation made by the municipality.” Fraser Twp v Haney, ___
Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Generally, however, townships will not be estopped fro m
enforcing their ordinance absent exceptional circumstances.” Id. a t
___ (“Casual private advice offered by township officials does no t
constitute exceptional circumstances.”) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “A municipality may be estopped from enforcin g
its zoning ordinance if it grants official permission to do something
Page 9-44 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 497 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
that is not actually allowed under its ordinance, and it then waits t o
correct its error until after the permittee has relied in good faith o n
that permit and expended significant resources constructing
specialty facilities that cannot be put to any other use.” Id. at ___.
“Similarly, a governmental entity may be estopped from suddenly
enforcing its rights against an innocent third party if its official s
formally, even if illegally, spent almost two decades affirmatively
acting as if it had no rights to enforce while the innocent partie s
expended significant resources relying on the governmental entity’ s
conduct.” Id. at ___.
In Fraser, “defendant did not establish that he received official o r
formal permission from plaintiff.” Id. at ___. Rather, “the individua l
township supervisor only told defendant that his acreage was ‘close
enough’ and did not tell him that raising deer or pigs wa s
forbidden.” Id. at ___. “In other words, the supervisor did not tell
defendant that the farm was formally approved, or affirmatively ac t
as if defendant’s farm was approved.” Id. at ___ (citations omitted) .
“At most, defendant received ‘casual private advice’ from a n
individual official, which ‘does not constitute exceptional
circumstances’ justifying equitable estoppel.” Id. at ___. “Even if i t
could be said that the supervisor’s statements blessed defendant’ s
plan, a municipality cannot be estopped from enforcing a zoning
ordinance because of the unauthorized action of its agents and
administrative employees in granting permissive authority contrary
to the terms of the ordinance.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “A historical
failure to enforce a particular zoning ordinance, standing alone, i s
insufficient to preclude enforcement in the present.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up) (stating that “merely failing to enforce an ordinance i s
insufficient to give rise to equitable estoppel”).
F. Promissory Estoppel
The doctrine of promissory estoppel means:
“‘A promise which the promisor should reasonabl y
expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of th e
promisee or a third person and which does induce suc h
action or forbearance is binding if injustice can b e
avoided only by enforcement of the promise. Th e
remedy granted for breach may be limited as justic e
requires.’” State Bank of Standish v Curry, 442 Mich 76, 8 3
(1993), quoting 1 Restatement Contracts, 2d, § 90, p 242.
The reliance must be reasonable, and it is only reasonable if it wa s
based on an actual promise. State Bank, 442 Mich at 84. “T o
determine the existence and scope of a promise, [courts should]
look to the words and actions of the transaction as well as the nature
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-45
=== Page 498 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
of the relationship between the parties and the circumstance s
surrounding their actions.” Id. at 86.
G. Judicial Estoppel
“Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine, which generally prevent s
a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and
then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another
phase.” Andros v Andros, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025). Under the
“prior success model” of judicial estoppel, “‘a party who ha s
successfully and unequivocally asserted a position in a prio r
proceeding is estopped from asserting an inconsistent position in a
subsequent proceeding.’” Id. at ___, quoting Lichon v American Uni v
Ins Co, 435 Mich 408, 416 (1990). “For judicial estoppel to apply,
‘there must be some indication that the court in the earlier
proceeding accepted that party’s position as true,’ and ‘the claim s
must be wholly inconsistent.’” Andros, ___ Mich App at ___, quotin g
Paschke v Retool Indus, 445 Mich 502, 510 (1994).
In order for a party to assert judicial estoppel based on a prior
bankruptcy petition, “a reviewing court must find that
(1) the plaintiff assumed a position that was contrary t o
the one that she asserted under oath in the bankruptc y
proceedings; (2) the bankruptcy court adopted th e
contrary position either as a preliminary matter or a s
part of a final disposition; and (3) the plaintiff’ s
omission did not result from mistake or inadvertence. I n
determining whether the plaintiff’s conduct resulted
from mistake or inadvertence, the reviewing cour t
considers whether: (1) the plaintiff lacked knowledge o f
the factual basis of the undisclosed claims; (2) th e
plaintiff had a motive for concealment; and (3) th e
evidence indicates an absence of bad faith. I n
determining whether there was an absence of bad faith,
the reviewing court will look, in particular, at th e
plaintiff’s attempts to advise the bankruptcy court of th e
plaintiff’s omitted claim.” [Andros, ___ Mich App at __ _
(cleaned up) (applying prior success model t o
bankruptcy proceedings).
“‘The purpose of the doctrine of judicial estoppel, especially in the
context of bankruptcy proceedings, is to protect the judicial process,
not the parties.’” Id. at ___, quoting Spohn v Van Dyke Pub Sch, 29 6
Mich App 470, 489 (2012). In Andros, “[a]fter agreeing to repay he r
mother for the mortgage on a home she hoped to one day own,
plaintiff . . . filed for bankruptcy and declared that she had no legal
or equitable interest in the property.” Andros, ___ Mich App at ___.
Page 9-46 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 499 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
“When the mother-daughter relationship soured, her
mother . . . sought to evict her.” Id. at ___. “In response, [plaintiff ]
sued her mother, asserting legal ownership and equitable claims t o
the home.” Id. at ___ (noting that plaintiff’s “claims for constructiv e
trust, breach of contract, quiet title, and injunctive relief [were] all
ultimately derived from her asserted ownership interest in the
house”). “Because she unambiguously denied having any suc h
ownership interest in her bankruptcy petition, [the Andros Court ]
affirm[ed] the trial court’s grant of summary disposition on those
counts.” Id. at ___. “She is assuming a position contrary to the on e
she asserted in bankruptcy; the bankruptcy court adopted her prior
position in discharging her debts; and her misstatement was not the
result of any legally cognizable mistake or inadvertence.” Id. at ___.
“She knew she intended to own the house once it was paid off, her
concealment helped secure bankruptcy relief, and she never
corrected the record after the bankruptcy case began.” Id. at ___.
While “a close familial relationship” may explain plaintiff’s belief
that she had an ownership interest in the house, “she represented t o
the bankruptcy court that she did not have an interest in the house,
and the purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the
judicial process.” Id. at ___ (holding that “judicial estoppel bar s
[plaintiff] from claiming ownership of the home she once
disavowed, but it does not necessarily bar her [unjust enrichment or
quantum meruit claim] seeking compensation for what she put int o
it”).
H. Unconscionability
“Parties may make and carry out any agreement they please whic h
does not affect the public or the rights of third persons, but in case
of dispute they must not expect the courts to enforce any
unconscionable bargain they may have thought proper to make.”
Myer v Hart, 40 Mich 517, 523 (1879). “In Michigan ,
unconscionability has generally been recognized to include a n
absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the partie s
together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable t o
the other party.” Rayford v American House Roseville I, LLC, ___ Mic h
___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up).
“The examination of a contract for unconscionability involves
inquiries for both procedural and substantive unconscionability. ”
Hubscher & Son, Inc v Storey, 228 Mich App 478, 481 (1998 )
(“Reasonableness is the primary consideration.”). “Accordingly,
there is a two-pronged test for determining whether a contract i s
unenforceable as unconscionable, which is stated as follows:
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-47
=== Page 500 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(1) What is the relative bargaining power of the parties,
their relative economic strength, the alternative source s
of supply, in a word, what are their options?;
(2) Is the challenged term substantively unreasonable? ”
[Id. (cleaned up)].
“In order for a contract to be considered unconscionable, it must be
both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.” Rayford, ___
Mich at ___.
Procedural unconscionability. “Procedural unconscionability exists
when a weaker party [has] no realistic alternative but to accept the
term.” Rayford, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “There are numerous factors that may render a contrac t
procedurally unconscionable.” Id. at ___. Courts “have looked t o
factors such as the sophistication of the parties, the parties’ relative
market power and economic status, and a party’s education in a
field.” Id. at ___, citing Gillam v Mich Mtg-Investment Corp, 224 Mich
405, 409 (1923), and Styninger v Courtright, 229 Mich 399, 403-40 4
(1924). “Our caselaw states that if one party to a contract possesse s
little to no bargaining power, the contract is procedurally
unconscionable.” Rayford, ___ Mich at ___.
“The unconscionability analysis is similar to the reasonablenes s
analysis for analyzing adhesion contracts.” Id. at ___. In Rayford,
“plaintiff argued that the shortened limitations period wa s
procedurally unconscionable because at the time she signed the
Acknowledgment, she had no realistic alternative to employmen t
with defendant.” Rayford, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). “The Court of Appeals rejected this argument,
stating instead that plaintiff did not provide evidence that she
lacked other employment options.” Id. at ___. On appeal, the
Michigan Supreme Court held “in order to prove the existence of
procedural unconscionability, an employee [need not] demonstrat e
that they do not have any other employment options.” Id. at ___
(rejecting argument that “a plaintiff must have no alternative
whatsoever”). “[T]his leaves the employee with one of two options :
(1) sign the employment contract as drafted by the employer or (2)
lose the job.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Th e
ability to quit one’s job is not, in and of itself, a meaningful or
realistic alternative.” Id. at ___. “This is not a choice for an employe e
presented with a boilerplate agreement.” Id. at ___. “While th e
ability to walk away from the proverbial contract-creation table
might work in some contexts, it does not work well in the context of
a boilerplate employment agreement.” Id. at ___. “Employees mus t
maintain employment to make a living.” Id. at ___. “Saying that an
employee can simply quit a job is incredibly obtuse to the reality
that almost everyone needs employment to support themselves and
Page 9-48 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 501 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
others.” Id. at ___. “For these reasons, based on the recor d
presented, it is possible that the contract is procedurally
unconscionable.” Id. at ___ (“remand[ing] the matter to the tria l
court so that the record can be further developed to determine the
reasonableness of the shortened limitations period and whether the
provision was unconscionable”).
Substantive unconscionability. “Substantive unconscionability
requires courts to analyze the reasonableness of the challenged
term.” Rayford, ___ Mich at ___. “A contract provision i s
substantively unreasonable if the inequity shocks the conscience.”
Id. at ___ (cleaned up). In Rayford, the Michigan Supreme Court held
that an employee “lacked bargaining power when she wa s
presented with a boilerplate employment agreement that contained
a shortened limitations period of 180 days.” Id. at ___. “The contrac t
was adhesive and, as a result, warrants close judicial scrutiny of the
challenged shortened limitations provision.” Id. at ___. “Whether t o
label a contract adhesive, whether to review a contractual provisio n
for reasonableness, and whether a contractual provision i s
unconscionable are all interconnected.” Id. at ___ n 32. Because th e
record in the case was not complete, the Rayford Court instructed the
circuit court to “determine whether the shortened limitations period
was unreasonable, and therefore substantively unconscionable, i n
the first instance.” Id. at ___ (“tak[ing] no position on the outcome of
the unconscionability analysis and leav[ing] that for the trial cour t
to reach, if necessary, on remand”).
See Section 9.4 for additional information on contract actions.
I. Quantum Meruit
“The theory underlying quantum meruit recovery is that the law
will imply a contract in order to prevent unjust enrichment whe n
one party inequitably receives and retains a benefit from another.”
Morris Pumps v Centerline Piping, Inc, 273 Mich App 187, 194 (2006).
In order to prevail on a quantum meruit claim, a plaintiff mus t
establish:
• that the defendant received a benefit from the plaintiff, and
• the defendant retained the benefit, which resulted in a n
inequity to the plaintiff. Morris Pumps, 273 Mich App a t
195.
A quantum meruit claim is not appropriate where an express
contract exists between two parties. Morris Pumps, 273 Mich App a t
199.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-49
=== Page 502 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“In a tort action, an injured party may seek damages for an injury
caused by the breach of a legal duty.” Genesee Co Drain Comm’r v
Genesee Co, 504 Mich 410, 419 (2019). “As in tort, the remedy for [a
breach-of-contract action] may be compensatory damages.” Id.
“Unjust enrichment, by contrast, doesn’t seek to compensate for a n
injury but to correct against one party’s retention of a benefit a t
another’s expense, [a]nd the correction, or remedy, is therefore no t
compensatory damages, but restitution.” Id. “Because unjus t
enrichment sounds in neither tort nor contract and seeks restitutio n
rather than compensatory damages,” “the [Governmental Tor t
Liability Act, MCL 691.1401 et seq.,] does not bar [an unjus t
enrichment] claim.” Genesee Co Drain Comm’r, 504 Mich at 423-424.
While a quantum meruit claim is equitable in nature, it is no t
automatically a purely equitable claim that must be brought i n
circuit court where the relief sought is money damages in a n
amount less than $25,000. Meisner Law Group, PC v Weston Downs
Condo Ass’n, 321 Mich App 702, 726-728 (2017). In Meisner, “because
plaintiff sought only legal relief—money damages—the distric t
court ‘ha[d] exclusive jurisdiction’ of plaintiff’s civil actio n
involving contract and quasi-contract claims because the
undisputed evidence show[ed] that ‘the amount in controversy
[did] not exceed $25,000.00.’” Id. at 730, quoting MCL 600.8301.
“Although plaintiff’s theory of recovery rest[ed] on equitable
principals of unjust enrichment,” its “complaint [did] not sound
primarily in equity or seek equitable relief,” and “the relief sough t
by a plaintiff determines its procedural rights.” The Meisner La w
Group, PC, 321 Mich App at 726, 729.
J. Specific Performance
The court, in equity, may grant complete relief to a party in the for m
of specific performance, including an award of damages. Reinink v
Van Loozenoord, 370 Mich 121, 127 (1963). “The granting of specifi c
performance lies within the discretion of the court and whether or
not it should be granted depends upon the particular circumstance s
of each case.” Derosia v Austin, 115 Mich App 647, 652 (1982).
Ordinarily, specific performance will not be granted “unless the
party seeking the decree has tendered full performance.” Derosia,
115 Mich App at 652. However, formal tender is not required
“where the defendant by his words or acts has shown that it woul d
not be accepted.” Frakes v Eghigian, 358 Mich 327, 333 (1960). I n
Frakes (a real property case), the Court concluded that tender of
performance was unnecessary where the defendant intentionally
failed to attend several scheduled meetings at which the partie s
were supposed to close on the property. Id.

K. Rescission
“If the court recognizes a rescission, an equitable remedy, it is as if
the contract at issue never existed.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v
Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025) (“contrast[ing] the
equitable remedy of rescission with the myriad of other ways i n
which the parties to a contract could repudiate, terminate, cancel, or
otherwise end their contractual relationship”). “To rescind a
contract is not merely to terminate it, but to abrogate and undo i t
from the beginning.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Rescission abrogates a
contract completely.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “All former contrac t
rights are annulled, and it is as if no contract had been made.” Id. a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Notably, “rescission of a contract subject to litigation ‘does no t
function by automatic operation of the law.’” C-Spine, ___ Mich a t
___, quoting Bazzi v Sentinel Ins Co, 502 Mich 390, 411 (2018).
“Rather, it is an equitable remedy that the trial court may grant, i n
its discretion, after balancing the equities.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___.
“These same equitable considerations apply to a court’s decision t o
extend the effect of a rescission to a third party.” Id. at ___; see als o
Univ of Mich Regents v Mich Auto Ins Placement Facility, 340 Mich Ap p
196, 206 (2022). Univ of Mich Regents noted “that trial courts are
required to balance the equities between a defrauded insurer and a n
innocent third party before extending the mutual rescission of a no-
fault insurance policy to the third party.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___.
“Most of [the Michigan Supreme] Court’s recent decisions regarding
rescission in the no-fault context involve the rescission of no-faul t
automobile insurance policies.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v
Progressive Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ n 24 (2025). See e.g., Bazzi,
502 Mich at 396; Wilmore-Moody v Zakir, 511 Mich 76, 79 (2023) ;
Esurance Prop & Cas Ins Co v Mich Assigned Claims Plan, 507 Mic h
29
498, 503 (2021). “However, these represent only one potential
application of the broadly available remedy of rescission.” C-Spine,
___ Mich at ___ n 24. See, e.g., Lenawee Co Bd of Health v Messerly, 417
29“In both Wilmore-Moody and Bazzi, [the Michigan Supreme] Court recognized that the voiding ab initio
of a contract, as a result of rescission, is a legal fiction that alters the legal relations between th e
contracting parties, but not necessarily third parties.” Isovska v Fitzpatrick, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025).
“Bazzi was a decision premised on an insurance contract, while Wilmore-Moody was based on a statutor y
third-party claim under MCL 500.3135(2)(c), but both used in part the same contract rescission principle to
resolve the respective disputes.” Isovska, ___ Mich App at ___. “In its discussion of the issue, the Wilmore-
Moody Court emphasized that, ‘while rescission is a legal fiction available as a contractual remedy for the
defrauded party, it does not alter reality or act as a DeLorean time machine.’” Id. at ___, quoting Wilmore-
Moody, 511 Mich at 86. “In other words, while Michigan courts are free to engage in . . . revisionist histor y
when granting rescission as a proper contractual remedy, that legal fiction does not actually create a n
alternate reality.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citations omitted) (holding that “as to the plaintiff, the
fact that a rescission between the parties took place subsequent to the accident did not result in th e
conclusion that the vehicle was uninsured at the time of the accident”).

Mich 17 (1982) (considering whether a party to a land contract wa s
entitled to rescission).
Legal rescission. In Meemic Ins Co v Fortson, 506 Mich 287, 310-311 n
19 (2020), the Michigan Supreme Court “acknowledged th e
existence of a legal—rather than equitable—rescission remedy,
but . . . noted that it was procedurally distinct and required th e
plaintiff to tender to the other party, as a precondition of suit,
specific restitution of everything received under the contract.” C-
Spine, ___ Mich at ___ n 25 (quotation marks omitted). However,
“rescission, whether legal or equitable, is governed by equitable
principles.” Van Dyke Spinal Rehab Ctr, PLLC v USA Underwriters, __ _
Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (noting “courts at law have considerable
discretion in granting rescission”) (cleaned up). “Because the legal
underpinnings of equitable rescission and rescission at law are the
same, logic dictates that the same rule apply in matters involving
rescission at law.” Id. at ___. “Thus, like equitable rescission,
rescission as a legal remedy is also not a matter of right, but rather i s
granted in the sound exercise of a trial judge’s discretion.” Id. at ___.
Standard of review. Questions about a trial court’s interpretation o f
an insurance contract and a trial court’s application of equitable
principles are reviewed de novo. Sherman, ___ Mich App at ___.
Accordingly, application of the equitable doctrine of rescission i s
also reviewed de novo. Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “But, the ultimate question of the appropriate remedy i s
reviewed for an abuse of discretion.” Id. at ___.
Case-by-case approach. There is no all-embracing rule governin g
rescission; “[e]ach case must stand on its own facts.” Dolecki v Perry,
277 Mich 679, 682 (1936). A case-by-case approach must also be
employed when determining whether rescission is equitable as t o
third parties; “‘an absolute approach would unduly hamper and
constrain the proper functioning of such remedies.’” Farm Burea u
Gen Ins Co v Ace American Ins Co, 337 Mich App 88, 99 (2021) ,
quoting Bazzi v Sentinel Ins Co, 502 Mich 390, 411 (2018).
Balancing the equities, reformation, and rescission. “Rescissio n
should not be granted in cases where the result thus obtained would
be unjust or inequitable.” Sherman, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned
up). “Courts should ‘balance the equities’ to determine whether
rescission is appropriate.” Id. at ___ (citation omitted). For instance,
reformation is “the appropriate remedy when an insurance contrac t
violates the law or public policy.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). “Similarly, reformation is possible if a party ca n
prove a mutual mistake of fact, or mistake on one side and fraud o n
the other, by clear and convincing evidence.” Id. at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). Reformation is also “available for
Page 9-52 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 505 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
contracts if the writing fails to express the intentions of the partie s
as the result of accident, inadvertence, mistake, fraud, or inequitable
conduct, or both fraud and mistake, fraud or inequitable conduc t
being on one side and mistake on the other.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
In contrast, “rescission is justified without regard to the intentional
nature of the misrepresentation, as long as it is relied upon by the
insurer.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“Applicability to third parties is what distinguishes rescission fro m
other remedies, like reformation.” C-Spine, ___ Mich at ___ n 26. Se e
Bazzi, 502 Mich at 412 n 12 (“If the insurer could not rescind as to the
third parties, but could rescind as to any claims by the fraudulen t
insured, then the policy would not be fully rescinded; rather i t
would be considered reformed.”).
Failure to perform or default. Rescission is an acceptable remedy
when there has been a failure to perform a substantial part of the
contract or one of its essential items, or where the parties would
have never created the contract had they expected or contemplated
the default that occurred. Adell Broadcasting Corp v Apex Media Sales,
Inc, 269 Mich App 6, 13-14 (2005).
Fraud. “A transfer induced by fraud or material misrepresentation is
subject to rescission and restitution.”McCallum v M 97 Auto Dealer,
Inc, ___ Mich App ___, ___ n 6 (2025) (quotation marks and citation
omitted). For more information regarding fraud as a basis for
unilateral rescission, see Section 9.6(K)(2).
Mutual mistake. “A contract may be rescinded because of a mutual
mistake of the parties[.]” Dingeman v Reffitt, 152 Mich App 350, 355
(1986). The determination of whether a party is “entitled t o
rescission [due to mutual mistake] involves a bifurcated inquiry: (1)
was there a mistaken belief entertained by one or both of the partie s
to a contract? and (2) if so, what is the legal significance of the
mistaken belief?” Id. “[R]escission is indicated when the mistake n
belief relates to a basic assumption of the parties upon which the
contract is made, and which materially affects the agreed
performances of the parties.” Lenawee Co Bd of Health, 417 Mich at 29.
However, “a party who has assumed the risk of loss in connectio n
with [a] mistake” is not entitled to rescission. Id. at 30.
Damages, rescission, and restitution. “Traditionally, the commo n
law required plaintiffs to elect between two inconsistent remedies:
affirm the contract and seek damages or disaffirm it and seek
restitution.” McCallum, ___ Mich App at ___ (noting that “Michigan,
however, has recognized a broader remedial regime”). “‘Under ou r
practice the law permits an action for damages with or withou t
rescission, and if with rescission a recovery of the purchase price wit h
interest and such additional damages as plaintiff may have suffered

=== Page 506 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
by reason of losses and expenses incurred in that connection whic h
were the natural and reasonable consequences of the fraud
perpetrated.’” Id. at ___, quoting Laubengayer v Rohde, 167 Mich 605,
612 (1911) (involving the sale of real property).
“When a contract is rescinded, the return of the purchase price is a
form of restitution.” McCallum, ___ Mich App at ___. “If it i s
restitution, then it is not damages, because the law consistently
treats damages and restitution as separate forms of relief.” Id. at ___.
“Damages is a remedy different in kind from rescission and
restitution.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Rescission, however, is no t
limited to restoring property received from another; it may als o
compensate the other for loss from related expenditure as justice
may require.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up) (“[c]onstruing a Laubengayer
recovery as a form of damages”). “Rescission of the parties’
exchange may leave the claimant with losses from related
expenditures (as distinct from payment of the price) made i n
reliance on the transaction that is being set aside.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Compensation of such los s
by an award of damages is not necessarily inconsistent with a n
award of restitution when the claimant’s basic entitlement is to be
restored to the status quo ante.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Damage s
measured by the claimant’s expenditure can be included in the
accounting that accompanies rescission, in order to do complete
justice in a single proceeding.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “Recovery of what are commonly called
‘incidental damages’ may thus be allowed in connection wit h
rescission, consistent with the remedial objective of restoring the
claimant to the precontractual position.” Id. at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted) (holding that “compensatory payments made
alongside an order of restitution are ‘incidental damages’”).
1. Mutual Rescission
“There are two types of rescission: mutual and unilateral. ”
Bradley v Westfield Ins Co, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024).
Because “a mutual rescission requires mutual intent, ”
“accepting consideration only binds the accepting party to a n
agreement if it has been made clear to the accepting party that,
by doing so, an agreement is formed.” Id. at ___ (noting that “ a
meeting of the minds” is required for “a valid cancellation o r
accord and satisfaction of an outstanding undertaking” )
(quotation marks and citation omitted). In Bradley, an insurer
sought to rescind a no-fault auto policy that “only allowe d
unilateral rescission due to fraud or misrepresentation.” Id. a t
___. The Bradley Court rejected the insurer’s argument that “ a
mutual rescission was implied by [the insured’s] acceptance o f
the check refunding her premiums” because “the letter that th e
Page 9-54 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 507 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
refund check accompanied unambiguously conveyed to [th e
insured] that [the insurer] had unilaterally decided to rescind
the policy and that there was nothing she could do about [it]. ”
Id. at ___. “The letter informed [the insured] that there had
been a unilateral rescission; it did not invite her to agree to a
mutual rescission.” Id. at ___. Indeed, “acceptance of
consideration is not an effective mutual rescission unless th e
receiving party is fully informed of the conditio n
accompanying acceptance.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). “There can be no severance of the conditio n
from acceptance.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). Accordingly, “mutual
rescissions must be based on proof that the insurer informed
the insured that cashing the check would constitute a mutual
rescission by which the insured would forfeit any right t o
dispute the lawfulness of the rescission.” Id. at ___. Therefore,
the Court concluded that “the rescission relied upon by
defendant was not mutual and that the claimed basis for a
unilateral rescission, i.e. fraud, cannot be shown.” Id. at __ _
(holding that the innocent-third party doctrine did not appl y
“because there was no rescission”).
“While courts may extend a mutual rescission to third partie s
as an equitable remedy, [an injured party] and her medical
providers cannot unilaterally declare a ‘rescission’ and appl y
its effects retroactively to ongoing litigation with third
parties.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive Mich Ins Co,
___ Mich ___, ___ (2025). “Even if [the injured party] and her
providers’ actions were sufficient to effect a mutual rescissio n
of the assignments, that rescission could not be given legal
effect as to a third party without a ruling from a court.” Id. a t
___. “Obviously, the effects of such a mutual rescission on the
parties’ obligations to each other are another matter.” Id. at __ _
n 27.
2. Unilateral Rescission
Fraud is a basis for unilateral rescission. See Ball v Sweeney, 354
Mich 616 (1958); see also Bradley v Westfield Ins Co, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2024) (“Because there was no fraud, there was n o
unilateral right of rescission.”). “Michigan’s law of fraud i s
summarized in Titan Ins Co v Hyten, 491 Mich 547 (2012), whic h
explains that ‘Michigan’s contract law recognizes several
interrelated but distinct common-law doctrines—loosel y
aggregated under the rubric of ‘fraud’—that may entitle a
party to a legal or equitable remedy if a contract is obtained a s
a result of fraud or misrepresentation.’” McCallum v M 97 Aut o
Dealer, Inc, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025), quoting Titan, 49 1
Mich at 555. “There are three types of misrepresentation s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-55
=== Page 508 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
which may entitle an insurer to rescind a policy: [A]ctionabl e
fraud, also known as fraudulent misrepresentation; innocen t
misrepresentation; and silent fraud, also known as fraudulen t
concealment.” Sherman v Progressive Mich Ins Co (On
Reconsideration), ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted) (stating that “‘an insurer has a
reasonable right to expect honesty in the application fo r
insurance’”) (citation omitted).
Fraudulent misrepresentation (actionable fraud). “Th e
elements of actionable fraud are: ‘(1) [t]hat defendant made a
material representation; (2) that it was false; (3) that when h e
made it he knew that it was false, or made it recklessly, withou t
any knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion; (4) tha t
he made it with the intention that it should be acted upon b y
plaintiff; (5) that plaintiff acted in reliance upon it; and (6) tha t
he thereby suffered injury.’” McCallum, ___ Mich App at ___,
quoting Titan, 491 Mich at 555 (citation omitted).
“In order to justify rescission of [personal injury protection ]
coverage with respect to preprocurement misrepresentations,
the insurer must be able to demonstrate common-law fraud
under equitable principles.” Bradley, ___ Mich App at __ _
(cleaned up).
“A failure to provide information that is not requested does no t
constitute a misrepresentation, let alone fraud.” Id. at ___. I n
Bradley, the insurer failed to produce any evidence suggesting
that the insured made a false representation where th e
insurer’s “application for insurance did not ask the applican t
who lived with her and whether there were other drivers in th e
household.” Id. at ___ (noting that the insurance applicatio n
did “not direct or ask the applicant to list the drivers in th e
household or even who lived in the household”). “Becaus e
there [was] no evidence of a misrepresentation,” the insure r
was “not entitled to rescind the contract on the basis of fraud. ”
Id. at ___.
“Fraud in the application for an insurance policy may allo w
the blameless contracting party to avoid its contractual
obligations” through the equitable remedy of rescission, whic h
“requires proof of a fraudulent misrepresentation that wa s
material.” Mota-Peguero v Falls Lake Nat’l Ins Co, ___ Mich Ap p
___, ___ (2024) (cleaned up). “Indeed, it is well settled that a n
insurer is entitled to rescind a policy ab initio on the basis of a
material misrepresentation made in an application for no-faul t
insurance.” Sherman, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). “The generally accepted test fo r
determining the materiality of a fact or matter as to which a
Page 9-56 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 509 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
representation is made to the insurer by an applicant fo r
insurance is to be found in the answer to the question whethe r
reasonably careful and intelligent underwriters would hav e
regarded the fact or matter, communicated at the time o f
effecting the insurance, as substantially increasing the chance s
of loss insured against so as to bring about a rejection of th e
risk or the charging of an increased premium.” Mota-Peguero,
___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“In other words, the proper materiality question is whethe r
‘the’ contract issued, at the specific premium rate agreed upon,
would have been issued notwithstanding the misrepresente d
facts.” Id. at ___ (holding that the insured’s “failure to disclose
that she used the vehicle to drive for Uber and Lyft was a
material misrepresentation”) (cleaned up); see also Sherman,
___ Mich App at ___ (“A misrepresentation is material if th e
insurer would have rejected the risk or charged an increased
premium and would not have issued the same contract had i t
been given the correct information.”).
“When addressing the intervening interests of parties othe r
than the fraudulent insured,” “rescission does not function b y
automatic operation of the law.” Mota-Peguero, ___ Mich Ap p
at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, “jus t
as rescission does not automatically apply to parties other tha n
the insured, rescission is likewise not barred as to thos e
parties.” Id. at ___. Instead, trial courts have an “obligation t o
balance the equities of rescission” when “faced with a direc t
claim by a provider[.]” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the trial cour t
“erred when it automatically dismissed [intervenin g
plaintiff’s] claim based on [the insured’s] material
misrepresentations.” Id. at ___. “By automatically awardin g
rescission to preclude [intervening plaintiff’s] claim, the trial
court failed to consider [intervening plaintiff’s] interests.” Id. a t
___ (remanding for the trial court to determine whether, in it s
discretion, rescission is available as between defendant an d
intervening plaintiff).
“A plaintiff alleging fraudulent misrepresentation mus t
demonstrate that reliance on the defendant’s representation s
was reasonable.” Gholston v Sherrill, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025). “There can be no fraud where a person has the means t o
determine that a representation is not true.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “A purchaser does not,
however, have an independent duty to investigate a seller’ s
affirmative representation.” Id. at ___. In Gholston, defendants
sold their home to plaintiffs without disclosing that the
carcinogen “trichloroethylene (TCE) was found in th e
surrounding groundwater.” Id. at ___ (noting that “defendant s
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-57
=== Page 510 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
checked ‘no’ in response to” a question on the Seller’ s
Disclosure Statement (SDS) asking if they were aware of any
environmental problems, such as contaminated soil, on th e
property). Plaintiffs did not find out about the contamination
until they were moving in, and thereafter sued defendant s
“alleging violation of the seller disclosure act, fraudulen t
misrepresentation, and silent fraud; as remedy, they sough t
rescission of the purchase agreement.” Id. at ___. On appeal,
the Gholston Court held that there was “a genuine issue of
material fact on whether it was reasonable for plaintiffs to rel y
on defendants’ representation that there was no environmental
hazard associated with the subject property.” Id. at __ _
(“nothing . . . suggest[ed] that plaintiffs were actually aware of
any information about the TCE contamination”). “As for
whether they reasonably should have known, defendants did
affirmatively represent that there were no know n
environmental hazards associated with the property; so,
defendants certainly did not put plaintiffs on notice t o
investigate further.” Id. at ___. “As for what was publicl y
available, there [was] evidence that even defendants ha d
trouble identifying the relevant information . . . .” Id. at ___.
“Contamination of groundwater below a home, when there i s
an actual, viable vector for the contaminate to migrate to th e
soil or air of the property, is an ‘environmental hazard’ [that ]
must be disclosed on the SDS prior to sale.” Id. at ___. While
“an inspector [possibly could] have found the monitoring sites,
the . . . record [did] not conclusively show that an inspectio n
would have given plaintiffs the same information tha t
defendants appear to have had about the hazard.” Id. at ___.
(holding that an “as is” clause does not “protect a seller fro m
refusing to disclose a known hazard”).
Innocent misrepresentation. “Rescission is justified in cases o f
innocent misrepresentation if a party relies upon th e
misstatement, because otherwise the party responsible for th e
misstatement would be unjustly enriched if he were not held
accountable for his misrepresentation.”Sherman, ___ Mich a t
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). “The part y
alleging innocent misrepresentation is not required to prov e
that the party making the misrepresentation intended t o
deceive or that the other party knew the representation wa s
false.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up).
In Sherman, an insurer notified its insured that it was denyin g
coverage and rescinding the policy ab initio because of
misrepresentations in her application. Id. at ___. In an affidavit,
the insurer’s litigation underwriting specialist alleged that th e
insurer relied on the insured’s misrepresentations and would
Page 9-58 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 511 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
have charged a 7.7% higher premium had the insure d
accurately disclosed the number of drivers and resident-
relatives at the reported address, and a 75.5% increased
premium had the insured disclosed her permanent address. Id.
at ___. Because the insured did not dispute this reliance, ther e
was “no genuine issue of material fact that [the insured] mad e
an innocent misrepresentation, and that [the insurer] would
have issued a different contract but for this misrepresentation. ”
Id. at ___. “The trial court, sitting in equity, should have nex t
examined [the insurer’s] conduct related to the procurement o f
the policy.” Id. at ___ (addressing “whether the trial cour t
properly ordered a reformation of the insurance contract”).
Indeed, the insured “did not allege bad faith or wrongdoing b y
[the insurer] prior to the rescission,” and “there was n o
evidence that [the insurer] engaged in misconduct in th e
procurement of the policy.” Id. at ___ (“In these circumstances,
Michigan jurisprudence has overwhelmingly held that court s
should uphold the insurer’s rescission.”). “The trial court’ s
balance of the equities should have revealed misconduct b y
[the insured], but none by [the insurer].” Id. at ___ (“The tria l
court erred by failing to recognize this distinction.”). “[T]h e
trial court’s decision to reform, rather than rescind, the policy ”
compounded this error. Id. at ___ (noting that the insure d
failed to request reformation in her demand for relief). “B y
ordering the policy reformed, the trial court placed th e
financial burden of paying PIP benefits on [the insurer],
notwithstanding the fact that [the insured] obtained those ver y
same benefits by way of fraud.” Id. at ___. Because “innocen t
insurers should not bear the burden of an insured’s fraud, ”
“the trial court abused its discretion when it ordere d
reformation, rather than rescission.” Id. at ___.
Silent fraud (fraudulent concealment). Under the doctrine of
silent fraud, “when there is a legal or equitable duty o f
disclosure, a fraud arising from the suppression of the truth i s
as prejudicial as that which springs from the assertion of a
falsehood.” McCallum, ___ Mich App at ___ (cleaned up).
3. Innocent Third Parties
“In both Wilmore-Moody[ v Zakir, 511 Mich 76 (2023), and Bazz i
v Sentinel Ins Co, 502 Mich 390 (2018), the [Michigan Supreme]
Court recognized that the voiding ab initio of a contract, as a
result of rescission, is a legal fiction that alters the lega l
relations between the contracting parties, but not necessaril y
third parties.” Isovska v Fitzpatrick, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2025) (“Bazzi was a decision premised on an insuranc e
contract, while Wilmore-Moody was based on a statutory third-

=== Page 512 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
party claim under MCL 500.3135(2)(c), but both used in par t
the same contract rescission principle to resolve the respectiv e
disputes.”). “Bazzi held that a no-fault policy may be rescinded
as to an innocent third party if the trial court, after balancin g
the relevant equities, decides that remedy is warranted. ”
Isovska, ___ Mich App at ___, citing Bazzi, 502 Mich at 410-411 .
In Pioneer State Mut Ins Co v Wright, 331 Mich App 396, 410-411
(2020), the Michigan Supreme Court “adopted a nonexclusive
list of factors . . . that trial courts may consider in balancing th e
equities between two innocent parties.” Isovska, ___ Mich App
at ___ (citation omitted). Factors to consider when balancin g
the equities include
“‘(1) the extent to which the insurer could have
uncovered the subject matter of the fraud before
the innocent third party was injured; (2) the
relationship between the fraudulent insured and
the innocent third party to determine if the third
party had some knowledge of the fraud; (3) the
nature of the innocent third party’s conduct,
whether reckless or negligent, in the injury-causing
event; (4) the availability of an alternate avenue for
recovery if the insurance policy is not enforced;
and (5) a determination of whether policy
enforcement only serves to relieve the fraudulen t
insured of what would otherwise be the fraudulen t
insured’s personal liability to the innocent third
party.’” [Isovska, ___ Mich App at ___, quotin g
Pioneer, 331 Mich App at 411.]
Accordingly, “an insurer’s rescission of an insurance policy—
which results in a denial of benefits to an insured or covered
party—does not necessarily extend to third parties, such a s
medical providers.” C-Spine Orthopedics, PLLC v Progressive
Mich Ins Co, ___ Mich ___, ___ n 22 (2025). “Rather, becaus e
rescission is an equitable remedy, the equities must b e
balanced.” Id. at ___. Thus, “regardless of the basis for seekin g
the remedy of rescission,” “trial courts are required to balanc e
the equities between a defrauded insurer and an innocent thir d
party before extending the mutual rescission of a no-faul t
insurance policy to an innocent third party.” Van Dyke Spina l
Rehab Ctr, PLLC v USA Underwriters, ___ Mich App ___, __ _
(2024).
In Van Dyke, a medical provider brought a direct action agains t
an insurer that had rescinded its policy based on a materia l
misrepresentation made by its insured in an application for no-
fault insurance. Van Dyke, ___ Mich App at ___ (observing tha t
“not only was it permissible for the trial court in this case t o
Page 9-60 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 513 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.6
engage in a balancing of the equities, it was required.”).
Regarding the first factor, “had defendant exercised du e
diligence, the insured’s misrepresentations would have bee n
discovered long before the accident occurred and the polic y
would have been rescinded before plaintiff provided an y
services to the insured.” Id. at ___ (noting “the right to rescind
a contract can be waived by inexcusable delay” and “rescissio n
must be claimed promptly”). Regarding the second factor,
“there is no reason to believe that plaintiff was aware of [th e
insured’s] fraud until, after providing services for several
months, defendant finally got around to rescinding the polic y
and denying plaintiff’s claims.” Id. at ___. Regarding the third
factor, “not only was plaintiff not aware of [the insured’s ]
misrepresentation when they began providing services,
plaintiff was not made aware of it when defendant actuall y
rescinded the policy.” Id. at ___. Regarding the fourth factor,
“plaintiff could recover its outstanding bills from either [th e
insured] or the Michigan Assigned Claims Facility.” Id. at ___.
Regarding the fifth factor, “denying rescission in favor o f
plaintiff might prompt the insurer to timely attend to its ow n
responsibilities”—“[h]ad defendant acted with reasonabl e
promptness, plaintiff would have provided significantly les s
services or possibly even none at all.” Id. at ___. “In sum, . . . a
balancing of the equities weighs heavily in favor of denyin g
rescission,” and “the trial court correctly weighed the equitie s
in favor of plaintiff.” Id. at ___.
“[A]n insurer’s decision to deny claims because of a purported
rescission is not justification for withholding payment whe n
the injured party is not involved in the fraud.” VHS of Mich, In c
v Mich Auto Ins Placement Facility, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025).
In VHS, the Court of Appeals held that an insurance compan y
and its insured could not, without court involvement, “rescind
a policy of insurance on the basis of fraud such that n o
payment could be made under the policy after an acciden t
involving an innocent third party.” Id. at ___ (noting tha t
“rescission of a contract is a remedy reserved to the sound
discretion of the trial court”). “[T]he fact that [the insurer]
believed it could rescind the policy did not absolve itself of
making payment first and later determining which insurer wa s
ultimately obligated to pay.” Id. at ___. The VHS Court rejected
the insurer’s “argument that it did not fail to pay within 3 0
days of receiving proof of loss because it paid within 30 days o f
the trial court’s ruling on the issue of rescission.” Id. at ___.
“This argument ignores the principle that rescission is a
remedy ordered by a court, not unilaterally chosen by a n
insurance company.” Id. at ___ (“This is particularly true here,
where an innocent third party . . . is the individual affected by
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-61
=== Page 514 ===
Section 9.6 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
[the insurer’s] decision.”). Moreover, because the innocen t
third party “was innocent in the purported fraud by [th e
vehicle owner], [the insurer] also should have known that i t
could not simply rescind the policy unilaterally with [th e
vehicle owner]—in effect, pull the rug out from under [th e
innocent third party’s] feet—to avoid its obligations under th e
policy.” Id. at ___ (noting that “there was no question that [the]
innocent third party . . . was entitled to PIP benefits from an
insurer, the only question was which insurer would ultimately
be responsible”). “Allowing gamesmanship like that played by
[the insurer] would incentivize insurers to delay or withhold
payment on their own belief that they are entitled to avoid th e
requirements of the no-fault act by entering into collateral
agreements with their insureds.” Id. at ___ (“[The insurer]
could have paid the claims under a reservation that should th e
policy be rescinded, another insurance company would
eventually make it whole for those payments made while th e
issue of rescission was determined.”).
4. Burden of Proof
There is a contradiction in the caselaw on the burden of proo f
for rescission based on fraud. See Mina v Gen Star Indemnity Co,
218 Mich App 678, 681-685 (1996), rev’d in part on othe r
30
grounds 455 Mich 866 (1997). In recognizing this conflict, th e
Michigan Court of Appeals stated:
“[W]e are unable to say with any degree of
certainty exactly what standard of proof court s
should apply in fraud cases. The Supreme Cour t
has alternately required fraud to be established by
a preponderance of the evidence and by clear and
convincing proof, with little consistency and n o
detailed analysis. While the most recent Supreme
Court pronouncements regarding the questio n
have stated that fraud must be proved by clear and
convincing evidence, we think it unlikely that the
Supreme Court would overrule a significant body
of case law without at least mentioning that it wa s
doing so.” Mina, 218 Mich App at 684-685.
Examples of cases that required fraud to be proven by a
preponderance of the evidence include Hayes v Weitzel, 25 1
Mich 129, 130 (1930); Campbell v Great Lakes Ins Co, 228 Mich
636, 641 (1924); and Stein v Home-Owners Ins Co, 303 Mich Ap p

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.7
382 (2013). Cases that indicate a clear and convincing burden o f
proof include Flynn v Korneffel, 451 Mich 186, 201 (1996); and
Foodland Distrib v Al-Naimi, 220 Mich App 453, 459 (1996).
L. Standard of Review
“When reviewing a grant of equitable relief, an appellate court will
set aside a trial court’s factual findings only if they are clearly
erroneous, but whether equitable relief is proper under those facts i s
a question of law that [is] . . . review[ed] de novo.” McDonald v Farm
Bureau Ins Co, 480 Mich 191, 197 (2008).
9.7 Injunctive Relief
Injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy that should only be granted
when justice requires, when no adequate legal remedy exists, and whe n
there is a real and imminent danger of irreparable injury. Pontiac Fire
Fighters Union Local 376 v Pontiac, 482 Mich 1, 8 (2008).
“In cases in which an irreparable injury will result from the acts of publi c
officials in attempting to proceed under an invalid law, the jurisdiction o f
equity may be invoked for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief and
a determination as to the constitutionality of the statute that is involved.”
Reeves v Wayne Co, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). Accordingly, “courts may not enjoin criminal
prosecutions unless public officials are proceeding under an invalid law,
and the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm as a result.” Id. at ___
(recognizing a “narrow exception” to the rule “that criminal prosecutions
are generally not subject to injunctive relief”).
A. Temporary Restraining Order (TRO)
A TRO may be granted without notice to the adverse party if th e
following conditions are satisfied:
“(a) it clearly appears from specific facts shown b y
affidavit or by a verified complaint that immediate an d
irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to th e
applicant from the delay required to effect notice o r
from the risk that notice will itself precipitate adverse
action before an order can be issued;
(b) the applicant’s attorney certifies to the court i n
writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to giv e
the notice and the reasons supporting the claim tha t
notice should not be required; and
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-63
=== Page 516 ===
Section 9.7 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(c) a permanent record or memorandum is made of an y
nonwritten evidence, argument, or othe r
representations made in support of the application. ”
MCR 3.310(B)(1)(a)-(c).
A TRO granted without notice must:
“(a) be endorsed with the date and time of issuance;
(b) describe the injury and state why it is irreparabl e
and why the order was granted without notice;
(c) except in domestic relations actions, set a date fo r
hearing at the earliest possible time on the motion for a
preliminary injunction or order to show cause why a
preliminary injunction should not be issued.” MCR
3.310(B)(2)(a)-(c).
“In order to establish irreparable injury, the moving party mus t
demonstrate a noncompensable injury for which there is no legal
measurement of damages or for which damages cannot be
determined with a sufficient degree of certainty. The injury must be
both certain and great, and it must be actual rather than theoretical.
Economic injuries are not irreparable because they can be remedied
by damages at law.” Thermatool Corp v Borzym, 227 Mich App 366,
377 (1998) (internal citations omitted).
“Before granting a . . . temporary restraining order, the court may
require the applicant to give security, in the amount the court deem s
proper, for the payment of costs and damages that may be incurred
or suffered by a party who is found to have been wrongfully
enjoined or restrained.” MCR 3.310(D)(1).
B. Preliminary Injunction
The moving party has the burden of establishing that a preliminary
injunction should issue. MCR 3.310(A)(4).
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the parties’
status quo. Bratton v DAIIE, 120 Mich App 73, 79 (1982). The Cour t
of Appeals summarized the reason behind the purpose and how i t
should apply to parties seeking a preliminary injunction:
“The object of a preliminary injunction is to preserve th e
status quo, so that upon the final hearing the rights o f
the parties may be determined without injury to either.
The status quo which will be preserved by a
preliminary injunction is the last actual, peaceable,
noncontested status which preceded the pendin g

=== Page 517 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.7
controversy. The injunction should not be issued if th e
party seeking it fails to show that it will suffe r
irreparable injury if the injunction is not issued.
Furthermore, a preliminary injunction will not be issue d
if it will grant one of the parties all the relief requested
prior to a hearing on the merits. Finally, a preliminar y
injunction should not be issued where the party seekin g
it has an adequate remedy at law.” Bratton, 120 Mic h
App at 79 (internal citations omitted).
The court should consider four factors in determining whether t o
grant a preliminary injunction:
(1) whether the injunction would harm the publi c
interest;
(2) whether the harm to the plaintiff in the absence of a
stay would outweigh the harm to the defendant if th e
stay is granted;
(3) whether the plaintiff is likely to succeed on th e
merits; and
(4) whether the plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if a
preliminary injunction is denied. Michigan State Em p
Ass’n v Dep’t of Mental Health, 421 Mich 152, 157-158
(1984).
A party seeking a preliminary injunction “bears the burden of
proving that the traditional four elements favor the issuance of a
preliminary injunction.” Detroit Fire Fighters Ass’n, IAFF Local 344 v
Detroit, 482 Mich 18, 34 (2008).
“In order to establish irreparable injury, the moving party mus t
demonstrate a noncompensable injury for which there is no legal
measurement of damages or for which damages cannot be
determined with a sufficient degree of certainty. The injury must be
both certain and great, and it must be actual rather than theoretical.
Economic injuries are not irreparable because they can be remedied
by damages at law.” Thermatool Corp v Borzym, 227 Mich App 366,
377 (1998) (internal citations omitted).
“Before granting a preliminary injunction . . . the court may require
the applicant to give security, in the amount the court deems proper,
for the payment of costs and damages that may be incurred or
suffered by a party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined
or restrained.” MCR 3.310(D)(1).
If a preliminary injunction is granted, “[t]he trial of the action on the
merits must be held within 6 months after the injunction is granted,
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-65
=== Page 518 ===
Section 9.8 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
unless good cause is shown or the parties stipulate to a longer
period.” MCR 3.310(A)(5). The court must issue a decision on the
merits within 56 days after completion of the trial. Id.
C. Permanent Injunction
A party requesting a permanent injunction has a heavier burden of
proof than a party requesting a preliminary injunction. Barkau v
Ruggirello, 100 Mich App 617, 623 (1980). The plaintiff “‘must prove
by a preponderance of the evidence actual or threatened invasion of
his rights as alleged. Proof of mere apprehension of injury i s
insufficient to justify granting injunctive relief.’” Id., quoting Dutc h
Cookie Machine Co v Vande Vrede, 289 Mich 272, 280 (1939).
D. Form of Injunction
Every injunction and restraining order must state why it was issued ,
be specific as to its terms, and describe in reasonable detail the act s
restrained. MCR 3.310(C)(1)-(3). Reference cannot be made to an y
other document to describe the acts restrained. MCR 3.310(C).
Injunctions and restraining orders are “binding only on the partie s
to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and
attorneys, and on those persons in active concert or participatio n
with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service
or otherwise.” MCR 3.310(C)(4).
E. Standard of Review
“When reviewing a grant of equitable relief, an appellate court will
set aside a trial court’s factual findings only if they are clearly
erroneous, but whether equitable relief is proper under those facts i s
a question of law that an appellate court reviews de novo.”
McDonald v Farm Bureau Ins Co, 480 Mich 191, 197 (2008).
9.8 Interpleader
“Interpleader actions are equitable in nature” and “save a party fro m
having to defend multiple suits seeking the same property or limited
fund.” Secura Ins Co v Stamp, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2022). Interpleader
actions “are governed by MCR 3.603, which provides that ‘[p]erson s
having claims against the plaintiff may be joined as defendants and
required to interplead when their claims are such that the plaintiff is o r
may be exposed to double or multiple liability.’” Id. at ___ (citing MCR
3.603(A)(1); alteration in original). “It is not a ground for objection to the
joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which thei r
claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical, but ar e

=== Page 519 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.9
adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff denie s
liability to any or all of the claimants in whole or in part.” MCR
3.603(A)(1).
The provisions of MCR 3.603 supplement MCR 2.206, and do not limit
the permissive joinder of parties. MCR 2.603(C). See Section 3.2 for mor e
information on joinder.
A defendant exposed to liability may obtain interpleader b y
counterclaim or cross-claim. MCR 3.603(A)(2). “A claimant not already
before the court may be joined as [a] defendant, as provided in MCR
2.207 or MCR 2.209.” MCR 3.603(A)(2).
“The court may award actual costs to an interpleader plaintiff.” MCR
3.603(E).
9.9 Mandamus
A. Purpose
A writ of mandamus directs a public official to perform his or her
legal duty. Jones v Dep’t of Corrections, 468 Mich 646, 658 (2003). A
writ of mandamus cannot be sought to “control the exercise or
direction of the discretion to be exercised,” or “for the purpose of
reviewing, revising, or controlling the exercise of discretion reposed
in administrative bodies.” Teasel v Dep’t of Mental Health, 419 Mic h
390, 409-410 (1984).
B. Issuance
“Unless the constitution, a statute, or court rule requires an actio n
for mandamus against a state officer to be brought in the Supreme
Court, the action must be brought in the Court of Appeals or the
Court of Claims.”MCR 3.305(A)(1). “All other actions for mandamu s
must be brought in the circuit court unless a statute or rule require s
or allows the action to be brought in another court.” MCR
3.305(A)(2).
“The general venue statutes and rules apply to actions for
mandamus unless a specific statute or rule contains a special venue
31
provision.” MCR 3.305(B)(1). “In addition to any other county i n
which venue is proper, an action for mandamus against a state
officer may be brought in Ingham County.” MCR 3.305(B)(2).
31See Section 2.14 for information on venue.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-67

Section 9.9 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
“To obtain the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus, the
plaintiff must show that (1) the plaintiff has a clear, legal right t o
performance of the specific duty sought, (2) the defendant has a
clear legal duty to perform, (3) the act is ministerial, and (4) no other
adequate legal or equitable remedy exists that might achieve the
same result.” Citizens for Higgins Lake Legal Levels v Roscommon Co B d
of Comm’rs, 341 Mich App 161, 178-179 (2022) (quotation marks and
citation omitted). The party seeking mandamus has the burden o f
proving all four requirements. See Rental Props Owners Ass’n of Ken t
Co v Kent Co Treasurer, 308 Mich App 498, 518 (2014). “Mandamus i s
an extraordinary writ and it will not lie to review or control the
exercise of discretion vested in a public official or administrative
body.” Citizens, 341 Mich App at 178 (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted); see also Barrow v Wayne Co Bd of Canvassers, 341 Mich Ap p
473, 488 (2022) (“[M]andamus may lie to compel the exercise of
discretion, but not to compel its exercise in a particular manner.”)
(citation and quotation marks omitted).
Clear Legal Right. “[A] clear legal right is one clearly founded in, o r
granted by, law; a right which is inferable as a matter of law fro m
uncontroverted facts regardless of the difficulty of the legal questio n
to be decided.” Rental Props Owners Ass’n of Kent Co, 308 Mich App
at 519 (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Even where such a
right can be shown, it has long been the policy of the courts to deny
the writ of mandamus to compel the performance of public dutie s
by public officials unless the specific right involved is not possessed
by citizens generally.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Clear Legal Duty. “A clear legal duty, like a clear legal right, is on e
that is inferable as a matter of law from uncontroverted fact s
regardless of the difficulty of the legal question to be decided.”
Hayes v Parole Bd, 312 Mich App 774, 782 (2015) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted). See Braddock v Parole Bd, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2024) (“[P]laintiff ha[d] a right and defendant ha[d] a duty t o
provide a majority vote on whether to grant or deny plaintiff
parole.”); see also Neilson v Bd of State Canvassers, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2024) (although the Board had a statutory “duty to investigat e
signatures or to check signatures against the qualified voter file,” it
“did not have a clear legal duty to accept and review the last-second
submissions by plaintiff” or “conduct a review of plaintiff’ s
choosing or one that adheres to the parameters she sets”).
Ministerial Acts. “An act is ministerial in nature if it is prescribed
and defined by law with such precision and certainty as to leave
nothing to the exercise of discretion or judgment.” Carter v An n
Arbor City Attorney, 271 Mich App 425, 439 (2006) (quotation mark s
and citation omitted) (concluding the act of hiring an assistant city
attorney was discretionary and thus, not ministerial). See als o
Page 9-68 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 521 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.9
Braddock, ___ Mich App at ___ (“While the decision whether to gran t
parole is clearly discretionary, the act of voting is itself
ministerial.”). Compare with Coalition for a Safer Detroit v Detroit Cit y
Clerk, 295 Mich App 362, 371 (2012), where it was determined tha t
placing an initiative petition (that satisfied signature requirements)
on the ballot was a ministerial act. Thus, the city clerk and electio n
commission improperly exercised their discretion and judgment by
considering the substance of the initiative when voting to exclude
the initiative from the ballot. Id. See also Berdy v Buffa, 504 Mich 876,
879 (2019) (removing the names of properly challenged contestant s
from a ballot is a ministerial act); see also Neilson, ___ Mich App at
___ (“Because the Board has discretion as to how to conduct it s
review of petition signatures and as to the procedure that it will
employ, the act that plaintiff seeks to compel in this case is no t
ministerial.”).
Other Adequate Remedy. “[The] plaintiff lack[ed] an adequat e
legal or equitable remedy that might achieve the same result a s
mandamus” where “[a]lthough a writ of quo warranto might have
been an appropriate remedy . . . , before seeking such a writ,
plaintiff would have been forced to seek ‘special leave of the court.’”
Berry v Garrett, 316 Mich App 37, 45 (2016) (concluding that,
“[g]iven the time constraints and procedural limitations, . . . qu o
warranto was [not] an adequate remedy to achieve the same resul t
that plaintiff could achieve by utilizing mandamus”) (citatio n
omitted). See also Braddock, ___ Mich App at ___ (holding tha t
“plaintiff met this burden [of showing entitlement to the
extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus] with respect t o
requiring a revote” because “plaintiff [was] entitled to have a parol e
decision made based upon a majority vote by the Parole Board” and
“defendant ha[d] not shown what other remedy could be
provided”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
Mootness. “A writ of mandamus is unnecessary when th e
underlying issue becomes moot.” CB v Livingston Co Communit y
Mental Health, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2023). “Mandamus is a
remedy of extraordinary power, but narrowly defined usage.” Id. a t
___. Accordingly, “a writ of mandamus will not be issued to compel
the doing of a useless thing or if the question is moot and the
granting of a writ of mandamus would serve no purpose.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up). In CB, ___ Mich App at ___, the Court of Appeals
concluded that “issuing the writ would serve no purpose” because
the defendant “eventually began providing at home respite care
services during the pendency of [the] appeal”—“[i]n other words,
there [was] nothing left to compel.” Because neither the Court of
Appeals nor the trial court could “fashion a remedy related to the
complaint for mandamus, the question of the propriety of the trial
court’s denial of the writ [was] moot.” Id. at ___.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-69
=== Page 522 ===
Section 9.10 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
C. Standard of Review
The decision to grant or deny a writ of mandamus is reviewed for
an abuse of discretion. Rental Props Owners Ass’n of Kent Co v Kent Co
Treasurer, 308 Mich App 498, 518 (2014). However, the court review s
de novo the first two elements required for issuance of a writ of
mandamus: that the official in question has a clear legal duty t o
perform and that the plaintiff has a clear legal right to performance
of that duty. Id.
D. Damages
MCL 600.4431 “authoriz[es] money damages in mandamu s
actions,” and “[a]lthough damages under MCL 600.4431 are not
conditioned on successfully obtaining the writ of mandamus, the y
are tethered to the merits of the underlying mandamus action.” CB v
Livingston Co Community Mental Health, ___ Mich App ___, ___
(2023). “In other words, to obtain damages under MCL 600.4431, a
plaintiff must have a meritorious claim seeking a writ of mandamu s
in the first place—even if it is subsequently rendered moot.” CB, __ _
Mich App at ___. “[I]t is immaterial to the question of damages tha t
[defendant] eventually began providing services”—“[h]olding
otherwise would allow defendants to evade damages solely by
complying with their legal duties after a plaintiff filed suit, bu t
before a trial court decides whether to issue the writ.” Id. at ___. I n
CB, “[t]he trial court’s decision on mandamus did not resolve the
issue of damages for past noncompliance, or the noncompliance
related to respite services that continued well into th[e] appeal”;
“[t]he trial court therefore erred by failing to address [plaintiff’s]
request for damages under MCL 600.4431.” CB, ___ Mich App at __ _
(remanding “for the trial court to determine whether plaintiff i s
entitled to damages pursuant to MCL 600.4431 and the extent o f
those damages if any”).
9.10 Superintending Control
A. Purpose
An order of superintending control enforces the supervisory power
of a court over lower courts or tribunals. MCR 3.302(A).
B. Extraordinary Remedy
“Superintending control is an extraordinary power that may be
invoked when the plaintiff demonstrates the defendant’s failure t o
Page 9-70 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 523 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.10
perform a clear legal duty and the absence of an adequate legal
remedy.” In re Gosnell, 234 Mich App 326, 341 (1999).
Availability of an appeal or another remedy will defeat a writ of
superintending control. MCR 3.302(B); MCR 3.302(D)(2). However,
superintending control is not precluded if an appeal is available bu t
not adequate. In re Hague, 412 Mich 532, 546 (1982).
If a party does not have standing to appeal, superintending control
may be a proper remedy. Michigan State Police v 33rd Dist Court, 13 8
Mich App 390, 394 (1984).
C. Validity
An order of superintending control entered by a court with proper
jurisdiction must be obeyed even if clearly incorrect. In re Hague, 412
Mich 532, 545 (1982).
D. Limitations
MCL 600.2963(8), which requires a prisoner to pay outstanding fee s
and costs before commencing a new civil action or appeal, “canno t
constitutionally be applied to bar a complaint for superintending
control over an underlying criminal case if the bar is based o n
outstanding fees owed by an indigent-prisoner plaintiff from a n
earlier case and the prisoner-plaintiff lacks funds to pay those
outstanding fees.” In re Jackson (On Remand), 326 Mich App 629, 631-
632 (2018). When dealing with “criminal cases,” there is a “‘fla t
prohibition’ . . . against making access to ‘appellate processes’ tur n
on the ability to pay.” Id. at 635, citing MLB v SLJ, 519 US 102, 11 2
(1996). “[A] complaint for superintending control over a n
underlying criminal case must reasonably be recognized as a n
‘appellate process,’ . . . even though it is an original civil action, and
not formally an appeal[.]” Jackson, 326 Mich App at 637 (although
the claim for superintending control was “recognized as criminal i n
nature for purposes of the federal constitutional right of access t o
the courts,” the claim remained classified “as an original civil actio n
subject to the fee-related requirements of MCL 600.2963 (apart fro m
an unconstitutional application of MCL 600.2963(8))”).
Superintending control may not be used to permanently enjoi n
someone from holding a judicial office. In re Evan Callanan Sr, 419
Mich 376, 388 (1984).
E. Parties
Although a judge may be a nominal defendant in a case seeking a n
order of superintending control, the judge is not an aggrieved party,
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-71
=== Page 524 ===
Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
and thus has no standing to appeal an order of superintending
control. Wayne Co Prosecutor v Recorder’s Court Judge, 66 Mich Ap p
315, 316 (1975).
F. Standard of Review
“The grant or denial of a petition for superintending control i s
within the sound discretion of the court.” In re Goehring, 184 Mic h
App 360, 366 (1990).
9.11 Medical Malpractice
“[A] medical malpractice claim is one brought against someone who, o r
an entity that, is capable of malpractice, involving actions that occurred
within the course of a professional relationship, and which rais e
questions involving medical judgment rather than issues that are withi n
the common knowledge and experience of the fact-finder.” Meyers v
Rieck, 509 Mich 460, 469 (2022) (cleaned up). For example, “if a nurse fail s
to take any action to address a known problem or hazardous condition,
then the claim might sound in ordinary negligence.” Id. at 469. “But a
claim that concerns the failure to monitor and assess risks to a patient . . .
usually requires specialized medical knowledge and therefore sounds i n
medical malpractice.” Id. at 470. However, “a defendant’s violation of it s
own internal rule, even if the rule is designed to protect the public, doe s
not constitute negligence per se.” Id. at 473. “Accordingly, a claim tha t
defendant committed malpractice merely by violating its own internal
rule or regulation, without more, must fail because that rule or regulatio n
does not establish the applicable standard of care.” Id. at 477.
Generally, a medical malpractice plaintiff has two years from the time hi s
or her claim accrues to commence an action. Driver v Naini, 490 Mich 239,
249 (2011). A medical malpractice action begins when “a timely served
complaint is filed.” Ottgen v Katranji, 511 Mich 223, 245 (2023) (“the
normal tolling rules apply to medical malpractice actions, and tollin g
occurs upon the filing of a timely served complaint”). “A medical
malpractice action can only be commenced by filing a timely [notice o f
intent under MCL 600.2912b] and then filing a complaint and an affidavi t
of merit after the applicable notice period has expired, but before th e
period of limitations has expired.” Tyra v Organ Procurement Agency o f
Mich, 498 Mich 68, 94 (2015).
The following subsections discuss the procedural aspects of commencin g
a medical malpractice action. For information on expert witnesses i n
medical malpractice actions, see the Evidence Benchbook, Chapter 4.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
A. Statute of Limitations
Generally, plaintiff has two years from the time his or her clai m
accrues to commence a medical malpractice action. Driver v Naini,
490 Mich 239, 249 (2011); MCL 600.5805(8). A claim accrues “‘at th e
time of the act or omission that is the basis for the claim . . . ,
regardless of the time the plaintiff discovers or otherwise ha s
knowledge of the claim.’” Driver, 490 Mich at 249, quoting MCL
600.5838a(1).
For purposes of the statute of limitations in a medical malpractice
case, “the [claim] accrual date depends on the date of the specific ac t
or omission that the plaintiff claims caused his or her injury.”
Kincaid v Cardwell, 300 Mich App 513, 525 (2013). However, a
plaintiff is not limited “to asserting a single claim for medical
malpractice for any given injury.” Id. “Because a plaintiff’s injur y
can be causally related to multiple acts or omissions, it is possible
for the plaintiff to allege multiple claims of malpractice premised o n
discrete acts or omissions—even when those acts or omissions lead
to a single injury—and those claims will have independent accrual
dates determined by the date of the specific act or omission a t
issue.” Id. However, “courts cannot permit a plaintiff to revive the
[common law] last-treatment rule [which the Legislature abrogated
for medical malpractice claims, 1986 PA 178,] by merely pleading
that the defendant had an ‘on-going’ or ‘continuing’ duty to ac t
throughout the duration of the patient-physician relationship.” Id.
at 528. “In order to establish that continued adherence to an initial
diagnosis or treatment plan constitutes a discrete act or omission o n
a date after the date when the initial diagnosis or plan was adopted,
the plaintiff must plead—and be able to prove—facts that would
establish that the continued adherence at the later point constituted
a breach of the duty owed to the plaintiff.” Id. at 530-531.
A medical malpractice action begins when “a timely served
complaint is filed.” Ottgen v Katranji, 511 Mich 223, 245 (2023).
“Filing an [affidavit of merit] under MCL 600.2912d(1) is no t
required to commence a medical malpractice action and toll th e
statutory limitations period.” Ottgen, 511 Mich at 228 (“failure t o
comply with MCL 600.2912d(1) can still be a basis for dismissal of a
case—just not on statute-of-limitations grounds”).
“The statute of limitations was tolled” while plaintiffs’ “motion t o
amend complaint and add party defendants was pending” because
plaintiffs “demonstrated due diligence by seeking a decision o n
their motion within three weeks.” Charpentier v Young, 403 Mich 85 1
(1978). “As long as the plaintiff demonstrate[s] due diligence, the
running of the limitations periods [are] tolled as a matter of course.”
Steele v Winfield, 343 Mich App 394, 396 (2022) (quotation marks an d
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-73
=== Page 526 ===
Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
citation omitted). In Steele, the plaintiff “moved to file an amended
complaint within the statutory limitations period and thus tolled
the running of that period until the circuit court made its decision”
and “then filed his amended complaint before the statutory
limitations period expired.” Id. at 404, 405. The Steele Cour t
concluded that “[t]his was due diligence” and the “defendants were
not entitled to the dismissal of the claims against them.” Id. at 405.
B. Notice of Intent
Generally, a person alleging medical malpractice may no t
commence an action against a health professional or a health facility
until he or she “has given the health professional or health facility
written notice under [MCL 600.2912b] not less than 182 days befor e
32
the action is commenced.” MCL 600.2912b(1). This notice i s
commonly referred to as a notice of intent or NOI. “[T]he purpose of
the NOI is simply to give advance notice of the claim being made by
the plaintiff to facilitate potential settlement.” Sanders v McLaren-
Macomb, 323 Mich App 254, 268 (2018).
The 182-day notice period may be shortened to 91 days “if all of the
following conditions exist:
(a) The claimant has previously filed the 182-day notic e
required in [MCL 600.2912b(1)] against other healt h
professionals or health facilities involved in the claim.
(b) The 182-day notice period has expired as to th e
health professionals or health facilities described i n
[MCL 600.2912b(3)(a)].
(c) The claimant has filed a complaint and commence d
an action alleging medical malpractice against 1 or mor e
of the health professionals or health facilities described
in [MCL 600.2912b(3)(a)].
(d) The claimant did not identify, and could no t
reasonably have identified a health professional o r
health facility to which notice must be sent under [MCL
600.2912b(1)] as a potential party to the action before
filing the complaint.” MCL 600.2912b(3).
MCL 600.2912b(1) requires that a plaintiff satisfy two conditions:
“(1) submit an NOI to every health professional or health
facility before filing a complaint and
32See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Period of Notice of Intent Flowchart.

=== Page 527 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
(2) wait the applicable notice waiting period wit h
respect to each defendant before he or she ca n
commence an action.” Driver v Naini, 490 Mich 239, 25 5
(2011).
1. Filing and Serving the NOI (Timeliness)
The statutory requirement that a plaintiff file a timely NOI i s
“a prerequisite condition to the commencement of a medica l
malpractice lawsuit,” and “the failure to comply with th e
statutory requirement renders the complaint insufficient t o
33
commence the action.” Driver v Naini, 490 Mich 239, 257
(2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
MCL 600.2912b(2) requires that the NOI “be mailed to the las t
known professional business address or residential address o f
the health professional or health facility who is the subject o f
the claim.” “Proof of the mailing constitutes prima faci e
evidence of compliance[.]” If the last known address cannot b e
reasonably ascertained, “notice may be mailed to the healt h
facility where the care that is the basis of the claim wa s
rendered.” Id.
“When a defendant receives the NOI is irrelevant”; timeliness i s
based on when the plaintiff mailed the NOI. DeCosta v Gossage,
486 Mich 116, 126 (2010) (emphasis added) (plurality opinion).
In DeCosta, the plaintiff mailed the NOI to the defendants’
prior business address two days before the statute o f
limitations was set to expire. Id. at 121. An unknown
individual at the prior address accepted the NOI and
forwarded it to the defendants’ current business address. Id.
Based on the specific facts of the case, the Court could no t
“infer that the [current] office address was defendants’ sol e
business address for purposes of receiving professional
business correspondence,” thus, the NOI was not defective. Id.
at 124-125. The Court went on to conclude that assuming a
defect had actually occurred, “it was a minor technical defec t
in the proceedings because defendants actually received th e
NOI. Such minor technical defects can be cured under MCL
34
600.2301.” DeCosta, 486 Mich at 125.
“[T]he NOI requirement of MCL 600.2912b does not apply t o
an already-existing defendant after a medical malpractic e
action has commenced.” Kostadinovski v Harrington, 511 Mic h
141, 154 (2023). Put differently, “MCL 600.2912b does not appl y
33 See Section 9.11(C) for more information on commencing a medical malpractice action.

Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
where a plaintiff seeks to amend their complaint against a n
already-named defendant after suit has already bee n
commenced.”Kostadinovski, 511 Mich at 146. “The plai n
language of the statute clearly states that the NOI requiremen t
only applies before the action is commenced.” Id. at 15 1
(quotation marks and citation omitted). In Kostadinovski, the
“action had already commenced when plaintiffs sought t o
amend their complaint; accordingly, MCL 600.2912b did no t
require plaintiffs to also seek to amend their NOI. ”
Kostadinovski, 511 Mich at 151 (vacating footnote 6 i n
Kostadinovski v Harrington, 321 Mich App 736 (2017)).
35
2. Required Contents of NOI
The NOI must state, at least, all of the following:
(a) the factual basis for the claim;
(b) the alleged standard of practice or care;
(c) how the health facility or health professional
breached the standard of practice or care;
(d) what should have been done to comply wit h
the standard of practice or care;
(e) how the breach of the standard of practice or
care was the proximate cause of the claimant’ s
injuries;
(f) the names of all the health facilities and healt h
professionals the claimant is notifying pursuant t o
MCL 600.2912b. MCL 600.2912b(4).
An NOI is not required to be in any particular format. Roberts v
Mecosta Co Hosp, 470 Mich 679, 696 (2004). However, an NOI i s
insufficient unless it provides notice and a statemen t
containing all of the information required in MCL
600.2912b(4). Esselman v Garden City Hosp, 284 Mich App 209,
220 (2009). A statement is satisfactory if it “reasonabl y
communicate[s] to a medical professional or medica l
facility . . . the nature of the claim the plaintiff intends t o
pursue[.]” Id.
Additionally, MCL 600.2912b(4) does not require that “the
claimant specifically set forth the legal theory of vicariou s
liability within the NOI, when vicarious liability is the onl y
35See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Required Contents of Notice of Intent and Response Table.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
claim asserted” against the defendant named in the NOI. Potter
v McLeary, 484 Mich 397, 422-423 (2009).
Factual basis for claim. An NOI generally describing th e
events that led to the plaintiff’s injury properly sets out th e
factual basis for the plaintiff’s claim pursuant to MCL
600.2912b(4)(a). Roberts, 470 Mich at 690.
What should have been done to comply with standard of
practice or care. A recitation of facts contained in the NOI i s
insufficient to satisfy the requirement of MCL 600.2912b(4)(d)
that the claimant indicate what should have been done t o
comply with the standard of practice or care. Roberts, 470 Mic h
at 698.
Proximate cause. To satisfy MCL 600.2912b(4)(e), the claiman t
must include specific allegations regarding the conduct of an y
named defendants. Roberts, 470 Mich at 699-700. “[I]t is no t
sufficient under [MCL 600.2912b(4)(e)] to merely state tha t
defendants’ alleged negligence caused an injury. Rather, [MCL
600.2912b(4)(e)] requires that a notice of intent more precisely
contain a statement as to the manner in which it is alleged tha t
the breach was a proximate cause of the injury.” Roberts, 47 0
Mich at 699 n 16.
Names of health professionals/facilities receiving notice.
Nothing in MCL 600.2912b(4) requires a plaintiff’s NOI t o
identify the relationship between the parties being sued. Potter,
484 Mich at 421. MCL 600.2912b(4)(f) “clearly states that al l
that need be done in this regard is to identify the names of th e
health professional and facility being notified.” Potter, 48 4
Mich at 421.
3. Challenging an NOI
“In a medical malpractice action, unless the court allows a later
challenge for good cause, . . . all challenges to a notice of inten t
to sue must be made by motion, filed pursuant to MCR 2.119,
at the time the defendant files its first response to th e
complaint, whether by answer or motion[.]” MCR
2.112(L)(2)(a).
Grounds. MCR 2.112(L)(2)(a) applies to challenges “based o n
the timeliness of the NOI, the plaintiff’s compliance with th e
notice waiting period, a claim that no NOI was received, or th e
contents of the NOI[.]” Sanders v McLaren-Macomb, 323 Mic h
App 254, 268-269 (2018) (holding that nothing in the court rul e
indicates its application is limited to content challenges).
“[E]ach of these different types of challenges is just one of th e
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-77
=== Page 530 ===
Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
possible grounds on which to challenge the sufficiency of th e
NOI and is essentially a challenge to the NOI. Id. at 269.
Timing. A motion challenging the NOI must be “filed at the
time of [the defendant’s] first response to the complaint. ”
Sanders, 323 Mich App at 270-271. Accordingly, defendants
failed to comply with MCR 2.112(L)(2)(a) by raising their
challenge to the NOI in a motion filed after their answers, an d
there was no good cause to allow a later challenge to the NO I
where “the record show[ed] that defendants had the necessar y
information to comply with the requirements of MCR
2.112(L)(2)(a) before defendants filed their answers.” Sanders,
323 Mich App at 271-272 (further holding that the court record
included a proof of mailing indicating that the NOIs wer e
addressed to the defendants providing prima facie evidenc e
that the plaintiff complied with MCL 600.2912b; accordingly ,
any challenge to the sufficiency of the notice, including that th e
NOIs were never received, was required to be made accordin g
to the court rule).
36
4. Defective NOI Established: Dismiss or Allow Cure?
Where a trial court is presented with a defective NOI, it mus t
apply a two-pronged test to decide whether the defects requir e
dismissal without prejudice or whether to allow the plaintiff t o
37
cure the defect under MCL 600.2301. Bush v Shabahang, 48 4
Mich 156, 177 (2009). The two-pronged test is: “first, whether a
substantial right of a party is implicated and, second, whethe r
a cure is in the furtherance of justice.” Id.
Substantial right of a party. “[N]o substantial right of a health
care provider is implicated” because defective NOIs should b e
expected at such an early stage in the proceedings whe n
medical records may not have been tendered, defendants are
“sophisticated health professionals with extensive medical
background and training,” and defendants who are able to ac t
as their own reviewing experts should have “the ability t o
understand the nature of the claims being asserted against hi m
36See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Amendment of Defective Notice of Intent Flowchart.
37 MCL 600.2301 provides a mechanism for curing certain defects within any “‘process, pleading o r
proceeding.’” Bush v Shabahang, 484 Mich 156, 176 (2009), quoting MCL 600.2301. In Bush, the Court
concluded that the NOI is part of a medical malpractice proceeding; thus, MCL 600.2301 applies to the
NOI. Bush, 484 Mich at 176-177. The Court clarified its Bush holding in Driver v Naini, 490 Mich 239, 25 4
(2011), where it found that MCL 600.2301, by its plain language, requires the action or proceeding subject
to cure to be “pending.” An NOI served outside the applicable limitations period “cannot be pending if it
was time-barred at the outset.” Driver, 490 Mich at 254. Thus, MCL 600.2301 is inapplicable in such cases.
Driver, 490 Mich at 254.
Page 9-78 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 531 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
or her even in the presence of defects in the NOI.” Bush, 48 4
Mich at 178.
But see Griesbach v Ross (On Remand), 291 Mich App 295, 30 0
(2011), where the Court of Appeals found that an NOI that fail s
to name a party is fatally defective because the unnamed part y
is not given the opportunity to evaluate the claim against hi m
or her, implicating the unnamed party’s substantial rights.
“Thus, the complete failure to serve [a defendant] with an NO I
cannot be considered a mere defect, subject to cure.” Id. at 300.
Cure is in the furtherance of justice. A cure is in the
furtherance of justice “when a party makes a good-fait h
attempt to comply with the content requirements of [MCL
600.2912b].” Bush, 484 Mich at 178. Therefore, “[a] dismissal
would only be warranted if the party fails to make a good-fait h
attempt to comply with the content requirements.” Id. at 180.
Types of “cures” for NOI defects include disregarding the
defect(s) or allowing the plaintiff to amend the NOI unde r
MCL 600.2301 and MCR 2.118. See Bush, 484 Mich at 180-181,
181 n 44 (holding that although the plaintiff’s NOI did no t
adequately address the standard of care applicable to two
defendants, “[p]laintiff made a good-faith attempt to addres s
each of the subsections enumerated in [MCL 600.2912b(4)],”
and “the vast majority of plaintiff’s NOI was in complianc e
with” that statute; accordingly, because of the good-fait h
attempt to comply with the statute and the substantial rights o f
the parties were not affected by the defects, “the alleged fact s
[could] be cured pursuant to [MCL 600.2301]”). See als o
Kostadinovski v Harrington, 321 Mich App 736, 750 (2017). I n
Kostadinovski, the plaintiffs timely served an NOI and timel y
filed their complaint and affidavit of merit, but determined
after discovery and expiration of the limitations period, tha t
the previously-identified negligence and breach-of-car e
allegations did not apply and that the standard of care ha d
instead been breached by the defendant-physician in a
different manner; accordingly, the trial court “was required t o
assess whether the NOI defect could be disregarded or cured
by an amendment of the NOI under MCL 600.2301[.] ”
Kostadinovski, 321 Mich App at 740 (holding that the trial cour t
erred in “automatically disallowing plaintiffs to amend thei r
complaint,” and noting that, unlike the circumstances in Driver
v Naini, 490 Mich 239 (2011), the plaintiffs’ “amended NOI
38
would not entail adding a new party,” and directing the trial
38 A plaintiff cannot amend an original NOI to add a nonparty defendant under MCL 600.2957 in a n
attempt to avoid compliance with the notice waiting period. Driver, 490 Mich at 258.

Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
court on remand “to engage in an analysis under MCL
600.2301 to determine whether amendment of the NOI or
disregard of the prospective NOI defect would b e
appropriate”).
“[W]hen an NOI fails to meet all of the content requirement s
under MCL 600.2912b(4), MCL 600.2301 allows a plaintiff t o
amend the NOI and preserve tolling unless the plaintiff failed
to make a good-faith effort to comply with MCL 600.2912b(4). ”
Driver, 490 Mich at 252-253.
5. Tolling of the Statute of Limitations During Notice
39
Waiting Period
The statute of limitations is tolled at the time an NOI is timel y
filed, “if during that period a claim would be barred by th e
statute of limitations[.]” MCL 600.5856(c). However, “th e
statute is tolled not longer than the number of days equal t o
the number of days remaining in the applicable notice period
after the date notice is given.” Id.
An NOI is timely filed, and the medical malpractice limitation s
period “is tolled when the NOI is filed on the last day of th e
limitations period, leaving no whole days of the limitation s
period to toll.” Haksluoto v Mt Clemens Regional Med Ctr, 500
Mich 304, 307 (2017). Accordingly, “when an NOI is filed o n
the final day of the limitations period, the next business da y
after the [182-day] notice period expires is an eligible day t o
file suit.” Id. at 323. “[T]he law of counting time indicates tha t
the first fractional day–i.e., the day that triggers the running o f
the time period–is excluded, while the last day is included,
based on common-law notions of fairness.” Id. at 318. The rule
of fractional days provides “that once the notice period end s
and the time for the plaintiff to bring a claim once again begin s
to run, it will run for the number of whole days remaining in the
limitations period when the NOI was filed, plus one day t o
reflect the fractional day remaining when the NOI itself wa s
filed.” Id. at 322-323.
The tacking on of additional 182-day periods is not allowed, n o
matter how many notices are subsequently filed or how man y
health professionals or health facilities are notified. MCL
600.2912b(6). “[T]he prohibition . . . against tacking only
precludes a plaintiff from enjoying the benefit of multipl e
tolling periods. It does not . . . restrict the application of the
40
tolling provision in [MCL 600.5856(c) ] to the initial notice of
39 For more information on the statute of limitations in a medical malpractice case, see Section 9.11(A)

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
intent to sue if the tolling provision in [MCL 600.5856(c)] did
not even apply to the initial notice of intent to sue. State d
otherwise, if the initial notice did not toll the statute o f
limitations period, there would be no problem of ‘successiv e
182-day periods’ that [MCL 600.2912b(6)] prohibits.” Mayberr y
v Gen Orthopedics, PC, 474 Mich 1, 7-8 (2005). See also Hoffman v
Boonsiri, 290 Mich App 34, 43 (2010), where it was undisputed
that the filing of the original NOI did not trigger the tollin g
provision under MCL 600.5856(c). Therefore, the filing of a n
amended NOI did not constitute tacking, and thus, initiate d
tolling. Hoffman, 290 Mich App at 43. In Hoffman, the plaintiff
filed her complaint 319 days after filing the original NOI and
123 days after filing the amended NOI. Id. at 37-38. The
defendants argued that the plaintiff could not rely on th e
amended NOI to toll the statute of limitations, and at the sam e
time rely on the original NOI to render her complaint timel y
under MCL 600.2912b (the 182-day rule). Hoffman, 290 Mic h
App at 37. The Court of Appeals disagreed and “reject[ed ]
the . . . defendants’ contention that the availability of tolling i s
linked to the ‘waiting’ or ‘no-suit’ period.” Id. at 49.
Whether defects are present in a party’s NOI is irrelevant t o
determining whether the statute of limitations is tolled. Bush v
Shabahang, 484 Mich 156, 170 (2009). Rather, MCL 600.5856(c)
only requires that the NOI comply with the “applicable notic e
period under [MCL 600.2912b]” in order to invoke the tollin g
provision. Bush, 484 Mich at 170.
Where a medical malpractice claim was properly commenced
and the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that did not nam e
new defendants or set forth any new potential causes of injur y
but “merely set[] forth more specific details” about the claim, a
supplemental NOI satisfied the notice requirements of MCL
600.2912b. Decker v Rochowiak, 287 Mich App 666, 679, 68 1
(2010) (the plaintiff was not required to file a new NOI, thus,
the plaintiff did not have to comply with a new 182-da y
waiting period under MCL 600.2912b).
6. Required Access to Records
Both the claimant and the health professional or health facilit y
receiving the notice must allow each other “access to all of th e
[41]
medical records related to the claim” in their control. MCL
40 Formerly MCL 600.5856(d).
41The term medical record, as used in the Revised Judicature Act, cannot be interpreted by reference to th e
definition of medical record in the Medical Records Access Act, MCL 333.26263, because that definition i s
limited to its use in the Medical Records Access Act. Wade v McCadie, 499 Mich 895 (2016).
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-81
=== Page 534 ===
Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
600.2912b(5). The claimant must provide access within 56 day s
of giving notice, and the health professional or health facilit y
must provide access within 56 days of receiving the notice. I n
addition, the claimant must also “furnish releases for an y
medical records related to the claim that are not in th e
claimant’s control, but of which the claimant has knowledge. ”
Id.
A defendant is not obligated under MCL 600.2912b(5) “to offe r
a timely explanation for why documents not within th e
defendant’s control are no longer available.” Wade v McCadie,
499 Mich 895 (2016) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).
7. Required Response by Health Professional or Health
42
Facility
“Within 154 days after receipt of [an NOI], the healt h
professional or health facility against whom the claim is mad e
shall furnish to the claimant or his or her authorize d
representative a written response that contains a statement o f
each of the following:
(a) The factual basis for the defense to the claim.
(b) The standard of practice or care that the healt h
professional or health facility claims to be
applicable to the action and that the healt h
professional or health facility complied with tha t
standard.
(c) The manner in which it is claimed by the healt h
professional or health facility that there wa s
compliance with the applicable standard of
practice or care.
(d) The manner in which the health professional or
health facility contends that the alleged negligence
of the health professional or health facility was no t
the proximate cause of the claimant’s alleged injury
or alleged damage.” MCL 600.2912b(7)(a)-(d).
In lieu of furnishing a written response, a health professional
or health facility may submit an affidavit to the court certifyin g
that he or she was not involved in the occurrence alleged in th e
action. MCL 600.2912c(1). “Unless the affidavit is opposed
pursuant to [MCL 600.2912c(2)], the court shall order the
dismissal of the claim, without prejudice, against the affiant. ”
42See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Required Contents of Notice of Intent and Response Table.
Page 9-82 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 535 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
MCL 600.2912c(1). “Any party to the action may oppose the
dismissal or move to vacate an order of dismissal and reinstat e
the party who filed the affidavit if it can be shown that th e
party filing the affidavit was involved in the occurrenc e
alleged in the action.” MCL 600.2912c(2). “Reinstatement of a
party to the action under this subdivision shall not be barre d
by any statute of limitations defense that was not valid at th e
time the action was originally commenced against the affiant. ”
Id.
If the claimant does not receive a written response by day 154,
he or she may start a medical malpractice action on th e
expiration of the 154-day period. MCL 600.2912b(8).
“If at any time during the applicable notice period under [MCL
600.2912b] a health professional or health facility receivin g
notice under this section informs the claimant in writing tha t
the health professional or health facility does not intend t o
settle the claim within the applicable notice period, th e
claimant may commence an action alleging medica l
malpractice against the health professional or health facility, s o
long as the claim is not barred by the statute of limitations. ”
MCL 600.2912b(9).
C. Filing the Complaint and Affidavit of Merit
“[A] medical malpractice action can only be commenced by filing a
timely NOI [under MCL 600.2912b] and then filing a complaint an d
an affidavit of merit after the applicable notice period has expired,
but before the period of limitations has expired.” Tyra v Orga n
43
Procurement Agency of Mich, 498 Mich 68, 94 (2015). Therefore,
where a plaintiff prematurely files a complaint and affidavit of
merit, he or she does not commence an action against the defendant,
and the statute of limitations is not tolled. Id. See also MCL
600.2912d. A medical malpractice action begins when “a timely
served complaint is filed.” Ottgen v Katranji, 511 Mich 223, 245
(2023). “Filing an [affidavit of merit] under MCL 600.2912d(1) is no t
required to commence a medical malpractice action and toll th e
statutory limitations period.” Ottgen, 511 Mich at 228 (“failure t o
comply with MCL 600.2912d(1) can still be a basis for dismissal of a
case—just not on statute-of-limitations grounds”).
43See Section 9.11(B) for information on notice of intent and Section 9.11(C)(3) for information on
affidavits of merit.

Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
1. Consequences of Premature Filing of Complaint
MCL 600.2912b “unequivocally provides that a person ’shal l
not’ commence an action alleging medical malpractice agains t
a health professional or health facility until the expiration o f
the statutory notice period.” Driver v Naini, 490 Mich 239, 256-
257 (2011), quoting Burton v Reed City Hosp Corp, 471 Mich 745,
752 (2005). Typically, the proper remedy for failing to compl y
with the no-suit period set out in MCL 600.2912b b y
prematurely filing suit is dismissal without prejudice. Ellout v
Detroit Med Ctr, 285 Mich App 695, 698-699 (2009). However, if
a plaintiff fails to comply with the no-suit period and th e
statute of limitations has expired, the defendant is entitled t o
summary disposition and the plaintiff’s “complaint[] must b e
dismissed with prejudice.” See Tyra v Organ Procurement
Agency of Mich, 498 Mich 68, 94 (2015).
44
2. Issues Involving Amended Complaints
A plaintiff does not need to file an amended or additiona l
affidavit when filing an amended complaint if the firs t
affidavit met the requirements in MCL 600.2912d. King v Reed,
278 Mich App 504, 520 (2008). In King, the plaintiff learned
additional facts during the course of discovery that prompte d
him to amend his complaint to include theories of negligenc e
not included in the plaintiff’s original affidavit of merit. Id. at
512. The defendant argued that the plaintiff’s failure to file a n
amended or additional affidavit of merit in support of the ne w
theories of negligence in his amended complaint precluded th e
plaintiff from litigating the allegations not referenced in th e
plaintiff’s original affidavit of merit. Id. The Michigan Court of
Appeals disagreed and stated, “[b]ecause discovery was no t
available until after plaintiff filed his complaint and affidavit o f
merit, plaintiff’s affidavit of merit was not required to contai n
information that could not have been known to plaintiff befor e
discovery had commenced.” Id. at 517.

3. Required Contents of the Affidavit of Merit
If the plaintiff is represented by an attorney, the affidavit o f
merit must be “signed by a health professional who th e
plaintiff’s attorney reasonably believes meets the requirement s
for an expert witness under [MCL 600.2169].” MCL
44 This discussion does not discuss the interplay between the filing of an amended complaint and the
notice of intent. See 9.11(B)(6) for information on that topic.

600.2912d(1). “[T]he ‘reasonably believes’ language [in MCL
600.2912d] demonstrates that there will be cases in whic h
counsel had such a reasonable belief even though the expert i s
ultimately shown not to meet the criteria of MCL 600.2169(1). ”
Jones v Botsford Continuing Care Corp, 310 Mich App 192, 200
(2015) (holding that the two affidavits of merit in this case wer e
based on a reasonable belief that the two experts, a registere d
nurse and a physician specializing in geriatric care, could offe r
testimony regarding the standard of care for an LPN and for a
physician who appeared to specialize in geriatrics,
respectively; declining to address whether either witness could
actually offer such testimony at trial). To determine whether a n
attorney’s belief was reasonable, the court should “examine th e
information available to the plaintiff’s counsel when he or sh e
was preparing the affidavit of merit. Bates v Gilbert, 479 Mich
451, 459, 461 (2007) (holding that “[i]n view of the clea r
language of relevant statutes, the caselaw existent at the tim e
plaintiff’s attorney filed the affidavit of merit, and the eviden t
distinction between ophthalmology and
optometry, . . . plaintiff’s counsel could not have reasonabl y
believed that an ophthalmologist was qualified under MCL
600.2169 to address the standard of practice or care applicable
to an optometrist”).
An affidavit of merit must “certify that the health professiona l
has reviewed the notice and all medical records supplied t o
him or her by the plaintiff’s attorney concerning the allegation s
contained in the notice and shall contain a statement of each o f
the following:
(a) The applicable standard of practice or care.
(b) The health professional’s opinion that the
applicable standard of care was breached by the
health professional or health facility receiving the
notice.
(c) The actions that should have been taken or
omitted by the health professional or health facility
in order to have complied with the applicable
standard of practice or care.
(d) The manner in which the breach of the
standard of practice or care was the proximate
cause of the injury alleged in the notice.” MCL
600.2912d(1)(a)-(d).

Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
Failure to include any of the required information set forth in
MCL 600.2912d(1) results in an insufficient affidavit of merit.
Ligons v Crittenton Hosp, 490 Mich 61, 77 (2011).
It is permissible for an affidavit of merit to set out the standard
of care as required by MCL 600.2912d(1)(a) and then use th e
exact same verbiage from the standard of care section of th e
affidavit to state how the defendant breached the standard o f
care and the actions that should have been taken or omitted i n
order to have complied with the applicable standard of care, i n
order to satisfy the requirements of MCL 600.2912d(1)(b) and
MCL 600.2912d(1)(c). Lucas v Awaad, 299 Mich App 345, 377-
380 (2013).
MCL 600.2912d(1)(d) requires the affidavit of merit to indicate
“the manner in which there was a breach [in the standard o f
care]: The answer to ‘How was the standard of care breached?’
is never ‘The standard of care was breached.’” Ligons, 490 Mic h
at 77-78 (2011) (simply stating the result of the breach is
insufficient) (emphasis added).
“There is no specific requirement concerning which hospital o r
medical provider’s records must have been reviewed in orde r
for the expert to ascertain a breach of the standard o f
care. . . . It is sufficient, under the plain language of the statute,
for the expert to indicate that he or she has reviewed th e
records provided by the plaintiff’s counsel and that in light o f
those records, the expert is willing and able to opine wit h
respect to the defendant’s negligence consistently with th e
elements set forth in the [MCL 600.2912(d)(1)].” Kalaj v Khan,
295 Mich App 420, 427 (2012). In Kalaj, the Court of Appeals
held that the plaintiff’s expert’s failure to review the same x-ra y
films on which the defendant doctor had based his diagnosis,
and which the plaintiff’s attorney had not provided to th e
expert, did not invalidate the affidavit of merit because ther e
were other records from which the expert could conclude tha t
the defendants were negligent. Id. at 429. The absence of th e
films “may affect the weight and credibility afforded to exper t
testimony,” but it “does not render that expert testimon y
inadmissible.” Id. at 429-430. See the Michigan Judicia l
Institute’s Evidence Benchbook, Chapter 4, for additional
information on expert witnesses (both in general and in th e
context of medical malpractice actions).
4. Nonconforming Affidavits of Merit
An affidavit that is timely filed is presumed valid, and “toll[s ]

successfully challenged in ‘subsequent judicial proceedings.’ ”
46
Kirkaldy v Rim, 478 Mich 581, 586 (2007). “If the defendan t
believes that an affidavit is deficient, the defendant mus t
challenge the affidavit. If that challenge is successful, th e
proper remedy is dismissal without prejudice.” Id.
The required procedure for challenging an affidavit of merit i s
set forth by MCR 2.112(L)(2). The court rule provides that “[i] n
a medical malpractice action, unless the court allows a late r
challenge for good cause . . . all challenges to an affidavit o f
merit . . ., including challenges to the qualifications of th e
signer, must be made by motion, filed pursuant to MCR 2.119,
within 63 days of service of the affidavit on the opposing party.
An affidavit of merit . . . may be amended in accordance wit h
the terms and conditions set forth in MCR 2.118 and MCL
600.2301.” MCR 2.112(L)(2)(b).
“MCR 2.112(L)(2)(b) does not limit itself to errors in the body
of the AOM, but applies also to the ‘qualifications of th e
signer.’ Because such a correction will, for all intents and
purposes, require that a different health professional sign th e
affidavit, the text of the rule allows a plaintiff to amend her
AOM by submitting one signed by a properly qualified
physician.” Legion-London v Surgical Institute of Mic h
Ambulatory Surgery Ctr, LLC, 331 Mich App 364, 370, 376 (2020)
(the “amendment relates back to the original filing” pursuan t
to MCR 2.118(D); see Section 3.7(F) for more information o n
the “relation-back” rule). In Legion-London, plaintiff’s proposed
amendment to substitute a different affiant was within th e
purview of MCR 2.118(D) where it was “undisputed that [the]
proposed amendment arose out of the same conduct as th e
conduct described in the original AOM.” Legion-London, 331
Mich App at 369 (noting “[t]here may be instances wher e
seeking to substitute a different affiant implicates one of [the ]
reasons for denial” but that none of those reasons were presen t
in this case).
An affidavit that fails to name the health professional whos e
conduct allegedly caused the injury at issue fails to conform t o
the requirements of MCL 600.2912d. Glisson v Gerrity, 274 Mic h

“[Q]uestions of law relating to the sufficiency of an affidavit o f
merit” are reviewed de novo. Vanslembrouck v Halperin, 27 7
Mich App 558, 560-561 (2008). A court’s decision to strike a n
affidavit is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Kalaj v Khan,
295 Mich App 420, 425 (2012).
5. Timing and Statutory Tolling Period for Filing
Affidavit of Merit
Within 56 days after giving notice of intent under MCL
600.2912b, “the claimant shall allow the health professional o r
health facility receiving the notice access to all of the medica l
records related to the claim that are in the claimant's control,
and shall furnish releases for any medical records related to th e
claim that are not in the claimant's control, but of which th e
claimant has knowledge,” and “[s]ubject to [MCL 600.6013(9)],
within 56 days after receipt of [the] notice [of intent], the healt h
professional or health facility shall allow the claimant access t o
all medical records related to the claim that are in the control o f
the health professional or health facility.” MCL 600.2912b(5).
“If the defendant in an action alleging medical malpractic e
fails to allow access to medical records within the time perio d
set forth in [MCL 600.2912b(5)], the affidavit required under
[MCL 600.2912d(1)] may be filed within 91 days after the filin g
of the complaint.” MCL 600.2912d(3). “Upon motion of a party
for good cause shown, the court in which the complaint is filed
may grant the plaintiff or, if the plaintiff is represented by a n
attorney, the plaintiff's attorney an additional 28 days in whic h
to file the affidavit required under [MCL 600.2912d(1)].” MCL
600.2912d(2).
“Filing an [affidavit of merit] under MCL 600.2912d(1) is no t
required to commence a medical malpractice action and tol l
the statutory limitations period.” Ottgen v Katranji, 511 Mic h
223, 228 (2023). “Instead, the normal tolling rules apply t o
medical malpractice actions, and tolling occurs upon the filin g
of a timely served complaint. Nevertheless, failure to compl y
with MCL 600.2912d(1) can still be a basis for dismissal of a
case—just not on statute-of-limitations grounds.” Ottgen, 511
Mich at 228-229.
“[B]ecause plaintiff did not file an AOM within 91 days o f
filing her complaint, summary dismissal [was] the prope r
result regardless of whether defendants violated MCL
600.2912b(5).” Zarzyski v Nigrelli, 337 Mich App 735, 738 (2021)
(“summary disposition to defendants under MCR 2.116(C)(7)”
was proper “because the action was barred by the statute o f
limitations”). Although “the parties were litigating the issu e
Page 9-88 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 541 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
whether MCL 600.2912d(3) was implicated in [the] case, . . . the
clock began running on the 91-day period when the complain t
was filed[.]” Zarzyski, 337 Mich App at 742. “Assuming,
without deciding, that defendants failed to allow plaintif f
access to all medical records related to her claim that were i n
their control within 56 days after receiving the NOI unde r
MCL 600.2912b(5), plaintiff nevertheless failed to file an AO M
within 91 days of the complaint for purposes of MCL
600.2912d(3).” Zarzyski, 337 Mich App at 742. The language of
MCL 600.2912d(3) is “plain and unambiguous.” Zarzyski, 337
Mich App at 742. “MCL 600.2912d(3) simply does no t
accommodate for time spent litigating its application; there i s
no tolling language with respect to the 91-day period,” and “ a
medical malpractice plaintiff needs to file an AOM within 9 1
days—even if a defendant conclusively did not allow any
access to medical records, subject, perhaps, to MCL
600.2912d(2).” Zarzyski, 337 Mich App at 742-743, 742 n 1
(plaintiff did not invoke MCL 600.2912d(2) and the court took
“no position regarding whether the 28-day, good-caus e
provision in MCL 600.2912d(2) is available to extend the 91-
day period in MCL 600.2912d(3)”).
The tolling period under MCL 600.2912d(2) is “an extension ”
that runs “from the date the complaint is filed, irrespective o f
when the motion is granted.” Castro v Goulet, 312 Mich App 1, 6
(2015). “The obvious significance of the timing requirements i n
MCL 600.2912d(2) is that a plaintiff who makes a motion t o
extend time must proceed on the assumption that the motio n
will be granted.” Castro, 312 Mich App at 7 (holding that the
case was timely filed where the statute of limitations expired
on February 9, 2013, and the plaintiffs filed their complaint and
their motion to extend the time for filing an affidavit of meri t
on February 4, 2013, filed the affidavit of merit on February 26,
2013, and the trial court granted their motion for an extensio n
48
on March 8, 2013).
Motions under MCL 600.2912d(2) may be granted “for good
cause shown[.]” MCL 600.2912d(2). The term good cause is “s o
general and elastic in its import that [the Court] canno t
presume any legislative intent beyond opening the door for th e
court to exercise its best judgment and discretion i n
determining if conditions exist which excuse the delay whe n
special circumstances are proven to that end.” Castro, 312 Mic h
App at 7 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The tria l
court’s determination of whether good cause to grant a n

untimely.” Castro, 312 Mich App at 5.

Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
extension exists is discretionary and will not be disturbed o n
appeal unless the decision falls outside the range of principled
outcomes. Id. at 8-9 (affirming the trial court’s finding of good
cause to grant an extension where the plaintiffs delayed filing a
lawsuit because they were informed by the defendants that th e
patient’s negative side effects from the surgery would heal o n
their own over time).
6. Authentication of Out-of-State Affidavits of Merit
“If by law the affidavit of a person residing in another state o f
the United States or in a foreign country is required or may b e
received in an action or judicial proceeding in this state, t o
entitle the affidavit to be read, it must be authenticated unde r
section 25a of the Michigan law on notarial acts, . . . MCL
55.285a, or be an unsworn declaration executed under [the
Uniform Unsworn Foreign Declarations Act, MCL 600.2181 et
seq.]” MCL 600.2102.
49
7. Affidavit of Meritorious Defense
A defendant must file an affidavit of meritorious defens e
within 91 days after the plaintiff serves the affidavit of meri t
under MCL 600.2912d. MCL 600.2912e(1). However, if th e
plaintiff “fails to allow access to medical records as required
under [MCL 600.2912b(5)], a defendant may file an affidavit of
meritorious defense “within 91 days after filing an answer t o
50
the complaint.” MCL 600.2912e(2).
“The affidavit of meritorious defense shall certify that th e
health professional has reviewed the complaint and all medical
records supplied to him or her by the defendant’s attorne y
concerning the allegations contained in the complaint and shall
contain a statement on each of the following:
(a) The factual basis for each defense to the claim s
[51]
made against the defendant in the complaint.
(b) The standard of practice or care that the healt h
professional or health facility named as a
defendant in the complaint claims to be applicable
49See the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Required Contents of Affidavit of Merit and Response Table.
50The defendant must file an answer to the complaint within 21 days after the plaintiff has filed an affidavit
of merit. MCL 600.2912e(1).
51“MCL 600.2912e(1)(a) only requires a ‘factual basis for each defense,’ not a factual basis for each claim
asserted by the plaintiff.” Lucas v Awaad, 299 Mich App 345, 373 (2013). “If no factual basis is applicabl e
for a particular defense, then no factual basis needs to be, or could be, provided.” Id.
Page 9-90 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 543 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
to the action and that the health professional or
health facility complied with that standard.
(c) The manner in which it is claimed by the healt h
professional or health facility named as a
defendant in the complaint that there wa s
compliance with the applicable standard of
practice or care.
(d) The manner in which the health professional or
health facility named as a defendant in the
complaint contends that the alleged injury or
alleged damage to the plaintiff is not related to the
care and treatment rendered.” MCL 600.2912e(1).
“Typically, defenses are based on an assertion that th e
defendant did not breach the applicable standard of care,
52
which is but one element in a malpractice case.” Lucas v
Awaad, 299 Mich App 345, 373 (2013). “However, defenses ar e
not limited to this element. If any element in a malpractic e
claim is not met, then a plaintiff cannot prevail.” Id.
The required procedure for challenging an affidavit o f
meritorious defense is set forth by MCR 2.112(L)(2). The cour t
rule provides that “[i]n a medical malpractice action, unless th e
court allows a later challenge for good cause . . . all challenge s
to an . . . affidavit of meritorious defense, including challenge s
to the qualifications of the signer, must be made by motion,
filed pursuant to MCR 2.119, within 63 days of service of th e
affidavit on the opposing party. An affidavit of . . . meritoriou s
defense may be amended in accordance with the terms an d
conditions set forth in MCR 2.118 and MCL 600.2301.” MCR
2.112(L)(2)(b).
D. Actions on Behalf of a Minor
“[A] minor is the real party in interest in a claim for damages arising
from alleged medical malpractice[.] Olin v Mercy Health Hackley
Campus, 328 Mich App 337, 352 (2019). Nothing in the governin g
court rules or caselaw require the “appointment of a next friend
prior to or simultaneous with the filing of the complaint on behalf of
the minor[.]” Id. at 352 (“the formal appointment of a next friend i s
[not] a meaningful date for statute of limitation purposes,” and the
trial court erred in dismissing plaintiff’s medical malpractice actio n
52To establish a claim of medical malpractice, the plaintiff must show (1) the appropriate standard of care
governing the defendant’s conduct; (2) that the defendant breached the standard of care; (3) that th e
plaintiff was injured; and (4) that the defendant’s breach of the standard of care was the proximate caus e
of the plaintiff’s injuries. Lucas, 299 Mich App at 373 n 4.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-91
=== Page 544 ===
Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
where the next friend was not appointed until after the expiration of
53
the statute of limitations period).
E. Statute of Repose
1. Generally
“Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an actio n
involving a claim based on medical malpractice may b e
commenced at any time within the applicable period
prescribed in [MCL 600.5805] or [MCL 600.5851 to MCL
600.5856], or within 6 months after the plaintiff discovers or
should have discovered the existence of the claim, whichever i s
later. However, except as otherwise provided in section [MCL
600.5851(7) or MCL 600.5851(8)], the claim shall not b e
commenced later than 6 years after the date of the act o r
omission that is the basis for the claim. The burden of provin g
that the plaintiff, as a result of physical discomfort,
appearance, condition, or otherwise, neither discovered no r
should have discovered the existence of the claim at least 6
months before the expiration of the period otherwis e
applicable to the claim is on the plaintiff. A medical
malpractice action that is not commenced within the tim e
prescribed by this subsection is barred. This subsection doe s
not apply, and the plaintiff is subject to the period o f
limitations set forth in [MCL 600.5838a(3)], under 1 of the
following circumstances:
(a) If discovery of the existence of the claim wa s
prevented by the fraudulent conduct of the healt h
care professional against whom the claim is made
or a named employee or agent of the healt h
professional against whom the claim is made, or of
the health facility against whom the claim is made
or a named employee or agent of a health facility
against whom the claim is made.
(b) There has been permanent loss of or damage t o
a reproductive organ resulting in the inability t o
procreate.” MCL 600.5838a(2).
“The only exceptions to the running of [the] six-year statute o f
repose are those created by the minority saving provisions o f
MCL 600.5851(7) and [MCL 600.5851(8)]–the only tw o
exceptions specifically mentioned in the statute.” Burton v
Macha, 303 Mich App 750, 756 (2014) (holding that “the deat h
53 See Section 2.15 for more information on standing and real party in interest requirements.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
saving provision of MCL 600.5852 does not toll or otherwis e
create an exception to the running of the six-year statute o f
repose”).
2. No Period of Repose in Certain Circumstances
“An action involving a claim based on medical malpractic e
under circumstances described in [MCL 600.5838a(2)(a)-(b)]
may be commenced at any time within the applicable period
prescribed in [MCL 600.5805 or MCL 600.5851 to MCL
600.5856], or within 6 months after the plaintiff discovers or
should have discovered the existence of the claim, whichever i s
later. The burden of proving that the plaintiff, as a result o f
physical discomfort, appearance, condition or otherwise,
neither discovered nor should have discovered the existence o f
the claim at least 6 months before the expiration of the period
otherwise applicable to the claim is on the plaintiff. A medical
malpractice action that is not commenced within the tim e
prescribed by this subsection is barred.” MCL 600.5838a(3).
3. Six-Month Discovery Rule
“‘[T]he discovery rule period begins to run when, on the basis of
objective facts, the plaintiff should have known of a possibl e
cause of action.” Hutchinson v Ingham Co Health Dep’t, 328 Mic h
App 108, 137 (2019), quoting Solowy v Oakwood Hosp Corp, 45 4
Mich 214, 222 (1997). The proper inquiry for determining
whether a plaintiff “should have discovered the existence of th e
claim” under MCL 600.5838a is “whether it was probable that a
reasonable lay person would have discovered the existence o f
the claim.” Jendrusina v Mishra, 316 Mich App 621, 624, 62 6
(2016) (noting that “the inquiry is not whether it was possible
for a reasonable lay person to have discovered the existence o f
the claim”).
“When . . . the facts compel an inference of an injury’s possible
cause, diligence has little role to play in evaluating whether a
plaintiff should have discovered a possible cause of action.
When the facts don’t compel an inference of a possible caus e
but do arouse suspicion,” diligence is required. Bowman v St .
John Hosp & Med Ctr, 508 Mich 320, 341 (2021). “[F]acts arouse
suspicion when they make a plaintiff wonder whether th e
defendant is responsible,” “[b]ut the facts that arouse a
plaintiff’s suspicions will vary from case to case,” underscorin g
“the importance of the record and its development.” Id. at 34 2
(quotation marks and citation omitted). The Michiga n
Supreme Court “will not impute to a plaintiff knowledge o f
cancer’s progression without a record basis to do so.” Id. at 345.
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-93
=== Page 546 ===
Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
In Bowman, plaintiff “was advised in 2013, based on an
interpretation of a mammogram, that a growth in her breas t
was benign. For the next two years, she felt the lump grow and
sought follow-up care. In 2015, she was diagnosed wit h
metastatic breast cancer. In August 2016, . . . she sought a
second opinion from a specialist and learned that the 201 3
mammogram might have been misread.” Id. at 327. Plaintif f
initiated proceedings in December 2016, and defendant s
moved for summary disposition arguing plaintiff should hav e
discovered the existence of her claim in 2015 upon bein g
diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. Id. at 327-329. Th e
Court affirmed the trial court’s denial of summary dispositio n
finding “the record [did] not reveal that [plaintiff] should hav e
known before June 2016 that her delayed diagnosis might hav e
been caused by a misreading of the 2013 mammogram.” Id. a t
327. “[T]he available facts didn’t allow her to infer that causa l
relationship, and the defendants have not shown tha t
[plaintiff] wasn’t diligent”; rather, the record allowed the Cour t
“to conclude, as a matter of law, that [plaintiff] sued over si x
months after she discovered or should have discovered th e
existence of her claim.” Id. at 327-328, 347 (noting “[i]t would
be procedurally inappropriate for us to conclude tha t
[plaintiff] was diligent, but [the] facts aren’t enough t o
conclude that she wasn’t”).
“[A] flexible approach must be employed in applying th e
‘possible cause of action’ standard, and . . . ‘courts should
consider the totality of information available to the plaintiff,
including [plaintiff’s] own observations of physical discomfor t
and appearance, [plaintiff’s] familiarity with the conditio n
through past experience or otherwise, and [plaintiff’s ]
physician’s explanations of possible causes or diagnoses o f
[their] condition.’” Hutchinson, 328 Mich App at 129, quotin g
Solowy, 454 Mich at 227. In Hutchinson, although the plaintiff
was “aware that she had a [growing] calcified lump in he r
breast,” her “subjective concerns as a layperson” that the lum p
“could have been something more serious, such as cancer, ”
was not an “objective fact[] that would have led [her] t o
conclude that the lump was in fact cancer,” when medical
providers “continued to tell plaintiff that the calcified lum p
was benign,” and plaintiff “did not have any familiarity wit h
breast cancer ‘through past experience or otherwise.’ ”
Hutchinson, 328 Mich App at 137-138. Thus, the trial cour t
erred in concluding plaintiff should have been “aware of a n
injury in the form of breast cancer, and any possible causatio n
relating to the alleged medical malpractice of defendants,
before her definitive diagnosis of breast cancer,” and i n
dismissing her claim as untimely. Id. at 140.

In Jendrusina, the trial court erred in determining that the
plaintiff’s medical malpractice claim against his primary car e
physician was not timely where the plaintiff knew he wa s
diagnosed with kidney failure but had never seen any of hi s
relevant lab reports or been informed about the abnormalitie s
the reports showed. Id. at 630-632. The Court explained that a
reasonable lay person does not have specialized medical
knowledge about “the anatomy, physiology, o r
pathophysiology of kidneys,” nor would a reasonable la y
person know “what creatinine is or what an abnormal
creatinine level means, in addition to knowing how kidney s
fail, why they fail, and how quickly they can fail.” Id. at 631-
632. Accordingly, it was not probable that a reasonable la y
person in the plaintiff’s position would have discovered th e
existence of the possible malpractice claim before being told b y
a medical specialist that earlier action could have prevente d
dialysis. Id. at 635.
F. Loss-of-Opportunity
The second sentence of MCL 600.2912a(2) provides that a plaintiff
in an action alleging medical malpractice “cannot recover for loss of
an opportunity to survive or an opportunity to achieve a better
result unless the opportunity was greater than 50%.” “[T]he spirit of
the lost-opportunity doctrine under MCL 600.2912a(2)” is “to allow
recovery for the loss of an opportunity to survive, not merely th e
initial opportunity to survive.” Benigni v Alsawah, 343 Mich Ap p
200, 208 (2022). The “loss-of-opportunity doctrine” applies “in case s
when the plaintiff suffers a loss of an opportunity to survive or
achieve a better result.” Id. at 210. However, “the second sentence of
[MCL 600.2912a(2)] applies only to medical malpractice cases tha t
plead loss of opportunity and not to those that plead traditional
medical malpractice[.]”O’Neal v St John Hosp & Med Ctr, 487 Mich
485, 506 (2010). Thus, “whether the second sentence of MCL
600.2912a(2) applies in a given case depends on the nature of th e
claims.” Benigni, 343 Mich App at 212.
In Benigni, the Estate of Patricia Benigni (“Estate”) alleged tha t
defendants “failed to timely diagnose Patricia’s recurrence of
colorectal cancer, causing [her] to suffer adverse sequela, including
death.” Benigni, 343 Mich App at 203. The Estate claimed tha t
“[c]atching the recurrence earlier would have given Patricia a better
prognosis, including survival and a cure.” Id. at 203. On appeal, th e
Benigni Court held that because “Patricia actually suffered an
adverse result (in this case death), this [was] a traditional medical
malpractice case, not a lost-opportunity case.” Id. at 203.

G. Death of a Plaintiff
MCL 600.5852, the wrongful-death saving provision, states:
“(1) If a person dies before the period of limitations ha s
run or within 30 days after the period of limitations ha s
run, an action that survives by law may be commence d
by the personal representative of the deceased person a t
any time within 2 years after letters of authority ar e
issued although the period of limitations has run.
(2) If the action that survives by law is an action allegin g
medical malpractice, the 2-year period under [MCL
600.5852(1)] runs from the date letters of authority are
issued to the first personal representative of an estate.
Except as provided in [MCL 600.5852(3)], the issuanc e
of subsequent letters of authority does not enlarge th e
time within which the action may be commenced.
(3) If a personal representative dies or is adjudged by a
court to be legally incapacitated within 2 years after hi s
or her letters are issued, the successor personal
representative may commence an action allegin g
medical malpractice that survives by law within 1 yea r
after the personal representative died or was adjudge d
by a court to be legally incapacitated.
(4) Notwithstanding [MCL 600.5852(1) to MCL
600.5852(3)], an action shall not be commenced under
[MCL 600.5852] later than 3 years after the period of
limitations has run.”
“MCL 600.5852 is not a statute of limitations; rather, it is a saving
provision designed to preserve actions that survive death in order
that the representative of the estate may have a reasonable time t o
pursue such actions.” Eversole v Nash, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2024)
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “[T]he death saving
provision of MCL 600.5852 [does] not toll or otherwise prevent the
[54]
running of the six-year statute of repose contained in MCL
600.5838a(2).” Burton v Macha, 303 Mich App 750, 757 (2014).
“[T]he 2-year period under [MCL 600.5852(1)] runs from the date
letters of authority are issued to the first personal representative of
an estate.” MCL 600.5852(2). “[L]etters of authority establishing a n
estate are ‘issued’ on the date they are signed by the register or the
probate judge.” Jesse Estate v Lakeland Specialty Hosp, 328 Mich App
142, 150 (2019). “Except as provided in [MCL 600.5852(3)], the
54 See Section 9.11(E) for more information on the statute of repose.

Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.11
issuance of subsequent letters of authority does not enlarge the time
within which the action may be commenced.” MCL 600.5852(2).
Notwithstanding MCL 600.5852(1) and MCL 600.5852(3), an action
may not be commenced under MCL 600.5852 “later than 3 year s
55
after the period of limitations has run.” MCL 600.5852(4).
MCL 600.5852 “clearly provides that it is an exception to th e
limitation period, allowing the commencement of a wrongful deat h
action as many as three years after the applicable statute of
limitations has expired.” Eversole, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “[U]nder MCL 600.5852, a persona l
representative may file a medical malpractice suit on behalf of a
deceased person for two years after letters of authority are issued, a s
long as that suit is commenced within three years after the two-year
malpractice limitations period expired.” Eversole, ___ Mich App at
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, MCL
600.5852 “provides a maximum of five years from the date th e
deceased’s medical-malpractice claim accrues in which a personal
representative may bring a wrongful-death action.” Eversole, __ _
Mich App at ___. “Thus, a wrongful-death action is properly
commenced pursuant to MCL 600.5852’s saving period if the
complaint was filed within two years of the issuance of the personal
representative’s letters of authority and within three years after the
period of limitations had expired.” Eversole, ___ Mich App at ___
(cleaned up).
In Eversole, the “plaintiff did not properly commence [the]
wrongful-death action as a personal representative acting under
letters of authority within the wrongful-death saving period a s
required by MCL 600.2922(2) and MCL 600.5852.” Eversole, ___ Mic h
App at ___. However, MCL 700.3701 provides that “a personal
representative’s authority to act on behalf of the estate arises fro m
her appointment, and relates back to previous acts taken by the
appointed person if those acts were beneficial to the estate.”
Eversole, ___ Mich App at ___. “[U]nder MCL 700.3701, the power s
granted by the letters of authority related back to the date plaintiff
filed the complaint on behalf of the estate” because “filing tha t
timely action was beneficial to the estate.” Eversole, ___ Mich App a t
___ (noting that “relation back of a personal representative’ s
appointment under MCL 700.3701 preserves an estate’s otherwise
valid wrongful-death claim by providing a means to cure the initial
lack of standing”). “It is true that under MCL 700.3701, it is th e
letters of authority that grant a person the power to act as a personal
representative, but it is equally true that if that power relates back t o
an earlier act, the law treats it as if the person was the personal

Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
representative when previously acting.” Eversole, ___ Mich App a t
___. “Thus, the requirement within MCL 600.5852, that the two-yea r
period commences once letters of authority are granted, will have
been complied with when acting under the legal fiction provided by
the relation-back provision of MCL 700.3701.” Eversole, ___ Mic h
App at ___ (“For the same reason, so too will have MCL
600.2922(2).”).
H. Medical Malpractice Trial
See Chapter 7 for general information on conducting civil jury and
bench trials.

regarding the admission of expert testimony at a medical
malpractice trial. See also the Michigan Judicial Institute’s Criteria for
Admission of Expert Testimony Flowchart.
I. Post-Verdict Phase and Judgment
56
Generally, MCR 2.601 et seq. governs any issues regarding a
judgment in a medical malpractice action. However, MCL
57
600.6306a specifically provides in part:
“After a verdict is rendered by a trier of fact in favor of a
plaintiff in a medical malpractice action, an order o f
judgment shall be entered by the court. Subject to [MCL
58
600.2959 ], the order of judgment shall be entered
against each defendant, including a third-part y
defendant, in the following order and in the followin g
amounts:
(a) All past economic damages, less collateral
source payments as provided in [MCL 600.6303].
(b) All past noneconomic damages, reduced
59
subject to the limitations in [MCL 600.1483 ] . . . .
(c) All future economic damages, less medical and
other health care costs, and less collateral source
56 See Section 8.1 for more information on judgments in civil cases.
57MCL 600.6306a is only applicable to actions in which the cause of action arose on or after March 28,
2013. 2012 PA 608.
58 MCL 600.2959 requires the court to reduce damages by the percentage of comparative fault of th e
person who died or was injured.
59MCL 600.1483 requires the court to reduce the total amount of damages for noneconomic loss to
$280,000.00 or $500,000.00 if one or more exceptions apply. See MCL 600.1483(1)(a)-(c).

payments determined to be collectible under [MCL
600.6303] . . . .
(d) All future medical and other health car e
costs . . . .
(e) All future noneconomic damages . . . reduced
subject to the limitations in [MCL 600.1483] . . .
(f) All taxable and allowable costs, includin g
interest as permitted by [MCL 600.6013 or MCL
600.6455 on the judgment amounts.” [MCL
600.6306a(1).]
See MCL 600.6306a(2)-(3), for information on reducing a judgmen t
when a plaintiff is assigned a percentage of fault or on judgment s
involving joint and several liability.
MCL 600.1483(1) provides in part:
“In a claim for damages alleging medical malpractice b y
or against a person or party, the total amount o f
damages for noneconomic loss recoverable by al l
plaintiffs, resulting from the medical malpractice of al l
defendants, shall not exceed $280,000.00 unless . . . 1 or
more . . . exceptions apply . . . in which case damage s
for noneconomic loss shall not exceed $500,000.00[.]”
“MCL 600.1483 does not affect the jury’s determination of th e
amount of damages; rather, the statute limits the legal consequence
of the jury’s finding.” Nelson v Beaumont Health, ___ Mich App ___,
___ (2025). “While the application of MCL 600.1483 is clear, the
statute lacks guidance on the manner and timing of administering
MCL 600.1482(1)(a).” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___. “MCL
600.1482(1)(a) governs the post-verdict phase of medical malpractice
cases, granting courts the authority to modify jury awards for
damages.” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___. MCL 600.1482(1)
specifically provides:
“Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, in a n
action that alleges a medical malpractice claim, both o f
the following apply:
(a) The damages recoverable for past medical
expenses or rehabilitation service expenses shall
not exceed the actual damages for medical care
that arise out of the alleged malpractice.
(b) Except for evidence of the actual damages fo r
medical care, the court shall not permit a plaintiff
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-99
=== Page 552 ===
Section 9.11 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
to introduce evidence of past medical expenses or
rehabilitation service expenses at trial.”
“Although MCL 600.6306a does not explicitly cite to MCL 600.1482, ”
“MCL 600.1482(1)(a) [is] applicable at the post-verdict stage. ”
Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___; see also id. at ___ (holding that “the
‘past economic damages’ specified in MCL 600.6306a(1)(a) should
be read to include the limitation of MCL 600.1482(1)(a) on ‘damage s
recoverable for past medical expenses or rehabilitation service’”).
“‘The statute limits recoverable past medical damages to ‘actual
damages for medical care,’ MCL 600.1482(1)(a), and defines th e
term as ‘[t]he dollar amount actually paid for past medical expense s
or rehabilitation service expenses by or on behalf of the individual
whose medical care is at issue,’ MCL 600.1482(2)(a)(i), and, ‘[a]ny
remaining dollar amount that the plaintiff is liable to pay for the
medical care,’ MCL 600.1482(2)(a)(ii).” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___.
In Nelson, “the jury awarded all potential economic damages as a
consolidated lump sum.” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___. “Defendant s
argue[d] that the trial court failed to properly apply MCL 600.1482
because the court entered a judgment corresponding to the full
amount that the jury awarded, which defendants claim[ed]
included ‘phantom damages.’” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___; see als o
id. at ___ n 2 (“‘Phantom damages’ are the difference betwee n
medical charges and the reduced amount actually paid for the
medical care through public or private insurance.”). “MCL
600.1482(1)(b) prohibits the admission of evidence of phanto m
damages, but MCL 600.1482(1)(a) clearly states that ‘damage s
recoverable for past medical expenses . . . shall not exceed the actua l
damages for medical care.’” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___. “Th e
presence of [the recovery] cap, however, indicates that it wa s
intended as a safeguard for situations in which evidence of
phantom damages is admitted.” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___.
Notably, “proof of damages need not be presented wit h
mathematical precision, and the amount of damages is an issue
determined by trier of fact.” Id. at ___ (citations omitted) .
“Accordingly, the application of MCL 600.1482(1)(a) at the post-
verdict phase should not require such precision or renewed fact-
finding.” Nelson, ___ Mich App at ___. “Consequently, the trial cour t
appropriately entered a judgment that aligned with the jury’ s
findings.” Id. at ___ (“The evidence substantiated the plaintiff’ s
entitlement to the full amount awarded.”).

9.12 Wrongful Death Act (WDA)
A. Commencing a Wrongful-Death Action
Under MCL 600.2922(2), “only a personal representative may
commence a wrongful-death action.” Eversole v Nash, ___ Mich App
___, ___ (2024). “Because an underlying claim survives by law and
must be prosecuted under the wrongful-death act, any statutory or
common-law limitations on the underlying claim apply to a
wrongful-death action.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Accordingly, a
wrongful-death medical-malpractice action is governed by the
statute of limitations and the accrual statute applicable to medical-
malpractice claims.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “However, the Legislature has afforded personal
representatives additional time in which to pursue legal action o n
behalf of a decedent’s estate.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted).
MCL 600.5852 “clearly provides that it is an exception to th e
limitation period, allowing the commencement of a wrongful deat h
action as many as three years after the applicable statute of
limitations has expired.” Eversole, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “[U]nder MCL 600.5852, a persona l
representative may file a medical malpractice suit on behalf of a
deceased person for two years after letters of authority are issued, a s
long as that suit is commenced within three years after the two-year
malpractice limitations period expired.” Eversole, ___ Mich App at
___ (quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, MCL
600.5852 “provides a maximum of five years from the date th e
deceased’s medical-malpractice claim accrues in which a personal
representative may bring a wrongful-death action.” Eversole, __ _
Mich App at ___. “Thus, a wrongful-death action is properly
commenced pursuant to MCL 600.5852’s saving period if the
complaint was filed within two years of the issuance of the personal
representative’s letters of authority and within three years after the
period of limitations had expired.” Eversole, ___ Mich App at ___
(cleaned up).
In Eversole, the “plaintiff did not properly commence [the]
wrongful-death action as a personal representative acting under
letters of authority within the wrongful-death saving period a s
required by MCL 600.2922(2) and MCL 600.5852.” Eversole, ___ Mic h
App at ___. However, MCL 700.3701 provides that “a personal
representative’s authority to act on behalf of the estate arises fro m
her appointment, and relates back to previous acts taken by the
appointed person if those acts were beneficial to the estate.”
Eversole, ___ Mich App at ___. “[U]nder MCL 700.3701, the power s
granted by the letters of authority related back to the date plaintiff

filed the complaint on behalf of the estate” because “filing tha t
timely action was beneficial to the estate.” Eversole, ___ Mich App a t
___ (noting that “relation back of a personal representative’ s
appointment under MCL 700.3701 preserves an estate’s otherwise
valid wrongful-death claim by providing a means to cure the initial
lack of standing”). “It is true that under MCL 700.3701, it is th e
letters of authority that grant a person the power to act as a personal
representative, but it is equally true that if that power relates back t o
an earlier act, the law treats it as if the person was the personal
representative when previously acting.” Eversole, ___ Mich App a t
___. “Thus, the requirement within MCL 600.5852, that the two-yea r
period commences once letters of authority are granted, will have
been complied with when acting under the legal fiction provided by
the relation-back provision of MCL 700.3701.” Eversole, ___ Mic h
App at ___ (“For the same reason, so too will have MCL
600.2922(2).”).
B. Damages under the WDA
The types of damages that are permitted by the WDA are specified
in MCL 600.2922(6), which states in part:
“In every action under this section, the court or jur y
may award damages as the court or jury shall conside r
fair and equitable, under all the circumstances includin g
reasonable medical, hospital, funeral, and buria l
expenses for which the estate is liable; reasonabl e
compensation for the pain and suffering, whil e
conscious, undergone by the deceased during th e
period intervening between the time of the injury an d
death; and damages for the loss of financial support an d
the loss of the society and companionship of th e
deceased.”
1. Reasonable Certainty Requirement
“A party asserting a claim has the burden of proving it s
damages with reasonable certainty.” Demott v VHS Harper-
Hutzel Hosp, Inc, ___ Mich App ___, ___ (2025) (quotatio n
marks and citation omitted). “Recovery is not permitted in a
tort action for remote, contingent, or speculative damages.” Id.
at ___ (quotation marks and citations omitted). “The general
rule, expressed in terms of damages, and long followed i n
[Michigan], is that in a tort action, the tort-feasor is liable for al l
injuries resulting directly from his wrongful act, whethe r
foreseeable or not, provided the damages are the legal and
natural consequences of the wrongful act, and are such as,
according to common experience and the usual course o f
Page 9-102 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 555 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.12
events, might reasonably have been anticipated.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “Remote, contingent,
or speculative damages are not considered in conformity to th e
general rule.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation s
omitted).
“Although damages based on speculation or conjecture are no t
recoverable, damages are not speculative merely because the y
cannot be ascertained with mathematical precision.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “It is sufficient if a
reasonable basis for computation exists, although the result b e
only approximate.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “Moreover, the certainty requirement is relaxe d
where the fact of damages has been established and the onl y
question to be decided is the amount of damages.” Id. at ___
(cleaned up) (emphasis omitted).
“The problem of speculative damages is particularly acute i n
the context wrongful-death actions due to the nature o f
damages in such cases . . . [.]” Id. at ___. “The pecuniary injury
contemplated by the wrongful death act requires consideratio n
of the probability of the happening of events which, as of th e
date of trial, have been permanently barred by the interventio n
of death.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Briefly put, there can be n o
such thing as direct evidence of future support when th e
supporter is dead.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “This fact alone guarantees that no testimony can b e
offered in proof of otherwise probable future support o r
contribution which completely avoids speculation.” Id. at ___
(cleaned up) (emphasis omitted). “Lack of proofs of an exac t
quality should not, however, be allowed to defeat th e
legislative purpose.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted) (“The Michigan wrongful death act is a remedial
measure designed to alleviate the harsh provisions of th e
common law which has generally been interpreted a s
forbidding compensation for wrongful death.”).
2. Loss-of-Services Damages
Generally, in order to “recover loss-of-services damages for a
deceased child through the child’s 21st birthday,” a plaintif f
must submit “evidence as to the respective ages and health o f
the parents of the child, and as to the child’s age, health an d
disposition.” Demott v VHS Harper-Hutzel Hosp, Inc, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ (2025) (cleaned up). Although “the WDA an d
caselaw ‘interpreting it allow consideration of loss of service s
of a minor in determining pecuniary injury of a
parent,’ . . . there [is] ‘a clear distinction between the services o f
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-103
=== Page 556 ===
Section 9.12 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
a minor and the contributions of an adult son or daughter to a
dependent parent.’” Id. at ___, quoting Thompson v Ogemaw C o
Bd of Rd Comm’rs, 357 Mich 482, 488 (1959) (holding that “the
test” for pecuniary-loss damages was “reasonable expectatio n
of support,” regardless of whether the child died before o r
after the age of majority).
However, “the rule announced in Thompson is not applicable in
the case of a very young child when it is impossible to sho w
such a reasonable expectation under the circumstances. ”
Demott, ___ Mich App at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted) (holding that “a plaintiff in a WDA action involvin g
an infant-decedent is not barred as a matter of law fro m
recovering loss-of-services damages for the time after th e
decedent would have reached the age of 18”). Indeed ,
“calculating damages in a wrongful-death action will alway s
require some speculation because of the very nature of th e
claims involved.” Id. at ___. “The degree of speculation will of
course be greatest when the decedent died during infancy, bu t
this uncertainty alone should not defeat the plaintiff’s claim. ”
Id. at ___. “Where injury to some degree is found,” courts “d o
not preclude recovery for lack of precise proof.” Id. at ___
(cleaned up). Courts “do not, in the assessment of damages,
require a mathematical precision in situations of injury where,
from the very nature of the circumstances, precision i s
unattainable.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation s
omitted). “Particularly is this true where it is defendant’s ow n
act or neglect that has caused the imprecision.” Id. at __ _
(cleaned up).
3. Lost-Earning-Capacity Damages
“Lost earning capacity refers to wages a person could hav e
earned but for the accident, and is the same thing as lost futur e
earnings[.]” Demott v VHS Harper-Hutzel Hosp, Inc, ___ Mic h
App ___, ___ n 2 (2025) (quotation marks and citation s
omitted). However, lost-earning-capacity damages are no t
available under the WDA. See Daher v Prime Healthcare Servs-
Garden City, LLC, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2024) (When th e
Legislature combined the death act and the survival act, th e
newly-combined WDA “revived the common-law rule barrin g
recovery of” lost-earning-capacity damages.); see also Demott,
___ Mich App at ___ (The Daher Court recognized that “the
Legislature did not intend to expand the types of damage s
available under the act to damages that had never historicall y
been available under . . . any version of Michigan’s death act.”).

9.13 Appointment of Interim Administrator
Subchapter 9.300 of the Michigan Court Rules imposes obligations o n
private practice attorneys and the State Bar of Michigan with regard t o
identifying, designating, and serving as Interim Administrators when an
attorney becomes unable to practice. This may require the court to rul e
on an ex parte petition for the appointment of an interim administrator.
See MCR 9.305.
61
A. Commencement of Proceedings
“A proceeding for the appointment of an Interim Administrator i s
commenced by the filing of an ex parte petition by the Interi m
Administrator in the circuit court for the county in which th e
Affected Attorney lives, last lived, or maintains or last maintained
an office for the practice of law.” MCR 9.305(A). “If an Interi m
Administrator is unable to serve, he or she must promptly notify the
State Bar, and the State Bar must promptly identify a replacemen t
Interim Administrator using the list maintained by the State Bar
under Rule 21(C) of the Rules Concerning the State Bar of Michiga n
or its own staff under attorney supervision as a measure of las t
resort.” MCR 9.305(A).
Petition Requirements. “The petition must set forth facts provin g
that the attorney is an Affected Attorney[.]” MCR 9.305(A)(1)(a).
The petition must also set forth facts proving that “the appointmen t
of an Interim Administrator is necessary to protect the interests of
the Affected Attorney’s Clients or the interests of the Affecte d
Attorney” and that “the attorney proposed to be appointed a s
Interim Administrator is qualified under [MCR 9.305].” MCR
9.305(A)(1)(b)-(c). Finally, the petition “must be verified or
accompanied by an affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury
of a person having personal knowledge of the facts.” MCR
9.305(A)(2).
Service of Process. “The petition and any supporting document s
must be served upon the Affected Attorney if the whereabouts of
the Affected Attorney are known, the Affected Attorney’s estate if
the Affected Attorney has died, and on the fiduciary for the
Affected Attorney, if one has been appointed. See MCR 2.103 –
2.108. If the petition is filed by the Designated Interi m
Administrator, it must also be served upon the State Bar of

9.14 Application to Pending Actions of Newly Adopted or
Previous Version of Court Rule
A. Generally
“There is no bright-line rule for determining when an amended or
previous version of a rule applies; rather, the court must look more
closely to the particular circumstances of the case at issue and at the
purpose of the amendment.” Webster v Osguthorpe, ___ Mich ___,
___ (2025) (quotation marks and citation omitted). However, “the
question of whether a newly amended or adopted court rule applie s
is governed by MCR 1.102 because it provides its own specific rule s
for the application of new and amended court rules that should take
precedence over the generalized rules of retrospectivity and
prospectivity.” Webster, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and
citation omitted). MCR 1.102 states:
“These rules take effect on March 1, 1985. They gover n
all proceedings in actions brought on or after that date,
and all further proceedings in actions then pending. A
court may permit a pending action to proceed under th e
former rules if it finds that the application of these rule s
to that action would not be feasible or would wor k
injustice.”
“Although the rule explicitly addresses the initial adoption of the
modern court rules in 1985, those principles from MCR 1.102 hav e
been applied not only to the initial adoption of the rules, but also t o
later adopted or amended rules.” Webster, ___ Mich at ___ (cleane d
up). “That is, a newly adopted court rule will not be applied t o
pending actions if a party acts, or fails to act, in reliance on the prior
rules and the party’s action or inaction has consequences under the
new rules that were not present under the old rules.” Id. at __ _
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-111
=== Page 564 ===
Section 9.14 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
(cleaned up) (noting that “the norm is to apply the newly adopted
court rules to pending actions unless there is reason to continue
applying the old rules”) (quotation marks and citation omitted).
“MCR 1.102 provides the pertinent analysis because it specifically
permits trial courts to apply former court rules if doing so would
prevent injustice.” Webster, ___ Mich at ___. “The injustice exception
to applying the current rule in MCR 1.102 must be applied narrowl y
and with restraint, such that the exception does not subsume the
rule itself[.]” Webster, ___ Mich at ___ (quotation marks and citatio n
omitted). “An injustice is not present merely because a differen t
result would be reached under the new rules.” Id. at ___ (cleaned
up) (“adopt[ing] the framework announced in Reitmeyer[ v Schultz
Equip & Parts Co, Inc, 237 Mich App 332 (1999),] as the appropriate
guide for trial courts to follow when determining whether to apply
a newly adopted court rule to pending actions”). Accordingly, “a n
individualized determination guided by the nonexhaustive factor s
from Reitmeyer—including timing, purpose of the newly adopted
rule, possible gamesmanship, and reliance—is appropriate give n
that these factors bear on whether injustice would occur.” Webster,
___ Mich at ___.
B. Caselaw: Determining When An Amended or Previous
Version of a Rule Applies
“[T]rial courts should look to Reitmeyer[ v Schultz Equip & Parts Co,
Inc, 237 Mich App 332 (1999),] as the guidepost for determining
whether to apply a newly amended rule to a pending case.” Webste r
v Osguthorpe, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025) (“formally adopt[ing]
Reitmeyer’s analysis to guide the determination of whether to apply
a current or former court rule”). In Webster, “during the pendency of
the litigation, [the] Court amended MCR 2.403 and, while MCR
2.403(O) had previously permitted an award of costs and attorney
fees as sanctions against a losing party who rejects a case-evaluatio n
award (unless the verdict is more favorable to them than the award),
the amendment . . . eliminated the availability of case-evaluation
sanctions altogether.” Webster, ___ Mich at ___ (citation omitted).
“The trial court appropriately cited the test from Reitmeyer,
explaining that because of the court-rule change during the
pendency of the case, the current version of the rule ‘applies unles s
the result thereunder would work an injustice.’” Id. at ___. “The
court found significant that case evaluation occurred more than a
year before the rule change.” Id. at ___. “Also significant was tha t
before the change became effective, the parties attended multiple
settlement conferences, participated in a facilitation session, and
had three different trial dates.” Id. at ___. Accordingly, the trial cour t
“found that plaintiff’s decisions to proceed to trial were made i n
Page 9-112 Michigan Judicial Institute
=== Page 565 ===
Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition Section 9.14
reliance on the availability of sanctions under the former rule suc h
that justice favored its application.” Id. at ___.
“Reitmeyer instructs that one factor guiding the determination i s
whether applying the amended rule furthers its purpose given the
timing of events in the case.” Webster, ___ Mich at ___. “On e
purpose of eliminating case-evaluation sanctions was to level the
playing field, particularly given that the process often benefitte d
defendants who could absorb costs across multiple cases.” Id. at ___ .
“Another reason was that stakeholders felt that case evaluatio n
would often force settlements divorced from the merits of the
claims.” Id. at ___. In Webster, “all the actions that could affec t
whether to award case-evaluation sanctions occurred before the
amendment became effective.” Id. at ___ (noting that “cas e
evaluation occurred more than a year before the rule change”).
“Accordingly, because of the timing of events in the case, the goal s
of the amendment would not have been furthered.” Id. at ___.
“Relatedly, the trial court should look to the parties’ reliance or lack
of reliance on the rules that existed when they made pertinen t
strategic decisions.” Id. at ___. “[O]ne could find that plaintiff had
every reason to believe that if the case went to trial, the trial would
be over and any sanctions would be awarded under the old cour t
rules.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted) (rejectin g
defendants’ argument “that, because the trial had not yet occurred
by the date the amendment was effective, former MCR 2.403(O) wa s
not applicable” considering that “the parties prepared for trial
numerous times leading up to the rule change”).
“Reitmeyer also directs the trial court to look to the plaintiff’ s
obvious gamesmanship or lack thereof.” Webster, ___ Mich a t
___ n 7. “However, unlike the amendments of MCR 2.405, case-
evaluation sanctions were not removed to avoid gamesmanship.”
Webster, ___ Mich at ___ n 7. “Nor [was] there any argument that th e
delays in [Webster] were caused by gamesmanship.” Id. “So, the tria l
court appropriately did not consider this factor.” Id. “Applying th e
considerations from Reitmeyer, . . . the trial court did not abuse it s
discretion by awarding case-evaluation sanctions to plaintiff under
former MCR 2.403(O).” Webster, ___ Mich at ___ (“[B]ecaus e
defendants rejected the case-evaluation award and the verdict wa s
not more favorable to defendants than the award, plaintiff [was]
entitled to sanctions under the conditions of MCR 2.403(O) as it was
applied.”).
C. Standard of Review
A trial court’s decision regarding the application of a newly adopted
court rule to a pending action is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
Webster v Osguthorpe, ___ Mich ___, ___ (2025). “Abuse-of-discretion
Michigan Judicial Institute Page 9-113
=== Page 566 ===
Section 9.14 Civil Proceedings Benchbook - Second Edition
review is generally appropriate when a decision requires familiarity
with the facts of the case and experience in maintaining a trial cour t
docket.” Id. at ___ (cleaned up). “Relatedly, abuse-of-discretio n
review is appropriate when a question is not primarily legal bu t
instead grows out of, and is bounded by, case-specific detailed
factual circumstances.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation
omitted). “A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision fall s
outside the range of reasonable and principled outcomes.” Id. at __ _
(quotation marks and citation omitted). “A trial court necessarily
abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.” Id. at ___
(quotation marks and citation omitted) (“We cannot say that there
was an abuse of discretion when the trial court correctly applied
MCR 1.102 and Reitmeyer[ v Schultz Equip & Parts Co, Inc, 237 Mic h
App 332 (1999)].”). “The factual findings undergirding these
[nonexhaustive Reitmeyer] factors are reviewed for clear error. ”
Webster, ___ Mich at ___ n 8 (“We find no clear error in the trial
court’s findings of fact.”).
In Webster, “the Court of Appeals appeared to conduct a de nov o
analysis of whether application of the current rule would work a n
injustice under MCR 1.102.” Webster, ___ Mich at ___ (noting tha t
“the appropriate standard for reviewing the trial court’s decision i s
the abuse-of-discretion standard”). “While the Court of Appeal s
arguably analyzed pertinent factors in the individual case, it failed
to contend with the articulated reasons for the trial court’s decisio n
within the Reitmeyer framework.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks an d
citation omitted). “Moreover, the trial court’s decision to apply
former MCR 2.403(O) was not outside the range of reasonable and
principled outcomes considering the specific facts of [the] case.”
Webster, ___ Mich at ___. “Merely because a denial of sanctions ma y
have been supportable does not mean that the trial court abused it s
discretion by allowing sanctions.” Id. at ___. “The trial court did no t
simply rely on the fact that a different result would be obtained
from applying the current rule.” Id. at ___. “Instead, it appropriately
considered plaintiff’s reliance interests and the timing of the rule
change to conclude that application of the former rule would work
injustice.” Id. at ___ (quotation marks and citation omitted)
(“hold[ing] that the trial court had discretion to apply the former
court rule under MCR 1.102 and did not abuse that discretion”).
