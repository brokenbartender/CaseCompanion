Dear Mr. Parrott,
I am writing to you in your capacity as the Managing Broker for Expert Realty Solutions regarding one of your licensed
agents, Jeffery Snyder.
This is to formally put your brokerage on notice regarding a violent, unprovoked assault committed by Mr. Snyder on
August 20, 2025 (OCSO Report #25-195158 / Criminal Case #2025-251105SM-SM). The incident resulted in my
hospitalization at Trinity Health with a significant shoulder injury and over $14,000 in medical damages.
Furthermore, this assault led directly to my retaliatory termination from my place of employment, which I am currently
litigating. I have initiated a series of administrative and civil actions against all parties involved, including:
MLCC and City Clerk complaints regarding the premises safety.
MIOSHA and MDCR filings regarding the workplace violence and subsequent discharge.
A formal civil demand for assault, battery, and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
I believe it is in your best interest to be aware of the criminal and civil liability currently surrounding your agent. His
conduct reflects a significant breach of the "good moral character" requirements for Michigan real estate licensure, and I
will be ensuring that LARA is fully briefed on the outcome of his upcoming criminal proceedings.
Sincerely,
Cody McKenzie
