Dear Mr. Linardos,
Please be advised that the settlement offer sent via certified mail on December 30, 2025, is officially withdrawn and
null/void due to non-delivery and the expiration of the January 6th deadline. Electronic service of this amended demand
is deemed effective notice.
As of this afternoon, the following agencies have been formally notified of your client’s conduct: Michigan LARA (BPL),
GMAR (Ethics), Expert Realty Solutions (Broker Joel Parrott), and Federal OSHA.
To resolve this matter before the 9:00 AM hearing tomorrow, my final demand is as follows:
1. $30,000.00 (Net to Plaintiff): Payment must be made via Cashier's Check or Law Firm Trust Account Check.
2. Lien Satisfaction & Defense: Your client must directly satisfy all outstanding medical liens (Trinity
Health/Medicaid) related to OCSO #25-195158. Further, your client shall defend, indemnify, and hold me
harmless from any and all subrogation claims or collection actions arising from these medical costs.
3. Mutual Non-Disparagement: A standard mutual non-disparagement clause will be included to protect the
professional reputations of all parties.
4. Affidavit of Satisfaction: Upon the clearing of funds, I will execute a "Civil Compromise" affidavit pursuant to
MCL 767.41, informing the Court and the Prosecutor that I have received full satisfaction for my injuries. I will also
provide a "Letter of Resolution" to LARA and GMAR.
This offer expires at 8:30 AM tomorrow, January 8, 2026.
If this matter is not resolved by the time the Court convenes, I will proceed with full prosecution and file a civil complaint
for $100,000+ in exemplary damages, including a lis pendens against your client’s real estate assets and a motion to
ensure the LARA and GMAR investigations proceed to a final board determination.
Sincerely,
Cody McKenzie
