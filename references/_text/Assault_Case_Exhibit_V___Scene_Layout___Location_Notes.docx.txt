Exhibit V — Scene Layout / Location Notes
Location of Incident: Interior corridor/vestibule area inside Liberty Bar
Purpose:
This exhibit documents the physical layout of the area where the August 20, 2025 assault occurred. It provides spatial context for the video evidence, witness positioning, and the sequence of events captured in Exhibits A and B.
------------------------------------------------------------
1. GENERAL LOCATION DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
• The incident occurred in a narrow interior corridor/vestibule area of Liberty Bar.
• Lighting consisted of neon purple/blue tones in Video 1 and pink/red tones in Video 2.
• The space is enclosed, with limited room for movement.
• An illuminated EXIT sign is visible in Video 2, indicating the aggressor’s proximity to an available escape route.
------------------------------------------------------------
2. PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE AREA
------------------------------------------------------------
• Narrow walkway with limited lateral space.
• Hard flooring surface, increasing impact force during restraint and kicking.
• Walls on both sides restrict movement and create a confined environment.
• Low‑light conditions, but sufficient visibility to identify actions, posture, and audio.
• The EXIT sign is positioned directly behind the aggressor during the confrontation in Video 2.
------------------------------------------------------------
3. POSITIONING OF INDIVIDUALS
------------------------------------------------------------
Cody (Restrainer / Male Victim):
• Positioned on top of the aggressor during Video 1 to prevent further violence.
• Located in the center of the corridor.
• After the restraint breaks, Cody is pushed backward into the narrow walkway.
Shelby (Female Victim):
• Positioned against the wall during police arrival.
• Visible in Video 1 after the restraint sequence.
• In Video 2, she moves toward a bystander to secure a witness.
Aggressor:
• Initially prone on the floor during restraint.
• Positioned directly beneath Cody.
• After breaking free, stands beside the EXIT sign.
• Faces toward Cody and Shelby, not toward the exit.
Bystanders:
• Positioned near the corridor entrance.
• One bystander records the incident.
• Another is asked by Shelby to “watch this” to ensure witness corroboration.
------------------------------------------------------------
4. RELEVANT LOCATION OBSERVATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
• The aggressor had a clear and unobstructed path to the exit once standing.
• Despite this, he chose to turn back toward the victims and escalate.
• The confined space increased the danger to Cody during the restraint.
• The lighting does not obscure the aggressor’s movements, admissions, or aggression.
• The corridor layout supports the timeline of events shown in both videos.
------------------------------------------------------------
5. SIGNIFICANCE FOR PROSECUTION
------------------------------------------------------------
• Confined space explains Cody’s need to maintain a controlled restraint.
• The aggressor’s refusal to retreat, despite standing beside the exit, demonstrates continued aggression.
• The EXIT sign’s visibility confirms the aggressor had a safe escape route but chose confrontation.
• Witness positioning supports the credibility of the recorded events.
• The physical environment is consistent with the injuries described by Cody.
------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
------------------------------------------------------------
The scene layout confirms that the assault occurred in a confined corridor where Cody acted defensively to protect Shelby and prevent further harm. The aggressor’s actions, including kicking, resisting, and re‑engaging after standing, are fully consistent with the spatial limitations and the video evidence.
