Dispatched
INFORMATION:
On 8/20/25 Deputies were dispatched to 85 N Saginaw (Liberty Bar) for a report of a male who
assaulted a customer and an employee. Upon arrival I observed a male later identified as Jeffery
Snyder laying on the ground inside near the back door of the bar. He appeared obviously
intoxicated. I asked Jeffery to come outside and speak with me.
Deputy Kirkland spoke with bar staff and customers.
SUMMARY OF INTERVIEW WITH JEFFERY SNYDER:
The following is not verbatim.
I spoke with Jeffery outside on the back patio of the bar. Jeffery stated he went to the bar alone.
He stated had approximately 4-5 drinks. Jeffery said he was sitting at the bar when a female who
was later identified as Shelby Herron approached him and got in his face. The two go two got
into an argument and Jeffery threw his drink (which contained alcohol) at Shelby. Jeffery agreed
when I asked him if he should have removed himself from the situation before it escalated.

VIDEO OF INCIDENT:
The bar owner (Brett) showed me in house video on his cell phone. I observe the time stamp to
be accurate with the current time. The argument appears to start at 11:54 however, the video
suddenly skips ahead, and the involved individuals cannot be seen on the video. I provided Brett
with my email address and asked him to forward me the video when he has a chance to watch it
on a computer.
ACTION TAKEN:
Jeffery was placed under arrest for assault. He was placed in handcuffs and secured in patrol car
8929. He was transported to the Oakland County Jail where he was lodged pending
arraignment.
Jeffery does not have any prior convictions.

INFORMATION:
On Wednesday August 20, 2025, at approximately 2355 hours, Deputy Asaro and I were
dispatched to Liberty Bar (85 N. Saginaw) in reference to an assault and battery complaint.
OBSERVATION:
Deputy Asaro and I arrived and walked into the rear entrance of the bar. There was an adult
male lying on the ground inside of a hallway, inside the bar. Two other employees were cleaning

the area and going back and forth with the male who was lying on the ground. The male lying
down was obviously intoxicated.
Deputy Asaro began speaking with the intoxicated male, and I spoke to the bartender, Cody
Mckenzie.
Interview with Victim (Cody Mckenzie):
Cody said that while he was bartending, one of his regular customers began getting into a verbal
altercation with another patron. Cody said that an argument broke out at which point the male
threw a beer on the other patron. Cody said that the female then "blacked out" and went towards
the male aggressively. Cody said that the male punched the female multiple times in the face.
Cody said that he attempted to break up the fight at which time all three parties stumbled towards
the hallway. Eventually Cody was able to separate the two parties, but not before the male also
punched Cody multiple times. Cody said after the fight was done, he kept the two parties
separated until police arrived. Cody stated that he did want to press charges. (Statement
attached)
INTERVIEW WITH VICTIM (SHELBY HERRON):
Herron said that a random male began by coming over and hitting on her friend that she was
with. Herron's friend denied the male's advances, causing the male to become frustrated. Herron
said that she had words with the male, who was standing adjacent to the bar and where Herron
was sitting. Herron said that the male called her friend Ugly, and that he would be alone for the
rest of his life. The made Herron angry, to which she made a derogatory statement toward the
male. Herron said that the male then threw a beer all over her and her friend, at which point she
became so angry that she blacked out. Herron said that she remembers the male punching her
multiple times in the face and breaking her nails. Herron stated that she did want to press
charges. (Statement attached)
ACTION TAKEN:
I took statements from the victims. The decision was made to place the male, Jeffrey Snyder,
under arrest for assault and battery. Deputy Asaro secured the male in cuffs and escorted him to
our patrol vehicle. Jeffrey was searched and placed into our patrol car. I transported Jeffrey to
OCJ for housing.
