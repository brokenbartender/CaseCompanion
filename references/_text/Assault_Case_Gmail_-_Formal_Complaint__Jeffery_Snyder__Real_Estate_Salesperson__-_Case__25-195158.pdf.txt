Dear Bureau of Professional Licensing,
I am filing a formal complaint against Jeffery Snyder, a licensed Real Estate Salesperson (Licensee Name: Jeffery
Snyder, Brokerage: Expert Realty Solutions Inc), for a violation of the Michigan Occupational Code.
Under Section 604(d) of the Code, a licensee is subject to penalty for "demonstrating a lack of good moral character." On
August 20, 2025, Jeffery Snyder was involved in a violent physical assault at Liberty Bar (85 N Saginaw St, Pontiac),
which has been documented by the Oakland County Sheriff's Office under Case #25-195158.
During the incident, Mr. Snyder physically assaulted a female patron and hit multiple people in the face before being
restrained until law enforcement arrived. This violent conduct is directly contrary to the high standards of integrity and
moral conduct required of a licensed real estate professional in this state.
I have attached a screenshot of a witness statement from another victim Shelby Herron confirming the assault and his
aggressive behavior. Video evidence of the assault, recorded by a witness named Justin, is also available for your
investigation.
I request that the Bureau initiate a formal investigation into Mr. Snyder's fitness to hold a professional license in Michigan.
Sincerely,
Cody McKenzie
