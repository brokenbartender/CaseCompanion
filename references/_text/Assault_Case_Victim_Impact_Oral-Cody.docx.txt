Your Honor, on August 20th, 2025, while I was working at Liberty Bar, I was assaulted by Jeffery Snyder. I stepped in to protect a female patron he was attacking, and during the struggle there was a moment where everything went black. I came back to myself while holding him down on the floor. That moment has stayed with me, and it was the first time I ever felt unsafe in a place where I was supposed to be in control.
Physically, I ended up in the ER with a shoulder contusion and needed medication for pain and anxiety. For weeks I struggled with basic movement, and I still have discomfort today.
Emotionally, this incident changed how I function. I deal with anxiety, panic symptoms, and hypervigilance. Loud noises or sudden movements can trigger stress, and I’ve had to rely on medication to manage it. I no longer feel safe in the kind of work environment I used to handle confidently.
Financially, I missed work and lost income. I was later fired while still dealing with the effects of the assault, which created a lot of instability in my life. Even with insurance, I had out‑of‑pocket costs and transportation expenses while trying to recover.
I didn’t provoke this. I was doing my job and trying to protect someone who was being harmed. This assault has affected my physical health, my emotional well‑being, and my financial stability. I ask the Court to consider the full impact of this incident when making decisions in this case.
Thank you, Your Honor.
