My name is Cody McKenzie. I am writing to formally report a workplace injury and a subsequent retaliatory termination. My
employer has legally failed to report this injury to the Agency or their insurance carrier. I am requesting the Agency’s
immediate intervention to identify the liable carrier and facilitate my claim.
1. LIABLE EMPLOYER & MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE I assert that the following individuals/entities are jointly responsible
for the failure to report this injury under the Michigan Workers' Disability Compensation Act:
Establishment: Liberty Bar & Poutinerie / LBP Entertainment
Address: 85 N Saginaw St, Pontiac, MI 48342
Operator / Liquor License Holder: Kent Piatt. Mr. Piatt is the legally liable operator who executed my termination.
Manager in Charge (Time of Injury): Brett Nicholson. Mr. Nicholson was the acting manager on duty during the
assault and failed to initiate the required injury report.
2. INCIDENT OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE (CRIMINAL) On August 20, 2025, I sustained injuries arising out of and in the
course of my employment at Liberty Bar.
Nature of Incident: I was physically assaulted by Jeffrey Joseph Snyder (Owner/Affiliate).
Criminal Verification: This was a unilateral act of violence, not a mutual dispute. The severity is confirmed by the
active criminal prosecution in the 50th District Court - Pontiac.
Case Details:
Case ID: 2025-251105SM-SM.
Defendant: Jeffrey Joseph Snyder.
Charge: Assault and Battery (Statute 750.81).
Offense Date: 08/20/2025.
Status: OPEN. A Pre-Trial hearing is scheduled for January 8, 2026, before Judge Jeremy Darnell Bowie.
3. STATUTORY VIOLATIONS & RETALIATION Despite the documented police involvement and criminal charges filed on
August 21, 2025, the employer failed to fulfill their statutory obligations:
Failure to Report: Brett Nicholson (Owner) was aware of the assault immediately but failed to report the injury to the
Workers' Compensation Agency.
Retaliatory Termination: On October 17, 2025—approximately two months after the assault—the Operator, Kent
Piatt, terminated my employment without cause. I allege this termination was direct retaliation for the liabilities created
by the assault and the resulting hostile work environment.
4. REQUEST FOR AGENCY ACTION I respectfully request that the Agency:
1. Identify the Carrier: Provide me with the name and policy number of the Workers' Compensation insurance carrier for
Kent Piatt / LBP Entertainment valid on August 20, 2025.
2. Enforce Compliance: Investigate this employer for violation of the Act regarding the failure to report a known injury
involving criminal violence.

Cody,
Thank you for reaching out to the WDCA. You have two options to pursue your workers’ compensation claim
through the WDCA. You can complete an Application for Mediation, which is attached. This is an informal
telephone mediation process. It is a three-way call with the mediator, you, and the claim representative. The
other option is to hire an attorney and have the case go directly to a magistrate. It appears that some of the
issues you mention below may be beyond the scope of our telephone mediation process, but I would be happy
to discuss the options with you further. Please feel free to reach out to me. The Application does need to be
submitted by mail.
Carrier information for Liberty is listed below.
