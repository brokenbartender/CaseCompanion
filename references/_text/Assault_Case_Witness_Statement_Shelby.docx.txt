Statement
My name is Shelby Herron, and I am providing this statement regarding the assault that occurred at Liberty Bar on the night of August 20th, 2025.
While I was inside the bar, a male customer wearing a black shirt became aggressive toward me without any provocation. He threw his drink on me, and during the confrontation that followed, he struck me in the face. I did not hit him first. His actions caused me to feel scared, shocked, and unsafe.
After he hit me, Cody McKenzie stepped in to protect me and to stop the situation from getting worse. The attacker continued to act aggressively, and Cody restrained him on the ground until the police could arrive. During this time, the attacker was yelling, threatening Cody, and trying to get up. I saw him twisting, kicking, and trying to break free from Cody’s hold.
At one point, I asked a bystander to watch and record what was happening because I was afraid the attacker would try to leave or deny what he had done. I said, “I need you to watch this, please,” because I wanted to make sure there was a witness to his behavior.
When the attacker managed to get up, he did not leave even though he was standing right next to the exit. Instead, he turned back toward us, yelling and acting aggressively. Cody told people in the hallway that the attacker had punched me in the face. The attacker did not deny this and continued yelling profanity.
I was shaken and scared throughout the incident. I stayed near the wall and away from the attacker while waiting for the police to arrive. I cooperated fully with officers when they came.
Everything in this statement is true to the best of my knowledge and reflects what I personally saw, experienced, and said during the incident.
