Refined Video Analysis Summary (Court‑Ready)
Video Conditions
The footage is recorded in a low‑light hallway with strong purple/blue neon lighting. This lighting obscures fine details such as bruising or discoloration. The video begins after the initial assault; the attacker is already on the ground when recording starts.
1. Timeline (Second‑by‑Second)
00:00 – 00:15
The attacker is prone on the floor.
You are kneeling over him, applying controlled weight to keep him pinned.
Attacker: “You’re gonna get sued so bad.”
You: “You’re still threatening me.”
00:16 – 00:30
Attacker struggles lightly.
You: “You’re being detained until the f***ing police get here.”
Shelby: “They said they’re on their way.”
00:30 – 00:45
Attacker: “She was being so mean to me!”
You: “Get what? Thrown the f*** out?”
Attacker: “She was being so rude… that’s why I threw my drink on her.”
First admission of battery.
00:45 – 01:00
You: “And then you punched her in the face?”
Attacker: “I threw a drink at her because she was being nasty!”
He does not deny the punch; he justifies his aggression.
01:00 – 01:35
Attacker repeats: “She was being mean to me,” “Get off me.”
You maintain the pin and explain that throwing a drink and hitting someone is assault/battery.
01:36 – 01:45
Attacker briefly denies hitting her, then immediately returns to “She was being mean.”
You clarify: “You assaulted her, she hit you, and then you hit her.”
01:50 – 02:15
Attacker becomes more agitated.
You: “Stop trying to f***ing get up.”
You state his movements are making you feel unsafe.
02:22 – 02:26 — Physical Escalation
Attacker: “Get off me!”
He violently bucks upward, thrusting his legs backward toward you.
You stumble but maintain control.
You: “Try to kick me one more time! Do it!”
02:30
Bystander: “Here’s the cops.”
02:31 – 02:35
Camera pans to Shelby, standing against the wall, visibly shaken.
02:36
Video ends as police arrive.
2. Assault Details
Strikes to Shelby (Verbal Evidence)
00:43 — Attacker: “I threw my drink on her.”
01:25 — You: “And then you punched her in the face.”
Attacker does not deny; he justifies.
Strikes to You (Visual Evidence)
02:23 – 02:25 — Attacker bucks violently.
His legs/feet strike or attempt to strike your lower body.
You lose balance momentarily but do not fall.
3. Injury‑Relevant Observations
Shoulder/Back Strain
You maintain a physical pin on a resisting adult male for the entire video.
His twisting and upward force require constant downward pressure — consistent with shoulder, back, and trapezius strain.
Leg/Knee Trauma
At 02:23, his kick/buck is directed at your lower body.
Lighting prevents seeing bruising, but the mechanics match blunt‑force trauma.
Disorientation
You remain coherent.
The attacker appears intoxicated: slurred speech, inconsistent tone, poor motor control.
4. Behavior Analysis
Attacker
Escalation: Threats → justification → physical resistance.
Lack of remorse: Repeatedly blames Shelby being “mean.”
Intoxication: Slurred speech, erratic behavior.
You (Restrainer)
Defensive/Protective: Clearly state intent to wait for police.
De‑escalation: Keep him talking, explain why he’s detained.
Controlled force: Only enough to keep him down; no retaliation.
Shelby
Appears shaken, stays near wall, avoids attacker.
5. Key Evidence for Law Enforcement
00:43 — Admission of Battery
“I threw my drink on her.”
00:43 – 01:00 — Motive
He repeatedly states he acted because she was “mean,” showing retaliation, not self‑defense.
02:22 – 02:25 — Assault on You
Active resistance and attempted kicking while detained.
00:26 & 02:30 — Notice of Police
