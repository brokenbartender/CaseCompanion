Witness Statement of Cody Elis McKenzie
Date: January 05, 2026
On August 20, 2025, at approximately 11:55 PM, I was performing my professional duties as a
bartender at Liberty Bar (LBP Entertainment) located at 85 N. Saginaw St., Pontiac, MI. During
my shift, I observed a male customer, later identified as Jeffery Snyder, engage in a verbal
altercation with a female patron, Shelby Herron.
The situation escalated when Mr. Snyder threw a beer on Ms. Herron and her friend and began
physically assaulting her. I observed Mr. Snyder punch Ms. Herron multiple times in the face.
Seeing a patron in immediate physical danger, I intervened to protect Ms. Herron and stop the
assault.
As I attempted to separate the parties and move them toward a hallway to de-escalate the
situation, Mr. Snyder turned his aggression toward me. He punched me multiple times in the
head and body, causing me to stumble into the hallway. Despite the attack, I managed to
maintain separation between the parties until deputies from the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office
arrived on the scene.
Immediately following the incident, I experienced significant pain in my right shoulder and lower
back, as well as acute anxiety. Owner Brett Nicholson arrived at the scene shortly after the
assault and provided surveillance video of the incident to the responding deputies. I sought
emergency medical treatment at Trinity Health Oakland later that night.
