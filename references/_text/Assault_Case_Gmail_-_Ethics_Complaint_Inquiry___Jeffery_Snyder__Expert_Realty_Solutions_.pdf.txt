Dear Pauline,
I am writing to the Greater Metropolitan Association of Realtors (GMAR) to inquire about the process for filing a formal
ethics complaint against a member, Jeffery Snyder, for conduct that violates the Realtor Code of Ethics.
Mr. Snyder is currently a defendant in an active criminal assault case in Oakland County (Case #2025-251105SM-SM)
stemming from a violent, unprovoked attack on August 20, 2025. This incident resulted in my hospitalization and severe
economic loss, including the loss of my livelihood.
I am aware that GMAR members are held to a higher standard of professional and personal conduct. I believe Mr.
Snyder's actions constitute a violation of the "Conduct Unbecoming" standards and potentially Article 10 or 15 of the
Code of Ethics, depending on his representations during this dispute.
Could you please provide the necessary forms and instructions to ensure this matter is brought before the Grievance
Committee for review? I have the police reports and medical documentation ready for submission.
Thank you for your time and for maintaining the integrity of the profession.
Best regards,
Cody McKenzie
