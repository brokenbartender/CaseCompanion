Case Name: State of Michigan v. Jeffery Joseph Snyder
Case Number: 2025‑251105SM‑SM
Court: 50th District Court, Pontiac, MI
Judge: Hon. Jeremy Darnell Bowie
Victim: Shelby Herron
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE BOWIE:
On August 20, 2025, I was assaulted by Jeffery Snyder while I was sitting at the bar with a friend. What began as an uncomfortable interaction quickly escalated into violence. After my friend and I told him we weren’t interested in talking to him, he threw a drink on us. Before I could react, he punched me multiple times in the face. Parts of the incident are still a blur, and I remember feeling shocked, overwhelmed, and scared.
Physical Impact
I had bruising, broken nails, and soreness for days after the assault. While the physical injuries eventually healed, the emotional impact has lasted much longer.
Emotional and Psychological Impact
Since the incident, I have struggled with fear and anxiety in public places. I used to feel comfortable going out with friends, but now I am constantly on edge around strangers, especially in crowded or loud environments. Sudden movements or raised voices make me tense up, and I’ve had trouble sleeping because I keep replaying what happened. The sense of safety I once had has been replaced with worry and hypervigilance.
Life Impact
This assault changed how I move through the world. I am more cautious, more anxious, and less trusting. What happened that night has stayed with me, and I am still working through the emotional effects.
Closing
I did nothing to provoke this situation. I was simply out with a friend, and Mr. Snyder’s actions caused harm that I am still dealing with months later. I respectfully ask the Court to consider the impact this assault has had on my safety, my well‑being, and my daily life.
Thank you for taking the time to hear my statement.
Respectfully,
Shelby Herron
