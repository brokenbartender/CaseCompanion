Dear Mr. Linardos,
I am writing to you regarding the criminal matter of State of Michigan v. Jeffery Joseph Snyder (Case #2025-251105SM-
SM / OCSO Report #25-195158).
Please be advised that I am prepared to initiate a formal civil action in the Oakland County Circuit Court against your
client for Assault, Battery, and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. To ensure a comprehensive filing, I have
already secured the official police report and initiated FOIA requests for all Body-Worn Camera (BWC) footage, patrol
vehicle audio/video, and 911 dispatch recordings from the night of August 20, 2025.
Your client’s unprovoked violence and subsequent arrest resulted in documented damages including, but not limited to:
Aggravated Physical Trauma: A right shoulder contusion requiring emergency intervention at Trinity Health
Oakland. My injuries were sustained while performing the necessary and lawful duty of protecting a female patron
from your client’s unprovoked physical attack.
Documented Medical Management: ER discharge instructions and follow-up care necessitated the use of
Robaxin (muscle relaxant) and Alprazolam (Xanax) to manage acute, assault-related anxiety and PTSD
symptoms.
Economic Disruption & Loss of Livelihood: As an entrepreneur and the owner of an entertainment company,
the physical limitations and psychological trauma caused by this assault have directly interfered with my capacity
to operate my business and fulfill professional obligations.
We are fully aware of Mr. Snyder’s extensive real estate holdings in Oakland County. Be advised that a civil judgment in
this matter will include the filing of a lis pendens against his property assets, which will remain as a cloud on his titles
until the judgment is satisfied in full.
Settlement Offer: In the interest of a "global resolution" before the January 8th Showcause Hearing, I am offering a
one-time opportunity to settle all civil claims for a lump-sum payment of $20,000.
If a settlement agreement is executed and payment is initiated by January 6, 2026, I will inform the Court and the
Prosecutor that the victim has been made whole civilly. This offer is valid for seven (7) days. If we do not reach an
agreement by this deadline, the offer is withdrawn. We will then proceed with a formal filing seeking the maximum
allowable damages, including exemplary damages for the outrageous and willful nature of your client's conduct.
Sincerely,
Cody McKenzie
