                     Table of Contents

I. Introduction                                                                             Page 4

      A short discussion of what a good Trial Notebook should be, why you should
      always use one, and a litmus test of qualities to help make yours the best.

II. Basic Structure                                                                         Page 9

      Though there are many different areas of law, several types of court, and two
      sides to every argument, there are quite a number of features common to all
      trials. In this section we cover basic trial notebook structure as well as a list of
      some of the forms and checklists you’ll find in the sections that follow.

III. Useful Content                                                                         Page 13

      Where would our manners be if we didn’t provide some of the detailed forms,
      checklists, and additional tips on assembling a trial notebook that not only works
      well in hardcopy format but also in softcopy? In this portion you’ll find cover
      sheets for your notebook sections as well as a few of our forms from The
      Attorney Case File to help you in organizing material for your trial.

IV. Putting it All Together                                                                 Page 34

We started with an overview of good Trial Notebook qualities, gave examples of
the contents a thorough one should have and then gave you forms to get you
started. However, the difference is in the detail and we want to give you the
detail that will make all the difference. Here we’ll cover additional tips on how to
make your Trial Notebook all it can be and to make your day in court a success.

V. About the Source                                                                         Page 42

This ebook is only a small portion of what’s available. There is more to show you
so we added this small section to tell you about the much bigger picture.

I. Introduction

      Welcome to the Trial Notebook ebook; a short excerpt from part of “The Attorney Case File” system.

      Based on the stats from our website, most visitors arrive after having searched for information on how
      to construct a Trial Notebook, so here we are, doing a little more to help you with your law office, case
      management, and trial preparation needs.

      Though just the tip of the iceberg, we’ve packed a lot into this short work. We’re going to cover some of
      the basics of a Trial Notebook; we’ll throw in a few useful forms from our system, provide some rather
      useful tips, and then finish up with helpful insight into the final construction and “polish” for making
      yours the best Trial Notebook it can be.

      If you are fairly new to the industry, let’s settle this question: “What exactly is a Trial Notebook?” A
      Trial Notebook is the “brain” of your court appearance. It’s not the folder that holds all your evidence,
      it’s not a collection of court rules or procedures, and it’s not your day planner housing your law office to-
      do lists. It’s it own focused, dedicated organizer for the in-court presentation of the witnesses, exhibits,
      and other information related to one trial and one trial only and if you do it right, it will be pretty much
      worth its weight in gold.

      If you’re a seasoned pro but still say “Well, I can’t see using a Trial Notebook for every case. We’ve
      done pretty well in a lot of our smaller trials without going to all that trouble …” then let’s look at:

          “Top Ten Reasons to Create a Trial Notebook”
          10. The process itself is educational since you have to review your case while putting it together.
          9. It helps you notice billable hours you might have misplaced had you not reviewed.
          8. Nothing will sway a jury against you as quickly as looking disorganized and inept.
          7. If you need to add attorneys for any reason, a good Trial Notebook brings them up to speed.
          6. A good Trial Notebook can streamline your time in court which may win favor or good will.
          5. If you’re support staff and create great Trial Notebooks, you might rule the firm one day!
          4. It shows the Judge, Jury, and Opposition that you’re ready and you mean business!
          3. Organization and readiness instill confidence in the presenting attorney(s).
          2. It also instills confidence in the client (you know… the one writing the checks).
          1. You want to WIN!!

      We all want to win.

                                                                         -4-

It has long been said that good attorneys will not ask a question in court to which they do not already
know the answer.

The answers to these potential questions should have been provided as you worked your case; in the
investigation, legal research, the preliminary proceedings, discovery, and every second leading up to an
appearance in court. The most important question of all, though, is “In court, can you find the
answers you gathered so you know you’re asking the right questions?” Just as important, are
seemingly minor details also organized to the point you don’t miss a single step?

Presenting your case in court is the culmination of all the hard work put forth in its preparation. You’ve
worked hard for your client, investigating the details of the case, performing statutory and case law
research, creating piles of briefs and memos, lining up expert witnesses, communicating with the clerk
of the court, scheduling and calendaring all related activities, accounting for all billable hours, securing
your evidence, creating exhibits, pouring over discovery items, and making sure every I was dotted,
every T was crossed. In all, you want your case presentation to be a work of art, and that’s why we’re
here. We want to give you the framework to help you shine once you get to court.

In just a bit we’ll go through the actual steps you should take in setting up your notebook, but for this
short intro, we’ll discuss the “Litmus Test” or rather the qualities your notebook should have that will
help set you up for success when your case goes to T.R.I.A.L.:

    Thoroughness – Have you included everything you’ll need and then checked it all again?
    Reliability – Accuracy aside, does your notebook format work? Is it softcopy or hardcopy?
    Inquisitiveness – Do your sections and forms prompt you to provide the right info?
    Appearance – Does your Trial Notebook package command respect or is it a mess?
    Logic – Is there a good intuitive flow to the layout of your material? Can you navigate it easily?

Thoroughness
There is nothing so fatal to a court case as a missed detail. While you don’t want to be repetitive, the
more important an event is the more a little redundancy is your friend. You want to include everything
you need, repeat a couple of things here and there, and have some good cross-reference so you don’t
overlook anything. Some thoughts to keep in mind:

       Work from forms, templates, and checklists. Don’t leave anything to chance or memory. You’ll
          find a few of our forms and checklists in the “Useful Content” section.

       Review everything with your client and your presenting attorney(s) as you go along. Waiting
          until the last minute does nothing but ensure missed detail and a nervous client.

                                                                   -5-
           The Trial Notebook – an excerpt from “The Attorney Case File” - Courtesy of InfoQuest

       If you had an outside (or in-house) investigator working with you, have them review with you the
          material they provided so you know all the ins and outs of the information gathered.

       Create an “Index and Reference” section where you make an index like you would find in a text
          book. For example, have one list showing your Document Control numbers in numerical order
          along with the items they represent, list your witnesses in alphabetical order, your e-discovery
          files by name, and list all other electronic file names in alpha-numeric order with a description of
          their contents. In court, you never know what you’ll have to look up.

Reliability
Just how can a notebook be “reliable?” Simple. It’s usable and does everything you would expect. In
this case, the goals are to both house and safeguard all of your pertinent organizational data and intel,
and to be ready to provide that information to you exactly when you need it each and every time. We’ll
cover this in more detail later, but for now, let’s look at some general points:

       The heart of your system should be a hardcopy three-ring binder. Though most offices and
          courts are trying to “go green” and conserve paper, there is a time and a place for a paper-
          based organizer. Trial is that time and place. Binders don’t crash like computers can.

       Though we’re heading in to an all-electronic-file age, the vast majority of us were raised on
          paper-based books and handwritten notes in school and we’re still faster at navigating a tabbed
          notebook than a computer file.

       A hardcopy Trial Notebook is also good in case the computer crashes, or your firm’s computer
          operating system is changed during the course of a lengthy trial. The more important the case,
          the more redundancy is your friend.

       The binder you choose should be durable and hold papers well. It’ll be tossed around on desks
          and tables, scooped up with folios and boxes, and take countless trips in vehicles. You don’t
          want it to show wear easily or spill its contents in the middle of court.

       Similarly, any computer you bring in to court should use a reliable operating system and you
          should have a power cable, a charged battery, and all pertinent accessories.

       Your soft-copy media should also come in a couple of formats just to make sure you can
          reliably access each. Have one copy of the file loaded on your computer and have a CD or
          DVD copy in addition to the files on a “thumb drive” or “flash drive.” We’ll have some related
          tips for computer use under “Putting it All Together.”

Inquisitiveness
You get to ask questions in court. That’s how you get some of your information. A trial would be
useless if you didn’t question anyone or anything. Why? So you don’t miss a single detail. Your Trial
Notebook should do the same for you… provided you set it up right.

                                                                   -6-
The Trial Notebook – an excerpt from “The Attorney Case File” - Courtesy of InfoQuest

 Always work from templates, forms, and checklists. You’ll find examples under “Useful
    Content.” Checklists will help remind you of the information your notebook should house.

 As the saying goes “The dullest pencil has a better memory than the sharpest mind.” – (Author
    Unknown). Your forms will help you remember what to do with final notebook content review,
    on the day of court, and for making sure you have all the main items and support items you’ll
    need to ensure your presentation in court is complete, thorough, organized, and successful.
    The better you are at customizing these checklists, the better off you’ll be. Remember, “When
    in doubt, write it out!” Don’t leave important things to memory. Set your Trial Notebook up so
    that it asks you the right questions before you ask questions in court.

Appearance

People shouldn’t judge a book by its cover but they do.

It’s just a fact of life. For example, your personal

appearance should be as professional as possible,

especially when you’re in front of the client, court, or

opposition. Your Trial Notebook should maintain a

professional appearance as well in order to command       You wouldn’t take this into court would you?
respect from the jury, confidence from your client, and

to intimidate the opposition.

Imagine a disheveled, slovenly looking attorney flipping frantically through a stack of legal pads and

loose papers while the clock ticks and the confused expression on his or her face deepens. Now

imagine a well-dressed, calm, confident, attorney casually referring to a new laptop and doing a quick

cross-check with a tabbed three-ring binder housed in a nice leather cover. Which one of these images

conveys a winner? Think about a few appearance pointers:

 You don’t want to spend too much money on notebooks, but make sure the ones you get look

good and match the folios and binders you bring with you to trial.

 Never use stacks of pads, papers, or “unbound” anything. All paperwork should be in some

sort of binder, folio, or labeled box, and again, they should look like they all came as a set.

 For externally visible labels, use something that looks professional, and make sure they all

match (though you might use different colors for different sections – more on that later).

 Rubber bands have a minimal place in court. Don’t use them if you don’t absolutely have to.

 Neatness counts, even when it’s only your people seeing the contents. This is especially true if

you’re a paralegal preparing this for a partner of a firm. Your work product affects your career.

Make it good and make it count. Make sure all spelling is correct, typestyle (font) is uniform,

grammar is good, the layout follows office protocol (which you should help set), and that all

copy is legible.

Logic
The most thorough and detailed Trial Notebook in the world is going to be useless unless the
presenting attorney can understand the layout and logic of how everything in the notebook is organized.
Consider the following:

       The first consideration is, “Who is the lead or presenting attorney for the trial?” Though your
          firm’s notebooks should be pretty much standardized you still have to consider the nature of the
          type of case being tried followed immediately by the idiosyncrasies of your presenting attorney.
          Do they prefer hardcopy or do they work best from computer? Do they like large print or small
          print? Do they respond well to color-coded / highlighted text or certain symbols like different
          types of bullet points? Has the court issued any edicts concerning trial materials?

       Though one attorney might prefer one certain format over another, you need to keep two things
          in mind. One, there should be some uniformity, and two; your redundant backups should mirror
          each other as much as possible. For example, if the attorney prefers working from an
          electronic copy of the Trial Notebook and the laptop crashes, the hardcopy three-ring binder
          should be laid out in the same fashion as the softcopy version.

       We can’t stress this enough: work from forms, checklists, and templates.
       This also bears repeating: Create an Index & Reference section to give you a secondary way of

          looking up information that you need to locate quickly.
       Though you have a lot of data you gathered for your case, keep in mind that the Trial Notebook

          is not meant to house everything, but rather, it is to be the main organizer or index of your
          materials and an outline of your case. Use other folios, folders, binders, and boxes for the
          “guts” and documents. Keeping the Trial Notebook’s contents concise and to the point makes
          for easier navigation which is much more logical.

Sadly, in such a short ebook we can only                   Could you navigate your way through a

be working either side of civil or criminal, tax
or tort, paternity or product liability, contract or
malpractice, family or corporate. However,
trials do have some foundational elements to
them, so we’ll give you the framework you’ll
need that will help you prepare the best Trial
Notebook you possibly can. Let’s look next at
“Basic Structure.”

II. Basic Structure

As mentioned in the “Introduction,” with anything as important as a trial, redundancy is your friend.
Here under “Basic Structure” we’re going to focus on the contents of a hardcopy notebook, but we’ll
also remind you to organize your softcopy files in the same format. Remember; logical organization is
key to your material being useful in court.

Some offices organize their notebooks by form, others by function, and we’ve even seen some who
choose to do everything in alphabetical order. What we recommend is to organize your sections in
pretty much the same order as they’ll be accessed or used in presenting your case. The following are
offered as suggested tab sections for a hardcopy notebook, but as we’ve said before, your electronic
files should be stored on your computer, CDs / DVDs, and flash drives using an identical folder or
document table of contents layout. Here are our suggested sections:

Title Sheet: Trial Information               A little organization can sometimes
Tabbed Sections:                             help tame the bigger problems!

     1. Pre-Trial
     2. Voir Dire & Jury Info
     3. Opening Statements
     4. Presentation Schedule
     5. Witnesses
     6. Exhibits
     7. Law & Court
     8. The Opposition
     9. Closing Statements
     10. Jury Charge
     11. Verdict and Post-Trial
     12. Daily Journal & Miscellaneous
      ** Index & Reference

Keep in mind that even though we’re listing sections in this order and about to provide you with some
forms to put in those sections, that this is more an offer of constructive suggestions than any sort of
insistence that you do things our way. This is all here as a place to start for the new folks and a fresh
perspective for those of you who’ve done this for a while.

On the next page, we’ll look at these sections and their contents in a little greater detail.

Trial Notebook Structure in a Little Greater Detail
Here we’ll expand each of the suggested notebook sections and list some of the recommended
contents (including some of the forms – shown in red text - which you’ll find in this ebook).

Title Sheet: Trial Information

    Just inside the cover, place an identifier to inconspicuously label your notebook and provide
    case/court info. We’ve provide an example for you called the “Trial Information” sheet.

Tabbed Sections: (Listed with suggested forms or subsections.)

1. Pre-Trial (Included is a generic Section Cover Sheet to use with any tabbed section.)

Since much of what happens in pre-trial will dictate the rest of your work to follow, keep copies

of all pertinent documents in with the rest of your trial work product. Maintain copies of all

motions, orders, pleadings, and the like.

 Charges / Summons        Pleadings                            Pre Trial Orders

 Motions in Limine        Trial Brief                          Bench Questions

2. Voir Dire & Jury Info

It would stand to reason that the next section should concern itself with the selection and early
pertinent information related to the jury. This area should include not only voir dire questions,
but any other piece of data related to the jury while the trial is active.

 Voir Dire Questions      Juror Data Sheet                     Jury Consultant Report
 Juror Questionnaire      Juror List / Seating Chart           Copy of Juror Notebooks

3. Opening Statements

Though initially this section will only house an outline of the presenting attorney’s “statement to

be,” use it to house the final transcript of your opening remarks along with the opposition’s.

 Opening Statements / Arguments Outline            Final Transcript of Opening

 Transcript of Opposition’s Opening

4. Presentation Schedule

The “meat and potatoes” portion of your Trial Notebook. Here is where you’ll place your main
presentation schedule outlining the issues related to your case and associated witness
testimony and evidentiary exhibits. This section is supported by the next two sections. Your
copy of your “Bench List,” or the abbreviated version of your presentation list that goes to the
judge, should be placed here as well. Also, since this section is the overview of your witnesses
and exhibits, it should also contain the executive summary provided by your investigator since
that work-product is from where some of your presentations have come.

 Presentation Schedule    Copy of Bench Copy                   Client Data Sheet

 Executive Summary of Investigator’s Report

5. Witnesses

This section is all about the people who will be called to support your side of the issues. Here,

you’ll place your witness list by itself along with the background material on each of them.

Please note that our Witness List and Exhibits List cross-reference each other.

 Client’s Testimony       Witness List                         Witness Information

                                           - 10 -
The Trial Notebook – an excerpt from “The Attorney Case File” - Courtesy of InfoQuest

6. Exhibits

Here is where you’ll list the various pieces of evidence or other informational exhibits and
presentations you’ll be making in court. You’ll note that our enclosed Exhibits List cross-
references with the Witness List. Also please note that you won’t necessarily place your
exhibits in this notebook, you’ll simply list their descriptive information and record where the
item is located in the folios, binders, or boxes you brought into court with you.

 Exhibits List                      Exhibit Info Worksheet            Exhibit Support Notes

7. Law & Court

Helping to bridge the gap between what you want to present and what the opposition will

present we place the information on how the trial will be governed and how exhibits and

witnesses will be handled. This section should house your Table of Points and Authorities

along with other supporting case and statutory law research results. It should also contain a

copy of the Bench Book or copy of any written rules for this particular court. And, if you should

choose to research any background information on prior cases this particular judge has tried

and how that judge tends to rule, place that here as well (at your own discretion of course).

 Table of Authorities               Judge Background                  Copy of Court Rules

 Case Law Research                  Statutory Law Research            Clerk Communication

8. Opposition’s Case

Just as you want to be able to find the background info on your case rather quickly, you’ll want

to do the same with the intel you’ve gathered on what the opposition is up to. Keep all of that

here. Note: If you absolutely have to make your notebook physically smaller, this is a good

section to put in a separate book.

 Opposition’s Witnesses             Witness Information               Impeachment Briefs

 Opposition’s Exhibits              Opposing Client Data              Discovery Index

9. Closing Statements

Though initially this section will only house an outline of the presenting attorney’s closing
argument, use it to house the final transcript of the remarks made along with those made by
the opposition. You always want to keep a copy of the opposition’s statements to make it
easier to review for improprieties and a copy of your own for reference or education.

 Closing Statements / Arguments Outline     Final Transcript of Closing Statements
 Transcript of Opposition’s Closing

10. Jury Charge

Many a case has been won or lost on appeal because of the information that a jury was or was

not given, or how their instructions from the court were worded or delivered. Make sure your

Jury Charge and Instruction copies are kept close at hand.

 Suggested Jury Charge              Opposition Jury Charge            Final Jury Charge

 Copy of Juror Instructions

11. Verdict and Post-Trial

Sadly, there is never a guarantee that any verdict is going to go your way. Verdicts are a part

of every trial so it stands to reason that your Trial Notebook contain a section to hold verdict-

related information to give you a starting point for post-trial work.

 Verdict Forms                      Post-Trial “To-Do” List           Copies: Post-Trial Filings

 Post-Trial Juror Interview

12. Daily Journal & Miscellaneous

There is no such thing as a trial without notes. Having a Daily Journal section gives you a
concise location to keep notes you’ve made, a list of motions or other issues to respond to or
follow up on, and to keep either the final transcript received from the court reporter or an
executive summary thereof.

 Daily Court Journal   Final Reporter Transcript

** Index & Reference (** A section, but not a numbered section.)

You should have a hardcopy Index & Reference for all the reasons previously mentioned, but

this is a document (or documents) that is easier to create electronically and then print to store

here. You want to have this section so you can find witnesses, exhibits, or electronic files that

may have somehow been misplaced or improperly categorized in other sections.

 Documents Listed by Control Number   Alphabetical Witness List

 Annotated List of Alphabetically or Numerically Organized Electronic Files

 Exhibits listed by internal Control Number and cross-referenced to court’s exhibit number.

Note: The forms listed above in red text are included in this ebook.

In the next section, “Useful Content,” we’ve provided copies of the forms listed in red text above.
Though this is a PDF format ebook, you can still print the forms to fill in by hand, scan them and read
them with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software, or use them as a model to create your own.
They’re just a very few of the forms and sections from The Attorney Case File (where our pages are
fully customizable by the user), but we’re here to help you make better Trial Notebooks so we thought
we’d give you some good templates to help get you started.

But that’s not all! There are still so many tips to give you that the next section following “Useful
Content” is called “Putting it All Together” where we’ve provided even more points on assembling both
your physical and electronic Trial Notebooks and for getting ready to present your case in court.

Structure is good! It’s hard to be
happy unless all the parts are together.

III. Useful Content

      Here’s where you’ll find copies of the forms listed in red text under “Basic Structure.” These are
      just some of the many pages from The Attorney Case File provided here to help make your office
      life easier.

      In this section you’ll find copies of:
                                                                                                                                     Pg.

          Trial Information: This is the cover sheet to go just inside your Trial Notebook. It will 15
          help you ID the notebook without having to put too much information on the outside.

          Section Cover Sheet (Generic). Use this template as a basic fill-in-the-blank cover 16
          sheet to use with each section. Start your notebook’s assembly by putting these pages
          in place and let them be your section “to do” lists for this particular trial.

          Juror Data Sheet: Depending on your area, area of law, and type of case, you may be 17
          allowed a certain latitude in the amount of background information you collect on jurors.
          Whatever you’re allowed to collect, this form has a place to record the information.

          Juror Questionnaire: A general questionnaire, this template offers a framework for 18
          constructing your own more in-depth survey tool for voir dire. You’ll note that several of
          the blanks prompt you to add your own questions or details.

          Juror List / Seating Chart: Whether you use a jury consultant or just want to know 19
          who’s who in the jury box, this worksheet will let you record names, notes, and seating
          position.

          Presentation Schedule: This page will let you outline your case in a chronological 20
          order showing which witnesses you want to call, the exhibit with which they’re
          associated, projected date of appearance, anticipated time length, media needs, and
          even the issue of the case to which it’s all related.

          Bench Copy of Presentation Schedule: A “lite” version of your Presentation 21
          Schedule, this is the copy you’d hand off to the bench to let the judge know more about
          your witnesses and exhibits and some of the related information.

          Client Data Sheet: In this case the sample we’ve provided is the “Civil Case” 22
          information sheet. This will help you gather some of the early data from your client to
          start the case.

          Witness List: A quick organizer to show the names of your witnesses along with 23
          pertinent presentation information.

          Witness Information: One of the things we’d like to point out about this form is that it 24
          prompts you to gather additional contact and tracking information about your witness.
          As cases drag on in court witnesses sometimes move or do other things that make it
          difficult to locate them when the next round of trials start. With this form you’ll have all
          the data you need in order to contact them again and again in the future.

          Exhibits List: A quick organizer to show the exhibits you’ll present along with pertinent 25
          information.

                                                                    - 13 -

                                                                                                                              Pg.
    Clerk Communication: Much of your communication with the court will be through the 26
    Clerk. Having a separate tracking sheet of these communication pieces will offer some
    redundancy so you’ll be sure nothing was missed.
    Opposition’s Witness Information: Just as you want to know everything you can 27
    about your own witnesses, this is doubly important for witnesses the opposition will call.
    This template prompts you for extended contact information as well as background
    information, impeachment notes, etc., that your investigation will uncover.
    Opposing Client Data: One of the most important people involved in the trial, you’ll 28
    want to know as much about the opposing client(s) as you possibly can. This page acts
    as the background investigation cover sheet for the data you’ll uncover.
    Post-Trial Juror Interview: There’s a reason they call it “practicing law.” You always 29
    learn something new every day. Interviewing the jury – whether you won or lost the
    case – provides good insight on what went right and wrong for both you and the
    opposition so you have something to build on next time.
    Daily Court Journal (and page 2): This one is a two-pager. Page one is the beginning 30
    of your in-court journal; the page where you keep notes regarding what went on in court
    on that day of trial. The second page is the basic copy for all following pages. These
    are included as a tool to help you take better-organized notes.

We’ve also provided a couple of checklists not listed in the tabbed sections discussed above:

    Trial Notebook Final Assembly Checklist: Always work from templates, forms, and 32
    checklists. Trial is not a place you want to realize you forgot something. Having a final
    assembly checklist helps you remember to include important details.
    Day of Court Checklist: Since redundancy is your friend in important events, this 33
    checklist is provided to make sure you have everything you need for court above and
    beyond your Trial Notebook.

So, enough discussion already, let’s show you the forms and templates! Remember, in a PDF
ebook, there’s only so much you can do with a sample form. With these you can print them to fill
in by hand, scan with OCR software, or use as a model for creating something else. In our full
system though, all files are in unlocked word processor formats so you can alter at will.

IV. Putting it All Together

      We started off with a short “Introduction” to make sure we’re all on the same page with what this ebook
      is about, we gave you a suggested Trial Notebook layout under “Basic Structure,” we provided a few of
      our many detailed templates in “Useful Content” and now it’s time to wrap it up and talk about “Putting it
      All Together.” Here we’ll discuss the thoughts, tips, and tricks we’d like to pass along so you have more
      in your toolbox to help with Organizing Your Materials, Physical Assembly of Your Notebook, Handling
      the Computer Files, and Prepping for Trial.

      The first tip we’ll give you here is the first item under “Top 10 Reasons to Create a Trial Notebook” from
      the Introduction section which is that reading through it is educational in and of itself. For that reason
      and that reason only, we’ve categorized the tips below but have not put them in any sort of additional
      order (contrary to our own admonishment to always be organized). Our feeling is that if you read
      through all of them, you’ll learn more than if you only skipped through looking for certain things.

      Organizing Your Materials

      These are the tips that can apply to the notebook, to your office, or to how you gather your pieces for
      trial in the first place. Like we said earlier, structure is good and structure depends on having all your
      resources together and organized.

         When do you start putting your notebook and related files together for trial? The answer is “Yes!

               Sort of.” You should always organize all your data from the very first second a client calls your
               office. That’s generally a given. And, you should be able to lay hands (or mouse) on these files
               at any given moment, because if you have to spend too much time sorting through your gathered
               data you’re wasting valuable Trial Notebook assembly time. However, you don’t want to jump
               the gun; you don’t want to waste company time assembling a Trial Notebook until it’s certain
               you’re going to trial. So balance the two and stay organized from day one and you’ll be ready to
               start on your notebook and trial prep should that become necessary.

         A key hint: Once you decide on a Trial Notebook structure, use that layout exclusively (in both

               hardcopy and softcopy formats) and make sure all attorneys and all staff members learn which
               parts are where. Familiarity improves speed of use.

         Putting your Section Cover Sheets into your Trial Notebook first turns the whole thing into its own

               to-do list making your life a little easier. Now all you do is fill in the blanks.

         If you use a color scheme for tabs, page color, highlights, printed text, etc., make it a uniform

               system for every case worked, and keep a legend in your office, and in the Trial Notebook. Do
               the same with your fonts or typestyles. One font might mean one thing, one font might mean
               another. Use a uniform system for bolding, italicizing, highlights, etc.

         However, regarding font colors, highlight colors, font style, bullet points, and all that to signify

               certain things, the first question to ask is, “Just how complicated do you want things to get?” It
               would be easy to get so bogged down in signaling, that you spend all your thought energy trying
               to figure out what a particular marker color means and you lose track of the more important
               points behind what you’re doing. If you choose a highlight or symbol system make it simple.

                                                                        - 34 -

 Hint: One of the many cross-reference things you should do is when you have an issue to bring

     out in recorded deposition, mark the location by line number in the hardcopy transcript and cross-
     reference that to time / marker location on video or audio (such as minutes or seconds). Caveat:
     If you’re using the court’s equipment, know how it marks or tracks the location of video or audio
     segments and you certainly want to know if it doesn’t track or mark parts or segments at all.

 Consider having a “Hold” sub-tab for witnesses or exhibits you have decided against using or

     extras you’re keeping in reserve. This keeps their info handy in case they later prove necessary.

 The key step in creating a great Trial Notebook is to organize your information from the very

     beginning. Use forms, templates, or whatever it takes to avoid having to go back and decipher
     unorganized notes from legal pads, etc. Most everything in life is like a computer; “Garbage in,
     garbage out.” Your Trial Notebook will be the same. Keep things organized from the beginning.

 Hint: Keep your old Trial Notebooks even if the case is long closed. Lessons learned in one trial

     often carry over to others, and this is definitely true if you focus on a narrow specialty.

 “Top 10 Productivity Tips for Trial Notebook Assembly”

     10. Avoid emails, phone calls, and other distractions. If you have to, leave the office to work.
     9. Do you work better with regular breaks, or with unbroken continuous work periods?
     8. Focus on only one trial at a time. Some offices try to “mass produce” and it can backfire.
     7. What’s your most focused time of day? Are you a morning or night person? Work then.
     6. Work from a Trial Notebook checklist (like this ebook) or refer to a good one you made before.
     5. Check your supplies. Do you have paper? Ink? Your laptop power cord? Set up for success.
     4. Copies of all pertinent materials and documents should be on hand. Searching wastes time.
     3. Have all production components on hand: notebook, laptop, CD/DVDs, thumb drives, etc.
     2. Does something like coffee or food work for you or against you? Adjust your diet accordingly.
     1. Work alone or in small numbers for the first assembly. Let a team review later.

Physical Assembly of Your Notebook

 If you use numbered tabs, make sure you have a key in the front, the back, and in the Daily

     Journal section so you can easily find sections from the most likely places you’d be while you’re
     in court.

 Preferably, you label your tabs using words. If you do, make sure the tabs are labeled on both

     sides. Remember, any awkward flipping or extended time searching looks bad in court to all
     present.

 Another hint for your tabs is to color code them. Use

     one color for your exhibits, another for items from the
     opposition and so on.

 Every section should have at least one cover, the tab       Use cover sheets and exercise
                                                              caution in court to keep prying
     divider page. This keeps prying eyes off your            eyes off your documents!
     documents. In our profession there have been too
     many incidents of “prying eyes” causing problems with
     cases or court proceedings. Keep this same thought
     in mind when you have your laptop screen up.

                                    - 35 -
        The Trial Notebook – an excerpt from “The Attorney Case File” - Courtesy of InfoQuest

     Consider getting a screen cover that only permits viewing from a very small direct angle, or at
     least have your “sleep mode” or screen saver only a keystroke away (so you can blank the
     screen without having to wait for it to time out).

 When making secondary books for others, i.e. judge, jury, and opposition, you might be tempted

     to scrimp on the opposition’s if you even do one at all (for discovery). But, remember this; what
     goes around comes around. Play fair, be nice, and treat everyone well. Consequently, you don’t
     want to spend too much money on the notebooks otherwise it looks like you’re trying to bribe,
     influence, or at least curry favor.

 Production hint: Since your notebook will be flipped through a lot, you’ll need a little durability

     with the pages and the punched holes if it’s going in a three-ring binder. First, print all your
     documents for the notebook on a slightly heavier paper. Standard printer / copier paper is a 20-
     pound paper. Go with about a 24-pound paper. Also, run a strip of cellophane tape down the
     inside margin of the paper on the front or back side before punching it for the binder. This is a
     much easier reinforcement than trying to go back later with those little adhesive “donuts” that fit
     around a punched hole.

 If your finished notebook is on the ponderous side, get in the habit of taking out the pertinent

     pages when you need them (such as your opening or closing statement outline) and immediately
     replacing the pages when done. Note: As much as anything else, the proper use of the Trial
     Notebook helps in creating good organizational habits and one leads to the other. Creating good
     Trial Notebooks teaches organization, and good organizational skills help in creating good Trial
     Notebooks.

 For your physical notebook, use only one if at ALL possible! It’s not a case of “all your eggs in

     one basket” since you have redundant softcopy backups, but being the easier format to use, it
     looks better if A), you have everything under “one roof” and B), with everything together you don’t
     forget one of the notebooks back at the office.

 You’ll notice in our suggested sections list, we have 13 categories (the “Baker’s Dozen” kind of

     13, not the unlucky kind) though we labeled the last one with ** rather than a number. Here’s
     why: You can find 12-tab divider sets along with a ton of other set sizes (5 tabs and up) at your
     favorite office supply store. For the odd tab, simply keep a set of blank dividers and use a
     different one of them each time you make a notebook. The final tab would be marked “Index”
     anyway so it shouldn’t matter if the rest of your sections are divided by numbered tabs or named
     labels. That’s why the Index & Reference section is marked **.

 Just as you tailor the Trial Notebook to the lead attorney, you should also tailor the Presentation

     Schedule Bench Copy to the Judge or Court. Different Judges or Courts may prefer (or outright
     require) different formats. The thing to check is whether they would appreciate a redundant copy
     in a different format. For example, a court may require that all copies of Trial Notebooks be in
     electronic softcopy format, whereas the Judge may be “old school” and like a nice paper
     hardcopy. Another thing to think about is that if they do like a paper hardcopy, what are they
     more appreciative of? Three-ring binder? Comb binding? Spiral binding? One caveat though.
     Where your attorney might appreciate having that nice leather-bound expensive looking binder,
     giving something like that to a judge might be construed as attempted influence. Make your
     bench book professional and presentable yet economical.

 On the subject of sub tabs in your physical notebook: Colored Post-It ® tabs are so easy to use,

     but please resist the urge to use them too often. Having a few is fine when you need to mark
     something for quick access, but otherwise, too many looks unprofessional. (In fact, having too
     many will look like you just slammed your book shut on a Parrot!) Instead, you can either use a
     numbered set of tabs, another set of blank dividers, or a “peel and stick” tab so you can more
     neatly mark the subsections you need to access while in court.

                                                              - 36 -

 You’ll notice that some of the sample forms we’ve provided in this ebook have the titles repeated

     at the top and bottom. That’s because a good many of our clients prefer a top bound notebook
     or classification folder system and having the title repeated at the bottom makes finding a
     particular page easier. Consider this level of detail and thought when you go to create your own
     forms and pages.

 Depending on the size of the case and the amount of witnesses, exhibits, and other data, you

     might want to create two notebooks; one for your case and the other for the opposition’s. This
     makes navigation easier, it makes division of duties easier and faster (if you have to look
     something up during a tense moment in court), and it makes for better portability since you only
     have to pick up half the material as you’re pouring over one book or the other. Color-code the
     two notebooks if you do this. However, if at all possible, keep everything in one notebook. It’s
     harder to lose parts that way.

 Whatever format the lead attorney prefers, have the Trial Notebook available in that format, but

     always, ALWAYS have a redundant backup in the other format (softcopy - in several formats - or
     hard copy). Going green is good, but earning green is just as important, so don’t blow the case
     just to save some paper. Leave the electronic copy requirements for the volumes of paper
     exhibits that have to be shuttled back and forth as part of Discovery, and for eDiscovery.

 The redundant backup rule also applies to key exhibits. For example, a witness statement

     should be prepared in all available and applicable formats. If there is a video deposition, there
     should be a hardcopy transcript (verified), the video should be saved on both disk and thumb
     drive (flash drive) and in various video formats depending on the requirements / capabilities of
     your electronic equipment and that of the court. For video, an audio file backup should be made
     just as you’d make a hard copy transcript of the audio.

 Where it’s important to have an original document, place a photocopy of the original in your Trial

     Notebook if needed while the original resides in your file box or is already in the court’s
     possession as evidence. In many cases, the location of a physical piece of paper indicates its
     value. For example, a piece of paper in the Trial Notebook can have handwritten notes added at
     will. A piece of paper in the file box should not be touched, altered, or marred.

 If you choose something like an expensive leather binder,             Write
                                                                        Junk
     don’t make it so expensive that you can’t file it away for years   Here!
     at a time while the case progresses through various steps.

 You should have a sub-section on “lessons learned” in each

     Trial Notebook, or at least as part of your “Court Journal.”
     After all, it’s called practicing law.

   Speaking of detail, please notice that we did not number this       Though this is a hardcopy
                                                                        notebook, it doesn’t help.
        ebook like a normal book. We started with the very first title  Work from templates,
        page because we knew we would be giving this book away in       forms, and checklists.
        PDF format, and we wanted the PDF’s page numbers to
        match the ebook’s page numbers. This is another tiny
        example of not only the kind of detailed thought we apply to
        what we do, but an example of the detail you should use.

Handling the Computer Files

 Even if most of your data storage is electronic, and discovery is eDiscovery, we still suggest you

     have a hardcopy version of your Trial Notebook. The more important the situation, the more a
     little redundancy is your friend.

- 37 -
The Trial Notebook – an excerpt from “The Attorney Case File” - Courtesy of InfoQuest

 Thumb drives should all be labeled with a name, case number, or drive serial number and that

     information entered into the “where stored” blank on your various forms and Index & Reference.

 Laptop computers should also be inconspicuously labeled. There would be nothing more

     embarrassing than to say “Oops! I left that file in my other computer!”

 Just as you have your Trial Notebook in both hardcopy and softcopy formats, your electronic

     information should be saved in a variety of formats to ensure universal accessibility. Save things
     in their native format and make electronic copies in PDF, TXT, DOC, PPT, or XLS formats. For
     example, if you have a PowerPoint ® presentation you’d like to make, only the PowerPoint
     software doesn’t want to cooperate, you can save the PPT or PPS file as a PDF and use Adobe
     to show the slides. You’ll lose some of your special effects, but it will work in a pinch.

 Now that we’ve mentioned the possibility of losing your special effects, we feel it prudent to ask

     you to not use special effects unless absolutely necessary. Keep things simple for the jury.

 Your hardcopy and softcopy pages should look just alike. Use the same document format in

     your physical notebook as you do on computer. If you have to switch back and forth you want to
     be able to read and navigate one as easily as the other and having to decide which is what or
     where on different formats does nothing but waste time and cause confusion. Uniformity is one
     of the keys of efficiency.

 If your firm handles a variety of cases, come up with a case and file numbering system that will

     tell you at a glance what type of case you’re working (criminal vs. civil, tax vs. tort, family vs.
     corporate, etc.) and also whether or not you’re representing the plaintiff or defendant.

 In your softcopy version, you can use internal hyperlinks from key words or names to definitions,

     exhibit notes, or background info. Internal hyperlinks are easy to make in most word processors.

 Become an insatiable file saver or backup person. Learn the “save hotkey” for any software

     package you might use. For example, in Microsoft Word ® and Excel ® hitting “Ctrl S” (the
     Control key and the letter S key) will save the current document. You can make it an almost
     unconscious habit to hit Ctrl-S every minute or so and never have to worry about losing important
     files in those “Murphy’s Law” moments where the power goes out or the computer “hiccups.”
     Also, change the “auto save” time length. For Microsoft Word ® you do this by going to “Tools”
     then “Options” then click on the “Save” tab. You’ll see an option that says “Save AutoRecover
     info every..:” and then you’ll see a box where you can change the number of minutes governing
     how often the auto-save feature saves your current file.

 One of the things we constantly point out to people is

     that the software systems that came loaded on their
     computers are probably far more useful than most of
     us know. They’ll do so much already that we tell most
     of our readers / clients to learn what their computers
     will do already before investing in higher-end software-
     oriented case management or trial notebook packages.

 Check all flash drives, files, and file storage devices for  Though we focus on hardcopy
                                                               Trial Notebooks, never walk in to
     viruses, spyware, and keystroke loggers before loading    court without a softcopy backup.
     them on your office computers and certainly before
     loading them on the computer you’ll be taking to court.

 Consider adding a small box to each document template you create for your office where you

     show the filename for the template. This helps you find it more easily because you don’t have to

- 38 -

        stop and think “Now which of these cover sheet filenames is the one I want?” You’ll notice on
        some of our forms we provide that same item along with a blank for “Document Control #.”

   Make sure pretty much everything you do or create has some sort of internal “Document Control

        Number” such as “Bates Numbering.” Hint: If you have your files saved in Microsoft ® format(s),
        they’re searchable for keyword content. This means that if you know a document control number
        and it’s typed into a document somewhere, you can tell various search features already loaded
        with Windows ®, to search inside a series of documents to find the document(s) containing that
        number (or any other key word or phrase).

   In addition to your firm’s internal document control number, be sure to list accepted / admitted

        items by the court’s exhibit number and cross-reference with your “Index & Reference” section.

   Hint: Assign an ID number to your thumb drives, or at least label them with the case number for

        the trial. Do the same with CDs / DVDs, and other removable storage devices that will be
        dedicated to this one particular case or trial. In addition to labeling them, list them in the Index.

   Another hint: When upgrading laptops or buying new ones, try to make sure they all match and

        that they all use the same version of the same operating system. This way everyone knows how
        to work all the computers. Uniformity is one of the keys to efficiency. Speaking of computers:

Prepping for Trial

This part might seem redundant since this whole ebook is about prepping for trial, but this portion is a
small set of ideas to help get you ready for court that have little to do with making a Trial Notebook,
though some parts are related, and more about readying you to use your notebook in trial. We just felt
compelled to give you all the help we could.

   Use the same Trial Notebook template / model for all court cases, not just the bigger more

        important ones. The reason being, you want to know your Trial Notebook system forward and
        backward so when the more important cases come up you’re focusing on the case and not trying
        to remember all the details you need in your files.

   Call a colleague, preferably someone in the same firm but uninvolved in this trial, to read through

        your notebook. It should make sense to them even though they may be unfamiliar with the

                                                                  - 39 -

issues, people, and exhibits. They should feel like they could take on the case if your notebook
was handed off to them.

 Prepare an “office supply box,” a small one, and keep handy items such as paper clips, stapler,

     binder clips, markers, breath mints, etc. (Hint on mints: These help make sure the presenter’s
     throat is hydrated and their voice is as smooth and even as possible.)

 Review the Trial Notebook with available staffers, even if not all of them are involved in that

     particular trial. This does 2 things. One, it gives you fresh sets of eyes and ears who can help
     you spot errors, inconsistencies, or contradictions, and two, if a firm member who is part of the
     trial is absent for whatever reason, their replacement is at least a little familiar with the trial’s
     focus and issues.

 One of the worst things you can do is sit in front of your client the day of (or just before) trial and

     put your Trial Notebook together. The Trial Notebook should be in a constant state of assembly
     from the day trial is a probability. Last minute efforts do nothing but undermine your client’s
     confidence in you as their legal representative. Since one of the purposes of a good Trial
     Notebook is client confidence, they should get to see the Trial Notebook assembly in progress
     and should be asked on occasion to review portions thereof. Indeed, the act of a thorough
     investigation itself will almost produce your Trial Notebook in rough draft format.

 Review with the client is good for several reasons.

First, the chief complaint among clients is a lack of

communication from their attorney. Second, trial is

nerve wracking on any client – regardless how

many times they may have been there – and

knowing how thorough your preparations are can

help make them more at ease. Third, they may be

able to add that one crucial detail that you either

omitted or they forgot to tell you (better to know

now). Fourth, review also reconfirms to the client

their position in the trial so as to reinforce

reasonable and legitimate expectations of probable

outcome and preps them so they know what is

going to happen and when during the trial process.     When possible and permissible,

                                                       let your client review your work.

 Another thought with having your client review your

material with you is potential malpractice reduction. Though your client is a layman so to speak,

and has hired your firm as their representative, you might allay the claims of “I didn’t know what

was going on” or “I didn’t know that was going to come up in court” or “My attorney never

communicated with me” by including the client in as many steps as possible. This is the reason

you’ll find “Client’s Signature” or “Reviewed by Client” on some of the Trial Notebook forms.

Though this holds little to no weight regarding existing precedent, good communication and

documentation can go a long way toward protecting you on a number of fronts against

unforeseen issues.

 If you have multi-media presentations or slide shows, practice presenting them as often as you

     can. Being familiar with the material and smooth in its presentation carries a lot of weight
     regarding your image and how you’re perceived in court.

 Also keep in mind that “prepping for trial” is an on-going process that doesn’t only occur when a

     case is scheduled for court. There are quite a number of skills above and beyond good Trial
     Notebook assembly that lend themselves well to success in a court of law. On the next page
     we’ve put together a quick list of eleven different ways to keep yourself ready for trial.

   “Top 11 Ways to Improve Your Trial Skills”

        11. Volunteer to help the indigent. Practice makes perfect, so the more time spent in court…
        10. Take a creative writing class. This will help teach creative thought and organized writing.
        9. Take law-related Continuing Ed classes through your Bar Association or local college.
        8. Be part of a Debate Club. Practice combining reason, logic, and persuasion.
        7. Take Software Classes. The better you are with a computer, the easier presentations will be.
        6. Join a mystery book of the month club. Reading a good mystery is good brain exercise.
        5. Constantly work word, math, and spatial puzzles to keep your analytical brain exercised.
        4. Take a course on private investigation. This will also help develop analytical thinking.
        3. Visit an image consultant. How you come across to others in court is very important.
        2. Watch your diet, rest, and exercise. Stable energy levels help you focus and concentrate.
        1. Join Toastmasters. The better you can speak in public the better you’ll be in court.

Since we like adding our little numbered lists, here’s one more to condense some of the more important
points we’ve made to sum up this section:

   Putting it All Together - A Final Step by Step Synopsis:

        1. Put together your Trial Notebook shell using a three-ring binder and the tab dividers.
        2. Insert the Trial Information Sheet and fill out the Section Cover Sheets.
        3. Load the Trial Notebook using the Section Cover Sheets as your “to-do” checklists.
        4. Coordinate the loading of your Trial Notebook with the organization of your electronic files.
        5. Print your “Index & Reference” pages and insert them in that section.
        6. Review each section with the supervisor, presenting attorney(s), and the client.
        7. Record the fact that each section was reviewed on the section’s cover sheet.
        8. Compare the hardcopy Trial Notebook to the electronic version.
        9. Review your redundant electronic backups to make sure all presentations will work.
        10. Fill out your “Day of Court Checklist” to help you remember everything you’ll need.

One of the things that will make your life easier is if you had everything you needed not only for
assembling a Trial Notebook at the click of a mouse, but the detailed checklists you’d want to have
when working the whole case from the beginning so as to not miss a single detail. The one thing worse
than you not having something like this is if your opposition does!

This next section is important since it’s here you’ll learn about the origin of everything you’ve been
given so far, and a valuable resource that can make your law office management, case management,
and Trial Notebook production much simpler. Let’s learn about the source.

                                                                  - 41 -

      V. About the Source

        Everything given to you thus far has come from The Attorney Case File.
        This is the package you need that will make all the difference in the world
        with organizing your cases, work product, and trial appearances.

        The few sample forms we’ve provided here don’t even begin to do the system
        justice. The Attorney Case File is a three-component system made up of
        nearly 200 pages of interrelated forms, templates, and checklists, all of which
        carry the detail to keep you on track, the appearance to enhance your professional image, lifetime usage
        for one single price, at a cost low enough to recoup your investment when you save one billable hour.
        How much time has this ebook alone saved you already?

        The three components are the Case / Client Workbook, Investigation Workbook, and the Trial Notebook:

              1. The Case / Client Workbook acts as the central coordinator for all your cases and works
                   with a variety of types of law whether you’re working a criminal defense case, either side of
                   a civil case, or any number of other areas of law.

              2. The Investigation Workbook is a complete “investigation in a box.” If you hire outside
                   investigators, you can set the parameters under which they operate and make sure they
                   don’t miss a detail. If you have an in-house investigator, this section helps set them up for
                   success like no other package available from any other source.

              3. The Trial Notebook is made up of the forms and worksheets you’ve seen here and more.
                   Like we said, there’s only enough room in an ebook to give you a few pages.

        The next thing you should do is visit our site to learn more about our complete system and the long list of
        benefits we don’t have room to list here.

electrical tape, one of our web pages we were working on, and too much time on our hands. That’s when things happen! Just thought you
should know that no people, animals, or trees were harmed in the making of this ebook although billions of electrons were temporarily
inconvenienced.)
